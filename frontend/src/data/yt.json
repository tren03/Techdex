    "transcript": "hi everyone this is gkcs in this videowe'll be talking about applicationprogrammable interfaces or in short apisthe key word here in this full form isinterfaces the easiest way to think ofthis is functions you have a return typeyou have the method name itself and youhave the arguments that you're going topass into this function you can code ingolang python in the back end and youcan code in JavaScript and ASP on thefront end and still it will work thebest examples of apis that I have foundis actually from the Indian governmentso you have contracts literallydocuments PDF files written by thegovernment mentioning exactly whatyou're going to get as a response if youhit the assistanceso how do apis fit in the larger schemeof things well firstly you have somebodywho's going to call this API this greendesktop over here which has loaded a webpage the web page is let's sayintegrity.io and you click a button themoment you do that that's an actionwhich requires some sort of data so thecode running on your mobile device onyour web page is going to use JavaScriptto create a request object and send itacross the wire the gateway then looksat what API has been called by thisrequest I mean where is this request tobe routed we have spoken about this inthe previous video of API gateways youcan expose apis using rest or graphqlboth have their pros and cons graphql isa little more popular these days becauseit just sends you the data that you needto get and you also need to just sendthe data that you want to change sothat's pretty good rest has some otherbenefits like HTTP caching so you mightwant to use that alsosimilarly you might have externalsystems which you want to connect to soif a payment has been made to PayPalthen I want to know when the payment wascompleted and what is the amount rightyou know for what reasonso this is done using web hooks whichare very similar to apis but yousubscribe to webbooks okay the benefitof this is that you don't need to keeppinging PayPal saying that you know doyou get any payment did you get anypayment it's not polling if you're goingto get the response when there is aresponseso what makes a good API here's achecklist that you can use to just gothrough your apis and clear your codereviews with flying colors the firstthing is atomicity autonomicity meansthat you do an operation either entirelyor don't do it at all so if you areloading let's say a value to cash so yougo to the database get that value put itin the front of the queue if it's a lrucache and then send a response if any ofthis fails in between then everythingshould fall back so when you got thevalue from the databaseand you were not able to put it in thefront of the queue maybe don't give backa response Okay the reason I'm sayingthis for cash it's not that importantbut for some operations you havemultiple things happening together andyou want either all of them to go aheador none of them to happenit's easy to debug such operations thesecond thing is idem potency itempotency means that if you make the samerequest multiple times to the samesystemthe operation is performed just onceokay important to note is that if I sayadd 10 Rupees to my balance and then Isay add 10 Rupees more it that doesn'tmean that it won't go to 20 that will goto 20. but if I give a ID of 50 Okayid50 add 10 Rupees to my balancethen I send the same request with id50the server knows that I have alreadypassed this request I've already donesomething with this request so I don'tneed to pass it againI can ignore all the operations that areto be done and give back a responsesaying it's a success I had done thisearlierthe third thing is errors errors areextremely important in fact they Definethe adoptability of API like people arenot going to use your API unless theyfeel like the errors are clear so clearerror codes 200 means that everything isgood anything in the 200 range 200 to299 uh anything between 400 to 499 meansthat something went wrong and it'sprobably a permission issue or it's anissue on your side I couldn't find theobject uh anything above 500 probablymeans that the server messed up maybethe service is down it's unavailable sothat's the basic ranges these are commonHTTP codes that you wouldbe wise to adopt in your own apis thesecond thing is if you're sending backerror responses please make them humanreadableone of the things that happens is youhave this error and then you have all ofthe application stack printed out forthe client to see that's firstly asecurity issue but the second thing isthe client doesn't know what went wrongI mean did I send a null objectsomewhere now I have to run through mylogs and check it's much easier to justtell them exactly what random okay uhand this is one step ahead you can havenot just descriptive but prescriptiveerror messages and hey your username istoo short we can't allow that in thesystem instead of saying username notallowedwhat does that mean you tell them whatthey need to do to get the thing donecorrectly this is especially useful ifyou have B2B Communications businessesare communicating with you which arethey're going to open their logs andthey're going to check the responses ofyour API right uh they don't have a UIto play with they literally depend onyour error messages that's the onlything that they can seethe some of the other things that youcan do to make your apis smooth is uhuse the open API specs these are reallygood uh using swagger usually does thisautomatically Swagger will also generatethe documentation around the API likethe basic documentation around it foryouand if you need to test an API you canuse Curl or Postman postman has thisnice wrapper which is better than curlin my opinion of course uh Postman is afull-fledged UI so that you can testyour apisnow here's a war story which is a truestory and unfortunately this happenedwhen we were using a third partyapplication to connect with aadhaar thesystem that I just traced so this thirdparty application suckedto put it simply it was a B2Bapplication in which case Engineers areexpecting your error messages and yourAPI responsesto be correct okay to be according tothe contract that you have mentionedunfortunately uh people were writingsuccess sometimes with the capitalsometimes the small sometimes in allcaps so our back end was breakingbecause the string matching eventuallyhad to be that match equals ignore caseso that was same the other thing whichwas I think much worse was that we weregetting responses with 200. so HTTP 200means that everything is fineand the response was error username notfoundlikeif it's 200 the application will thinkthat things are fine the clientlibraries which send HTTP requests getback responses and take that as acompleted future as a you know like ifyou have a promise in JavaScript thenthat has successfully completedand these guys are going to send anerror response in that so wheneveryou're sending responses please use thecodes correctly the codes are extremelyextremely useful because uh the otherperson's application might be dependingon your error code not on the messagethat you havefinally when we integrated the system werealized that the bytes being sent tothis third party were being sent overthe wire so this is aadhaar informationso that's pretty confidential you canthink of it as Social Security right youhave your Biometrics being sentwithout encryption sowe did that we had to talk with themthis is aperson to person thing it's not reallythat you write your contract butwhenever you're reading thedocumentation you should check whatthey're expecting and if the expectationis weird and is not good for the usersthat you have on the other side do bringit up do let them know that in thedocumentation itself in the API itself Ican see problems forget about yourinternal implementationso that's all I have for today I hopeyou write some good apis I hope you testthem well and I hope you have thedocumentation written well so that thefront-end engineers and other clientswho are using your apis are super happywith the documentation and testing uhand if they're not then well you cantell them I'm working on it until nexttime see you bye",
    "summary": "This video focuses on creating impeccable APIs, emphasizing key considerations before deploying them to production. The core concept revolves around APIs as interfaces, analogous to functions with defined return types, method names, and arguments. The presenter uses the example of the Indian government contracts to illustrate well-defined API documentation. API calls are described in the context of a user action on a webpage, highlighting the role of the API gateway, the choice between REST and GraphQL, and the use of webhooks for external system integration (e.g., PayPal payments).\n\nThe video then presents a checklist for designing good APIs. Key elements discussed include atomicity (all or nothing operation), idempotency (same request multiple times performs the operation only once), and proper error handling. On the errors, the video stresses the importance of clear and human-readable error messages alongside standard HTTP error codes (200s, 400s, and 500s). Descriptive and prescriptive error messages are recommended, especially for B2B communications, providing users with actionable guidance instead of vague failures. The video also briefly mentions utilizing the Open API specification (Swagger) for documentation and testing tools like Curl and Postman.\n\nThe video concludes with a \"war story\" about integrating with a third-party API that exposed several crucial problems. These include inconsistent success message formatting, HTTP 200 responses with error messages in the body, and, critically, transmitting sensitive data (Aadhaar/Social Security information) without encryption. The anecdote reinforces the importance of adhering to API contracts, using HTTP codes correctly, and ensuring data security. The speaker encourages thorough documentation, rigorous testing, and open communication with API providers to address potential issues and ensure client satisfaction."

    "transcript": "today we're going to talk aboutdesigning microservice architectures theright way and I thought to start it'd behelpful to share a personal story that Ihope resonates with many of you so thenames will be unnamed but it basicallygoes like thiscould you please change this URL fromphu kham slash latest slash bar to phukham slash one point five point threeslash bar and the answer is sorry thatwould take weeks we don't have theresources to do that it's just afrigging URL and we have to ask how doesthat happen and in this particular casethis was a URL in a library there arehundreds of services to update manyother services have not been updated ina long period of time which means thatupdating that service means updating itsdependencies which just frankly takestime it is actually the reality of thework to do it and incredibly frustratingright I mean super super frustratingwhen a simple task ends up beingcomplicated or time-consuming inpractice and this is where I think greatarchitecture can really help us and wetalk about great architecture I thinkwhat we're really after is a few keyfeatures one is this idea that we canscale development teams develop deliverhigher quality software enable ourselveshave a choice are we really after highperformance or Reaktor low cost and toactually be able to make changes thatdrive what we really like in ourbusiness and I think one of the definingcharacteristics of great architectureand this is the hard one it's a supportfuture features not naturally and theway we like to think about this whenwe're designing something do we have agood design I don't know I'll let youknow in three four years and when wefind out how everybody would like to useit and whether or not we make gooddecisions today that's ultimately a goodthat's ultimately when we learned and wetalked about not-so-great architecture Ithink it often looks like this peoplelike to talk about spaghettigoto gets a lot of memes out there but Ithink really what's happening is we'retrading near-term velocity for what Ilike to call future paralysis and Ithink in the micro service architecturespace certainly we've personally haveseen this in many many examples wherewe're tempted bythe benefits of micro services and weunderestimate or under invest in what isneeded to build a great architecture andthis is what we end up with we end upwith one to two weeks of work to changea URL and so today's talk is aboutdesigning micro service architecturesthe right way and frankly how do weavoid spaghetti and make a perfectlycrafted meal fey we're layer after layeritself is simple perfect and togetherthe whole is greater than the sum of itspartsbriefly my backgroundtoday the co-founder and CTO of anenterprise SAS company called Flocommerce Flo Daiohwhere we build software that helpsbrands expand internationally from dayone we built our company on microservices with many of the lessons welearned in our prior experience prior tothat was the co-founder and CTO of giltcalm if you're familiar with giltlarge-scale micro service architecture Ithink probably over 400 applications nowquite a large company over a thousandpeople six seven hundred million inannual revenue at the point in time thatwe sold the company to Hudson Bay and Ithink it was there that we reallylearned a lot about the benefits ofmicro service architectures in terms ofscaling teams delivering qualityisolation performance as well as many ofthe challenges and frankly areas wherein hindsight we wish we had investedmore and that's what today's talk willfocus on let's start with a fewmisconceptions misconception number onemicro services enable our teams tochoose the best programming languagesand frameworks for their tasks this isoften cited as one of the big benefitsof micro services I can build oneservice and go one service in rust oneservice in node and one service andwhatever language gets invented tomorrowthe reality is and we'll demonstratethis today it is super super expensiveto adopt new programming languages andframeworks and really the bigger barhere is team size and the level ofinvestment into the architecture onemetric is if we look at Google as agenerally great engineering company theyhave about I don't know let's call it20,000 30,000 engineers at last countthey have eight programming languages soI like to say one programming languagefor every 4,000 engineers as a goodmetricmisconception number two cogeneration isevil I used to think this and thereality is cogeneration is just atechnique and what's really importantespecially in these micro servicearchitectures is creating a definedschema that is actually a hundredpercent trusted and today we'lldemonstrate one technique that we usequite a bit we're at flow we'releveraging a significant amount ofcogeneration in different parts of oursoftware development processmisconception number three the event logmust be the source of truth so when wewere starting flow I also thought thisand I reached out to Jake reps who wrotecough-cough Co and wrote the paper thedefinitive paper I think on logging thatmany people here surely read and I andhe really helped us as we were spacescaling guilt and I said Jay I don't getitI've got a rest service and I'm creatinga user what am I supposed to do publishan event wait for that event to comeback to my service so that I can respondto my client because after my clientcreates a user they may want to get thatusers details so how do I guarantee thatI have those users details and from thehorse's mouth II said no no no you justsaw that in database that's fine and sothat's what we didthe resources are stored in databasesthat belong to the micro services butthen we guarantee absolutely at leastone semantics that those messages aregoing to end up on the event stream it'sokay so okaymisconception number four developers canmaintain no more than three serviceseach this is certainly true at gilt afew folks from Netflix shared that theratio of three services for developerinto being kind of this like magicnumber and you get to that number andthen you stop feature development andall you do is babysit and maintain allyour services I think this is the wrongmetric to focus on and if you're havingconversations about this metric I thinkit's a clear sign that you need toinvest in automation and tooling andwe'll go through a lot of the tooling wehave here today flow were in our thirdyear we have about a hundred servicesand the ratio is about five services perengineer and every week we ask peoplehow much time is being spent onmaintenance the portion of maintenancethat goes into maintaining and lovingour micro services of less than fivepercent so it's absolutely doable sowe'll touch on the flow architecturebecause this is driving a lot of thecontent today so distributed microservice architecture add flow over 100micro-services each one of them definesa REST API all of our servicescommunicate via api's and on the bottomevents every service publishes events ofinterest there is a lambda architectureat the bottom but I think the key thinghere is there's a lot of services thatare interacting together we do a fewthings that are quite unique which isone we don't have a private network andthat means that all of the products thatwe build our UIs are actually built onthe same API so that we offer ourclients there is just one set of API sand events to flow one of the keypractices and I think the first criticaldecision to make in going into a microservice architectures is how are yougoing to manage and define your API sand here we're going to talk about RESTAPI as we'll talk about events in a bitthis is what an API looks like at flowthe very first artifact and step ofsoftware development app flows thedesign of the API a few critical thingsit's not in code it's not annotations incode it has to be language neutral hereyou see this is an example we use JSONsecond we define resources everything isresource first at flow and that's whyhere you see a definition of a user oruser as an ID email name status and thenby convention to create a user you usean object that is the resource nameunderscore form so in our language formsare used to create instances ofresources and there you can see the datadefined for the resource one small thingjust because it's 2018 gdpr which is thenew privacy regulation for Europe whicha lot of people have had to scramble andinvests you comply with in an API firstworld we simply added an annotationwhere we can add a field level say forexample email is considered personaldata and from that we can automaticallygenerate a complete trace through everysingle service at flow for anything thatmay contain email we know we don't haveto guess it's programmatic we know andthat's possible because we start withthe API definitions so we've got ouruser how do we actually interact withthe user this is how we create let'scall operations on the API what wereally do is we take a user resource andwe expose that we say here's a resourceit's a user it has two operations one isthey get by ID the second is at post thepost accepts a body of type user formand this is how you create a user soagain we're taking our user resource andthen exposing our user model and thenexposing that as a resourceis what makes it available through theAPI what does it mean for API to befirst class the API definitions are notin the micro service repos they are in adedicated git repo called API how do youmake a change to an API you open a texteditor you modify the JSON file and youcreate a pull request what happens whenyou create a pull requestwell of course continuous integrationwhy wouldn't we run automated tests onthe definition of our API and so hereyou can see an example of a pull requestin gilt and get just on the definitionof the API we've been touchedimplementation people can collaborate wecan have feedback through the standardtools that we use and on the right thereyou see a set of linters that have runover the definition of the API what's alinter look like here's an example of areal linter so linters do lots of thingsbut ultimately our goal with all of ourone of the big goals of continuousintegration on the api definition isthat it really should feel like oneperson wrote the entire API yourcustomers don't care about develop yourteam one and Team two having differentopinions on how rest works they careabout using software from your companyin a consistent way and automatedlinters on the API definition is apretty powerful tool just make sure thatthings feel that way so this is just asimple example of a linter that walksthrough the entire service the serviceis an instance of the entire API andjust validates that everybody is definedpaths in lower case as an examplebreaking changes in api's so from apolicy perspective what's reallyinteresting is like we're actuallyempowered to just make a decision to saywe don't break things that actually isjust a decision that we get to make weget to make that decision for databasesand schema design there we can make thesame decision in API so we just decidedon't break api's that's it you justdecide it really is that simple once youmake that decision though and I thinkit's a critical decision to make now youhave to build practices around that andone of those practices is to make surethat you know that you may be about tobreak an API and so this is an examplethese examples are from a tool calledAPI builder which is something westarted at gilt it's an open source andfree hosted solution for a 10-10 APIdesigns a lot of these practices and oneof the really nice things that comesnative is annotation of every singlechange at a detail level in the APIincludethings that are breaking so trivial nowif you want to just add a continuousintegration test that says did you breakyour API if so the build failed rightand at least build a process to reviewit and so you'll know you can build thatinto the process and also superinteresting that this is happening inthe API design phase right so beforewe've built any code or really investedin implementation or any UATwe already know upfront that wait aminute we're on a path that may be abreaking change and now we can make thedecisions that's something we want to door do we want to course-correct and it'scheap to course-correct cuz this is thevery very beginning of the process thisis cool by the way I mean I think it isgreat so now we can go ahead and startimplementing our service we've got ourAPI user recent user model Muse reformeduser resource let's go do some stuff sothis is the first time we get into codegeneration if you're using G RPC or anybinary protocols you probably alreadyusing code generation here I think thereally important thing about codegeneration is that there areopportunities to say the specificationis in fact the first-class thing that webuilt don't duplicate that anything thatcan be driven off the specificationthere's an opportunity to do it eitherthrough reflection dynamically orthrough code generation in particularbecome a fan of code generation becauseit's really easy for anybody to read thecode and we invest heavily in thegenerators we write to make themreadable so that you can really reallyunderstand what's happening withouthaving to dig through meg and Meg ofsource code in libraries that you maynot be familiar familiar with so here'san examplewe run API builder update for the appuser and this created three this itgenerated three types of things theroutes file a client and a mock clientso let's go and look at them for theroutes file all of our micro services atflow are written in scala and play andin play the way that you respond to anHTTP HTTP request is you declare a routeso we automatically generate this routefile from the API builder specificationget users by ID post users this isreally nice because now we'reguaranteeing that our implementation ithas these methods defined rightbecause when we generate the routes knowand everyone compiled the compilercomplains because these things don'texist so we can actually have aguarantee that the operations that areexposed on our resources in our APIactually are in fact implemented by theservice another thing to note is userfriendly paths and we didn't actuallyspecify the path we can provide somenice defaults that are restful andconsistent naming this is also reallyimportant users get by ID users post ifI told you we had a feature calledcompany you could probably now guessthat to create a company it's going tobe called companies that post to get acompany it's gonna be companies that getby ID and that consistency again isreally really important because we wantthe API to feel like it was built by oneperson for all of our users that areusing our API whether they're internalor for our clients code generating aclient library so this is a clientlibrary that's used to communicate fromwith any of the services through theREST API and this is an example of theimplementation the post method this oneis in Scala using play JSON butessentially the key things here are thisentirely generated from thespecification again and really friendlyto use as a developer it's dot post andyou pass in an instance of a user formand that's it it corresponds and againthe key message here is this littlevalue to developers writing this overand over again and as you buildmicroservices you'll have lots of themand you're gonna spend all your timewriting client libraries and then youimagine you introduced a second languageall of a sudden your clients want sayyou spell internally like us your clientwants interact with you and Ruby or andgo or whatever now you have to take allthose fine libraries that you wrote andwrite them again in every singlelanguage and that work while valuablestarts to compete with work that youcould be doing in terms of performancetuning implementing more featuresbuilding new product so I think this isreally really important and in theindustry where I think a lot of thingsfall down is when building codegeneration I think a lot of people justoptimize to make things possible butthat's not the intent the goal here isto make the generated client so nicethat a developer will love using itbecause only then will developers notwrite their own handcrafted clientlibrary and third we'll look atgenerating a mock client we're gonnatalk a lot about testingtesting has to be thought about from thestart particularly in a micro servicearchitecture there's a lot ofasynchronous communication going on hereand one of the this is an example of amock client the actual method generatingthe mock client and the mock clientsthat we produce in Scala are theycompile and they're fully functional andwhat this really means and because theycome from that same API specification itallows us to do high fidelity fasttesting we can actually write a bunch ofunit tests and integration tests againstthe mocks and have confidence that thosetests that we wrote are sufficient toprove that things are going to workcorrectly in production mocking is never100% and so there's other techniquesthat complement this to get to thatfinal you never get to 100% confidencepretty close in practice I would say inthree years I can think of two bugs thatmade it to production where thatcouldn't be caught by mocks and they hadto do with Network things likeauthentication being a little bitdifferent on one particular resource sowe do this for everything generateeverything from the spec now we have agood way to go and test everything greatso now let's talk about we're actuallyready to write some code we'redevelopers like to write some code sohere's what code looks like get flow sothis is the actual implementation of thepost method user Dao create we'll talkabout the Dao in a bit and basicallyI've got a user from the request requestbody as user form there comes back aboutAsian errors or I've created user and wejust case I can serialize to JSONthis is what all basically all ourcontrollers that flow look like thisit's the same thing over and over againvalidate and create and so now let'stalk about well first I mean that'spretty bad Scotty that's beautiful codesimple to read and that's what we wantwrite the code that we're actuallywriting as developers we make it assimple as possible and there's evenfewer bugs that we're gonna catch in ourtests let's talk about this users nowand a little bit about databasearchitecture first each micro serviceapplication owns its own database so theway we run this is every if you need adatabase you get a database and thatdatabase belongs to the service no otherservice is allowed to connect to thatdatabase it is private like the databaseis not part of a micro servicesinterface it is private every otherservice and communicates with theservice either through the API orthrough events and this is reallyimportant because once you let peopleto your database connect your databasethrough JDBC you lose the ability toknow if it changes safe just lose itand that turns into actually annp-complete problem over time you willnot be able to prove if you can make achange in the database and that'susually frustrating we talk about techdebt and all these different variationsthis is a very insidious form of techdebt so the solution is just don't letanybody in it's yours it's not part ofthe interface it works if we have agreat API and if we publish the rightevent because everybody else will beable to continue and do the things thatthey need how do you create a databasewell this is how you create database devRDS we're running on RDS and Amazon -app tests and you get your defaultsettings it's gonna be called test DBthese are our default settings you canchange them if you want but theimportant thing here in terms ofinvestment in tooling is we have asingle CLI that we call dev intended fordevelopers and that's what alldevelopers use for all their common allof our common infrastructure anddevelopment tests it's one thing I wantto know how to do something don't knowwhere it is first thing you do is youtry enter and you get a menu of a bunchof stuff that people before you havedone that is now automated in thisconsistent way this is super importanthas to be the same one of the things Ilove they tell you I'll share thisanyway I love logging into Amazon whichof course nobody has to do on a dailybasis cuz everything's automated andthen just looking at our database namesand they all follow the exact samenaming convention everything is the sameeverything is automatedbut it's only automated because somebodytook the time to invest and make the CLIso that the experts in database do itonce and everybody else just benefitsfrom their work we don't need everyoneto be an expert in every piece oftechnology great so now let's actuallyuse the database we're talking aboutcode generation we like code generationso why don't we try to describe ourdatabase needs in metadata and codegenerate our way to a solutionso first we'll describe our scholarrequirements here the package name isgoing to be DB generated ID generatorthis is just a flow thing and how wegenerate unique IDs this one will startwith the be fix USR for user now we'lldescribe our storage requirements in apiece equal attribute we'll say theprimary key is a field named ID and ourwe would like to create an index on thefield name email we then wrote a codegenerator that takes this metadata andactually creates the table definitionthey did accessand it's important to note that eventhough we're using the same tool chainfor capturing the metadata and forwriting the code generators this has wehave divorced our storage needs from ourAPI right those are two different thingswhat does the table look like here's anexample of the code generation thatproduces a table and I think there'snothing fancy here but there's a fewreally interesting things one Ipersonally hate debugging the differencebetween null and empty string and anExcel report I don't know how many ofyou have done that I hate it and so fromthe beginning we came up with aconvention that we're not going to allowthat at flow and we have theseconstraints in Postgresutil non-empty trim string ID and if youtry to insert an empty string you'regetting it an error and we're nevergoing to have this we're gonna have goodclean data from the beginning becausewe're using cogeneration this is howeverything is we have the ability toenforce a policy like this across thecompany I think maybe more interestingis there's this thing called hash codeat the end of the table actually thiscame from a conversation my colleaguemet here at the beginning as we startedupdating our records a lot we keptgenerating all this load on the databasethen many of the updates are actuallythe same right clients just took theircatalog ecommerce catalog and sent us aproduct catalog every day and some ofour clients and that's their wholecatalog every hour not much changesevery hour and so what we did is weimplemented a global solution thatsimply computes the hash code of whatwe're about to do and we only actuallyupdate the record in the database thatthe hash code changed that feature isavailable for every single table at flowacross every single micro service anddevelopers don't have to think about itbecause we have the point of leverage ofmetadata and the code generation that wecould do that and that's a really reallypowerful thing we probably have saved100x rights on our databases and wecould do it globally because we've hadthe discipline to use metadata and notwant which the word this is not acreating and defining your databasetable is not a area where at flow wevalue creativity right this is a knownproblem we just need to get the workdone what are the scholar classes looklike same thing big thing here is just anormalized access to the databases andspecifically one small thing to pick outbecause we documented that the emailcolumn has an index there on the findall method how do you even get acollection of objects you'll see that wecan filter by an email or filter by thepresence of an email house email emailthis is driven by the fact that there'sanindex there and the only reason Ihighlight this is because I feel like inindustry there's a lot of people who sayoh my gosh things are slow I got to fixit I created an index I'm a hero thingsare fast againno the hero is the person who preventsyou from ever having that problem beforethey're the unsung hero and to do thatyou have to think about this in advanceand one way to do that is to make surethat your data access layer is triggeredto what you're actually indexing forretrieval and that will happen is thedeveloper will go in and say I need tofind a user by email and there won't bea find by email method and guess what Imay want to put an index on that and wecatch it at the beginning of the designprocess and drive quality through theentire infrastructure great testing sohere's an example of how to create aninstance of our mock client for testingso this is we're getting a new client inplay they use dependency injection so wegrab an instance of WS clients for theplay thing the URL localhost dollar portdollar port is where our integrationtest is running and here we put two offheaders this identify as a user prettybasic stuff but what this enables isreal tests that look like this so theget user by ID method that we startedwith at the beginning this is an entireintegration test end to end running withall the mock clients like from thegenerated code I create a user and now await it's a future users get by ID and Ibetter get back the user I expected andthen the second test case if I get auser by random ID I better get back aknock down to 404 that's it this is areal test and this is using actuallyusing the mock client actually making aninternal HTTP request within the playframework and we're testing end to endand I will tell you these tests workbecause when we write tests like thiswe don't we never find discrepancies inproduction or said another way of thisover the past few years through all ofthis focus on testing and reallyleveraging the specification I've cometo a point where I expect our teamexpects that as code moves to productionit just works you're not surprised we'llverify it and it just works over andover and over again and that drivesquality that drives team velocity greatso we've written our service wrote ourreally beautiful code tested it time todeploy so let's talk quickly aboutdeployment continuous delivery is aprerequisite to managing micro servicearchitectures you can quote me it isabsolutely essential if your team isspending hours babysitting releases andyou have 100 microservices good luckyou're going to be spending your timedeploying your services it just does itwill just bottleneck you ediot when wemove down the path from monolith andstarted to distribute this was the firstbig investment guilt made into adelivery system to deploy software andit was an excellent decision it probablytook us nine months to get to a pointwhere it was reliable but definitely theright first decision continuous deliverymeans a ton of things what we mean isthat a deploy is triggered by a get tagwe like it we use git to deploy youcreated tag and then tag gets deployedand then in addition the continuous partis we automatically create tags wheneverthere's a change on master that actuallytriggers a system time I created tag andtag automatically does a bunch of stufflike go create a docker image go set thedesired state principles of a continuousdelivery system or metrics 100%automated and 100% reliablerarely rarely do systems behave that wayright and so red flag is if deploys keepfailing and you're finding developershaving to log into lots of systems todebug why deploy failed all that time iswasted and that needs to be fixed to getback the velocity across the platformhere's our our dashboard what it lookslike so micro services when they werelast deployed a deployed just sets thedesired state to the latest tag andwhite means nothing's going on andhere's what it looks like I should saywe use a really an open source projectthat we created in a week and a half atthe beginning of flow called Delta letme say that again our entire continuousdelivery system that deploys softwarethousands of times a week we wrote in aweek and a half one person that's itdon't need a massive investment thisisn't a insanely large project you justhave to really focus on what you'redelivering and what you're delivering isa reliable pipeline to deploy softwareinto the cloud I mean all these toolsexist you're just doing a little bit ofplumbing to connect them so if you'reinterested that's Delta here's what itlooks like when Delta says when youchange something and get github sends awebhook Delta says oh look somethingto my project what's the head of masteroh they had a master of something newcreated tag I got a new tag I'm gonnaset the desired state of my project inthe new version so from 54 to 55 hereand then just monitor just pulseit's my daugher image ready great mydocument is ready Hey ECS gooddiplomatdarker image and it just monitors that'sit it doesn't do anything fancy rightconfiguration so I will say I wouldspeak for everyoneI don't like describing myinfrastructure needs with 10,000 linesof JSON I don't understand it I don'tknow what security groups are I don'tknow what VPNs are I'm a softwaredeveloper right in that role and so Ithink when the key things for microservices infrastructure is really reallyto try to get it down to the most basicelements and let the people whounderstand infrastructure make theserecommendations for the company and thisis what our configuration looks like fordeploying stuff it's six lines of the MLand if you needed a bigger instance myguess is everyone here could figure outhow to do it and that's what we wantright self-documentinganother key thing that we see we do andwe see all over the place is standardizehealth checks and ours wrote on internalhealth check it's just a standard URLthat's well known every serviceimplements this how do they implementthis they pull in the specification ofthe health check from the API specbecause how else would you expose anendpoint right and so here you see asimple model called health check whichjust has status we say healthy whenhealthy otherwise we describe theproblem 200 healthy means good for 22text means bad and this is reallyimportant I mean just a critical elementbut just to institutionalize some typeof health check into all the microservices even if at the beginning isjust returning at 200 at least you'vegot the placeholder to add checks in thefuture things that services do make surethey have access to their database makesure that any environment variables areactually available in production andwhat this allows us to do is during adeploy if any of that isn't ready thatinstance just fails to become healthyand it's never put into traffic and thenwe can go debug whatever happened at thedeploy and do that on our own time asopposed to having an issue in productionand now it's time to talk about eventsso the way I like to describe our API isthat flow or credibly proud of them youeverything we do is API first it'sbeautiful as well documentthey're simple they're consistentperfectly happy if we never use ourapi's we'd prefer you to use our eventsrooms instead and more than that our owninternal network we don't want to useour api's at allthere are a few rare examples where youreally really need synchronousoperations and in those instances wewill make API calls for everything elseour own services just consume events andprocess everything asynchronously and Ithink we've been in a lot of talks onthis particularly I think this year evenmore momentum around this sort ofapproach and it it really really worksbut requires again an investment to makethe tooling right so let's talk firstabout a few principles of an eventinterface first-class schema for allevents you have to have events inwell-defined schema everyone who's usingbinary formats like G RPC is in greatshape everyone who's using things likeswagger is in terrible shape the bigdifference there is binary formatsforced developers to use thecogeneration to produce and consumeevents which is a good way ofguaranteeing that the schema is in factcorrect and regardless of the toolingthat's used that correctness for theevents in the API is is criticalcritical critical to make sure it istrue if you find an example in theorganization where behavior andproduction differs from the declaredspec in my opinion that's like theToyota Kaizen process you pull the alarmeverybody stops and you fix the processso that can never happen again becauseof developers lose trust in thespecification it turns into anincredibly huge bottleneck in softwaredevelopment all of our producersguarantee at least once delivery all ofour consumers must assume multideliveries and therefore have toimplement idempotency right there's thesemantics which we chose I think todayquite common it worksputs a little bit more emphasis on theconsumers to make sure that theyimplement idempotency but keeps thesystem quite reliable and just a fewmetrics we're built on top of Kinesiswhich has some inherent latency on itbut end-to-end single event latency atFlo is about half a second right so thisis from time database record createdpublished to Kinesis consumed on theother side and some action taken on itwhich for almost everything that we dois plenty and the things that need to befaster end up being eitheractually we've never had to do anythingbastard we just need those few things incuriously and our systems based onPostgres we'll walk through how we do itwe emphasize a simple system that waseasy to debug and frankly low-tech andwe'll walk through but it still isscaling to about a billion events perday per service which again for many usecases by far I think the majority usecases that many of us interact with on adaily basis is plenty so here's how wedo it so on the producers we create ajournal of all operations on the tablethe journal basically de stores everyinsert update delete along with theoperation on that table so we have acomplete history of everything that everhappened and so in the users table youcan think of the record in the userstable as the current view of that userrecord and then behind it there will bea journal users table which has everysingle operation when we insert into thejournal table we queue that journalrecord to be published real-timeasynchronously we publish one event perjournal record right insert into usersinsert into journal users insert into acue that there is a journal record topublish notify we use actors notify anactor that something has changed actorcomes in gets a bunch of work andpublishes them to Kinesis replay becomesquite simple because you can either justriku the record or frankly whatdevelopers do is just update the updateuser set ID close ID or ID is five andit just goes through the chain again andthat user gets publishedso replay becomes quite simple on theconsumer side consumers read off ofKinesis get a batch of records theyactually insert them into a localdatabase into their local database inbasically temporary storage it ispartitioned for pass removal on eventarrival we just queue that there's anevent to be consumed send a message toan actor that something new has come inand then we do this in micro batches bydefault every 250 milliseconds we grab abatch of all the new events and thenprocess them in the app any failures arerecorded locally and published to amonitoring system so that you youactually see we will receivenotifications if there are kind of ifyou see any build up in failure queuesand then operationally we work so thatthere are no failureand failures are treated first-classit's not a product usually not aproduction issue but within hours getslooked at resolved and often thesolution is either a bug fix or a replayor somethingI think visibility on errors is superimportant right and by having a localcopy of the event in the consumer onceyou fix the bug that caused the error tohappen in the first place you justregret to be processedyou don't have to leave you don't haveto go back to Kinesis you don't have togo back to the producer because you havea local copy of your event you fix theproblem you actually have all the dataas it's really easy to write a test casefor it fix the problem and then justriku the record to be processed this ishow we define our event schemas again welike to use the same we like one toolfor everything less to learn and we usethe same tool in this case API builderto define our events so the way thisworks is we define one model per eventin this case four users we have twoevents one called user absurd it sousers insert it an insert or an updateon a user and the second called userdeleted where a user was deleted thoseare the two models we group models intoUnion types and so an event types willgo into a single Union type in this casethe Union type is called user underscoreevent by convention the first part isthe name of the microservice user thesecond part is the word event ourconvention is important because we havea linter that will go through on eventsright and then we can say that everyUnion type maps to a single stream inKinesis and this is nice because now wecan control you know if we have a veryhigh velocity event very easy to justgive it a dedicated stream but generallythe common case is that a stream 8 8micro service will publish will have oneUnion type that's published in onestream for others to consume streams areowned by exactly one service so if thereis a user event it can only be publishedby a single micro service that way youcan go back to the source and again mostservices define exactly one streamhere's an example of what a linter lookslike for events so one of the things wedo is every event must have a fieldcalled timestamp it must be in thedocumentation the second field the thirdfield if we're SAS platform we identifyour customers by a field calledorganization so if this is a model thatis organization specific that therefield will be the word organization ifthe model has a field called number forexample that will be the fourth fieldand so really pedantic stuff but at theend of the day all of our events lookthe same you can see them at a userevent you can probably guess what acompany event looks like you'll have theexact same structure and that againsuper important and actually enableswhen you have this kind of consistencyit really enables you to do interestingthings like consistently Drive and dropyour events into a data warehouse forexample you can actually do thatprogrammatically because you haveconsistencywhat's the database look like talk aboutjournaling we have metadata thatdescribes our storage requirements thisis a nice storage requirement we'll calla journal and Journal has two attributeshow long and how frequent so this onewe're going to journal data for threedays what this actually does in thedatabase is create partitions that aredaily and on day four we'll drop the oldpartition from four days ago we use acouple of libraries one is a churninglibrary for Postgres written by ryanmartin from guilt and second is we usepartition managers I think is from Keithat Omni ti but a great library forpartitioning on Postgres and I know he'soptimistic that finally we're gonna getnative partitioning I know we havenative partitioning posters ten and Ithink by 11:00 we're hopeful that thefeature set that we need will becomenative but that's it all the developerhas to do is declare the retentionpolicy and these journalists are createdfor them now we'll go to app code how dowe actually publish first thing we needto do is get a stream how do you get astream we have a library for ventingthat frankly we invested a lot of timeto build so that the developerexperience of working with events waseasy and simple so here's an example Qis our internal library I'm going to beproducing user events Q dot producertype tag user event and you'll seenowhere in here you're going to see thestream name like why should somebodyhave to write a stream name they don'tcare we can use reflection and figureout what stream we should be publishingto and just make sure it's consistent inthis stream name you'll notice on at theend this is so in cases where we likeJSON because it works everywhere but incases where you actually need anaari format you can switch that andpublish it a stream where essentially weembed the content type in the name ofthe stream stream this is the actualcode to produce an event takes aninstance of a user version the userversion maps to a record from thejournal table all of that again is codegenerated developers don't have to worryabout that what a developer has to worryabout is actually publishing the eventthat they want and this is exactly whatthey dogiven a version of a user I'm gonna goahead and publish if it was an insertupdate publish and up started otherwisepublish a deleted and interestinglybecause we've Co generated theinterfaces to this data what happens isall of our app code starts to look thesame right and now when we think aboutan unspoken benefit is any one of thedevelopers on the back-end team canactually drop in to any one of the othermicro services and be productive yesthey need to have a domain knowledge andcontacts and all that but it all behavesthe same right and so the learning curveas team shipped around and people movearound really goes away and we can againstay focus on building product testingtesting is super important this is anactual test that goes end-to-end onpublishing an event on user creation sowe create a user and then eventually ourstream must contain an event of typeuser absurd where the ID email and nameactually use a recreated end-to-end testthat's it and again we've invested a lotof time in the library run streaming sothat when this test passes locally itworks in production and the onlydifference in production is instead ofan in-memory queue or now we now havenetwork in Kinesis right but from aninterface perspective for all of us asdevelopers it doesn't matter - Ella Ttesting and similarly in the consumerside this is what it looks like youreceive a user event payload as JSONcast it to a user event and then we canpattern match and just store a copy ofthe event and we do this quite a bit wereally publish events and then if if Ineed to operate on users I keep my owncopy of users locally and then interactwith that data theresimilarly testing on the consumer sideagain we spent a lot of time here makingsure that it's simple to write testinvestment to make it simple to writetest factories make userupp sortedfactories you can probably guess wascode generated based on the API spec andgives us an instance of the userabsurdity vent I can publish it to mymock stream and then in a fewmilliseconds we'll see that back up sortof my local database and so again I canjust go check my database so this is anend-to-end test event published myconsumer picked it up and shortlythereafter stored a copy in my localdatabase and I can keep building on thiscritically critically important so nowour service is in production it'sworking we have a database we can createusers everything is great we're doneright now dependencies this is wherethings get really interesting there's adecision to make in micro services topaint the to broad extremes one extremeis once it's deployed you never touch itthen factor in if you need to make animprovement you might as well rewrite itor on the flip side you can decide topay a tax as you go and just keep yourdependencies up to date we've chosen topay that tax and our goal really independency management is to be able toautomatically update all of our servicesto the latest dependencies and this is Ithink this is the right thing to do it'sdebatable because there's a tax you payas you go but it means that if there's acritical security update in a library wecan get it out to all our services andours if we have a critical bug fix inour core leverage and get it out inhours and it should take hours not weeksor months and interestingly we thought alot about making sure that the processwe use for the software that we developinternally was the same as the processwe use for all our open source librariesit's the same it's just code I don'tcare if I know the author personally orwe sit at the same table it's at the endof the day it's just a library it's justcode we should have the same processwhether we're together or a part edflowed process wise we upgrade ourservices generally at least once a weekour process is once a week but I thinkthis week we did it twice in fact we didthis morning about 10:30 a.m. it wasdone at 11:30 and so we've reallyinvested in the tooling here and I thinkthis is one of the best things thatwe've done and I honestly have and Idon't see this much in industry myselfthis is dependency that floated IO is anopen source project that we built earlyon in the days of flow and what it doesis you add you connect to github and youadd a project it then crawls yourproject and extracts all thedependencies automatically yourlibraries your biit then crawls all the resolvers allover the world and keeps track of everylibrary in every version of everylibrary and then is able to turn thatinto an event stream back to you thehuman to say hey this project I havesome recommendations for you for my userproject you're using live validationzero zero seventeen I would like tosuggest that you upgrade to zero zeroeighteen and there is a crazy if you'reinto this stuff there's a crazy versiontag parser built on scala parserCombinator's if you're into that sort ofthing and it friggin works so there areno false positives which is what drivesthe cut of the quality of the automationif you're into Scala it's actually was across build aware and so if you're oncall at 10:00 you're not gonna get arecommendation to upgrade to a 2:11library that sort of thing biginvestment but it's worth it becauseonce a week we can type this this scriptwritten in Scala ammonite scriptsupgrade upgrade SC it reaches out to thedependency REST API it has its own RESTAPI of course comes back with a list ofrecommendations for all our projectsupgrades our dependencies and thencreates a pull request right so whenthis happens actually funny story youknow there's services that tell you whoand your team is productive based onanalyzing get usage we had them analyzeus and we were monsters in their systembecause of all these pull requests thatwe were submitting to guilt to get on aweekly basis it's amazing contributionhistory but this is it you run onecommand and we have PRS for everythingand because we've spent so much time onour testing the policy is once it'sgreen we deploy that's it right and nowwe can do that every single week and allof our applications are running on thelatest versions of every piece ofsoftware and we just nurture them andfeed them every single week so insummary just to really just focus in onkind of three critical decisions I thinkthe first one is really to design yourschema first for all of your api's andevents and in there to really focus onconsuming the events not the API havethe API but by all means if you can usethe events use the events you're goingto get so many benefits second is a highlevel of investment in automation acrossthe board this is really importantwhether it's the code generators thedeployment system that a tendancymanagement a real real investment inautomation and when we think aboutpolyglot and micro serverin different languages this is where wehave to be really careful because everylanguage every framework that we chooseto add into our infrastructure all ofthose things that we just saw that allowus to be efficient in delivering ourmicro services now need to be built totake into account that new language andthat new framework and it's a I meanfrankly it's a huge investment hugeinvestment and I think that's what needsto be considered which is why I thinkwhen we look at you know 4,000 employeesper engineers per language it's likehaving the resources and the time tomake it a priority to invest isabsolutely critical to being able to dothis successfully and third I thinkthere's this focus on enabling teams towrite amazing and simple tests drivequality streamline maintenance enablecontinuous delivery imagine if youdidn't trust your tests and you want toupgrade your dependencies what are yougoing to do how are you going to verifywhat's you know how much time is itactually going to take before you feelconfident to deploy yesterday and wetell the story about testing soyesterday I was on an airplane and as Ilike to do on an airplane I'm writingtests and I'm writing tests againstproduction because that is a really goodway to build quality software and inthis case this was a bug that wasreported by a user and I say well it'scomplicated bug involves lots ofservices some orchestration I'm gonnajust write a test that sets upeverything in production and I got tothe end and actually the test passedit's like frustrated because I thoughtoh there was a bug and there was no bugwe now published that test now runsevery single day it's a cron job that'srunning his production this morning aslight variation was reported I said ahawe have the framework wrote the test todemonstrate the bug in production andyes there was a bug and I think I'd liketo call it TDD in production wrote thetest the test is failing againstproduction have now been able to go intothe micro Service replicate the testreplicate the bug in the micro servicewrite the unit tests in the microservice that unit that micro service isgetting deployed and when that deployfinishes we can now go run theproduction test and verify that theproduction test now passes so TDD inproduction and it feels so amazing to beable to do that and at the end of theday it's one of those critical elementsthat goes overlooked how can we reallyget to the point where we're soconfident in our tests that we can doall of these other things and automatethe maintenance so that we can actuallyget the benefits of these architecturesbecause there are a lot of benefitswithout paralyzing our teams at the endof the dayso thank you very much go forth anddesign micro-service architecture is theright wayand I think we may have time for one ortwo questions and Happy's to stay afteras wellyes sir there's a microphone next to youthank you very muchhow do you how do you balance newfeatures that aren't ready yet and acontinuous employment right do you havebranches do you have a separate dataenvironments how do you handle that yeahit's a great question how do we managefeatures at different stages ofdevelopmentso my I'll talk personally I can't go tosleep if I have an open PR I can't Idon't want to and I don't and soeverything that I do in my life isoptimized so that however much time Ihave when I'm done it's in productionhe's not in production I have to worryabout it and what that means in practiceis if we're working on a larger featureyou've got to decompose and every daywe're deploying and it's dark it's darkit's dark it's dark it's dark it's darkit's dark now we can get to a pointwhere we have a feature flag where wecan enable it and start to verify butit's always in production all the timenon-stop and I think that's frankly Ithink it's the best way to do it itdepends on continuous delivery itdepends on a great system of testing tomake sure that you have that confidencethat you're actually not breakinganything but boy is it nice to go tosleep knowing that everything is workingand there's no outstanding work to dogreat question I think we're time allright we're at time so happy to takeyour questions after and thank you verymuch[Applause]",
    "summary": "This YouTube video \"Design Microservice Architectures the Right Way\" details a practical approach to building and managing microservices, emphasizing the importance of careful planning, automation, and a strong focus on testing to avoid the common pitfalls of spaghetti architecture and \"future paralysis.\" The speaker shares lessons learned from his experiences at Gilt and his current company, Flocommerce, advocating for an API-first design, where API definitions are treated as first-class citizens and are language-neutral. He dispels misconceptions surrounding microservices, such as the idea that teams should use different languages for each service or that code generation is inherently evil, instead stressing the importance of consistency and tooling to streamline development.\n\nThe video highlights the benefits of using code generation to create routes, client libraries, and mock clients directly from API specifications, ensuring consistency across services and simplifying testing. He advocates for a continuous delivery pipeline where deployments are triggered by Git tags, and stresses the importance of standardized health checks and dependency management. The speaker also delves into event-driven architecture, explaining how Flocommerce leverages events for asynchronous communication between services, using a journal of operations on each table to create a complete history of changes, and emphasizing the need for well-defined event schemas and idempotent consumers. The end goal is to empower teams to write simple tests, drive quality, streamline maintenance, and enable continuous delivery, leading to a more agile and efficient development process."

    "transcript": "hi everyone this is gkcs in this videowe'll be talking about 20 white papersthat you must know as a back-endengineer especially if you are in asenior engineering position or stafflevel position the benefit of reading awhite paper is that you get to know theimplementation details and the Practicalaspects of Building Systems so most ofthe trade-offs that are chosen whenbuilding a system come from the productrequirements of the system in the caseof these white papers the productrequirements are being decided by otherEngineers who will be using that systemfor example you have the system at metawhich is called memcached like it's anopen source software which Facebook hasmodified for their own use one of theproblems they're facing was scaling sothey need to deploy many nodes of mapcachechallenges of routing routing one thingwhich came up was should you choosesharding over redundancy shardingbasically means you have a key space andthat key space is divided into sets eachset is given to a set of servers andredundancy means that you have the samekey space being handled by multipleservers simultaneously the problem herewith multiple servers is that they maybe eventually consistent and also thecost of managing multiple servers for asmall key space as you see this problemis not as big as the other problem ofstarting for Facebook because they had aconcept of aggregate queries so when aclient request would come for let's saythe profile the profile also had friendconnections it also had likes on a posta news feed so it was a complex queryhitting multiple shards and so splittingthe key space would have only madethings worse for them so this is anexample of one trade-off each of thepapers that I'm really talking about arereally interesting and you should have alook so let's start number 20 monoliththis is a real-time recommendationsystem white paper this is from TickTock their Engineers have found a way togive recommendations to millions ofusers in real time so one of theproblems with any recommendationalgorithm is you have a set of users youhave a real-time component to it and abatch component to it but therecommendations in the real-time sectionare not very good model that found a wayto embed features of users right thebasic idea here would be that gauravlikes to watch let's say chess videosand a person who likes to watch chessvideos may also like to program so anembedding can be thought of as a pointin a n-dimensional space gaurav has aparticular age so that is the x-axisgaurav is a male that's a y-axis gauravis from India that's on the z-axis likeI said he likes watching chess videos soprobably you're watching chess videomaybe a alpha axis and so on you have ndimensions in this gaurav is a point andpeople who are close to him usually tendto watch the same things how do youefficiently embed gaurav in a space andalso give him recommendations is aserious problem in many of these uselessnews feedapplications so as an engineer it makessense to look at the kind of scale thatyou're dealing with 19 flexi raft thisis a paper by meta it's a veryinteresting paper because when you lookat the raft algorithm you have thisconcept of Quorum where a majority ofthe nodes agree on a particular valuethe problem with this is scalability ifyou you add more and more nodes amajority of those nodes have to agree ona value it's not easy to do and also itdoesn't make sense when you have aglobally distributed system the Indianservers have to agree to the U.Sserver's value maybe the Europe serversalso have to come in so a global systemof Quorum is not what you're looking foryou're looking for a tree like structurewhere the Indian surgery on a particularvalue and they have a leader who talksto the leader of the US who talks to theleader of Europe this tree hierarchyalso needs to be roughly consistent soFacebook has come up with this algorithmcalled flexi raft it's reallyinteresting to look at I think it willalso give you an idea of how raft Worksinternally or if you are really into itpaxos we have discussed that ininterview ready also pretty useful toknow how this good consensus Worksnumber 18 is spanner spanner is alsoaround dispute consensus but it's aroundhow a database can work how it can giveyou strong consistency guarantees how itcan offer transactions and spanner is avery popular example for a Geodistributed database which is stronglyconsistent and also highly availableGoogle has spent millions of dollarsmaking sure that their clocks are all insync and it's a feat of engineeringwhich is worth looking at spanner isexpected to survive the worst of faultseven if things are on fire there's anexpectation that spanner is going to beup so it's good to look at what kind offault all mechanisms Google has employednumber 17 Minesweeper Minesweeper isagain meta it's a root cause analysissystem you can imagine this to besomething which identifies what caused aproblem so you have anomaly detection ifyou have any kind of a smooth graph ifit's a straight line one differentiationwill make it flat if it's a parabola twodifferentiations will make it flat butif it's not if it's a very complex graphwith anomalies three differentiationswill show you all the problem pointsokay and you can catch them and say thatthese are economies once you havedetected these anomalies how do youidentify what caused the anomaly you areprobably going to look at factors whichare highly correlated to the graph thatyou're looking at a change in thecontributing factor is probably what hascaused the final change that you'reseeing in your business Matrix if yousee sales are low but actually what hasreally happened is Landings on thewebsite alone then you should probablyfocus on The Landings instead of tryingto fixMinesweeper is an automated system it'sreally interesting to think about howmuch automation can help you for astartup of course it doesn't really makesense because you can do this manuallybut in medium to large organizations itmakes a lot of sense number 16 CassandraCassandra is an extremely populardatabase it talks about how the databaseuses the cluster architecture the gossipprotocol how it chooses certaintrade-offs like consistency oravailability however Frankly Speakingdid give me Vibes that you know it's anopen source clone of Amazon dynamodbit's totally fine I mean I totallyunderstand open source Technologies arevery important it's important to havethese possible solutions for us smallcompanies to leverage but as a whitepaper yes it probably is not the world'sbest white paper having said that as anengineer it's worth reading number 15Foundation DP Foundation DB is reallyinteresting because the kind of testingtechniques that they have employed tomake sure that their transactions workin this nosql database are novel rightthe stocks also on Foundation DB otherthing is that it's a key value datastore so that's the most popular kind ofdata store when it comes to you know SQLdatabases and it's worth the read whenit comes to highly consistent systemswhich are also scalable and it's a paperby Apple so there's some diversity inthese white papers number 14 AmazonAruba Aurora is more like anarchitecture pattern that Amazon useswhen it comes to managing databases sothe key factors here are scale Amazonwants to scale enormously and they alsowant to give you very high availabilityso how do they ensure that how do theyadd and remove nodes seamlessly how dothey also hide the complexity of Aurorafrom their clients you want to give somesort of customizability but you alsodon't want startups to break their headswhile using your system so it's aninteresting set of trade-offs that theyhave picked up in this paper and it'sdefinitely worth reading number 13tackle brackle is a system by Googlethis is a graph processing system it'snot necessarily maintaining graphs butfinding patch atoms in graphs so pageranking algorithms finding outinteresting websites ranking thosewebsites all of this is usually done inbatch it's a very old system by Googlewhich gives a good idea of how itprobably works behind the scenes onceyou know this you might have a decentidea of how SEO works for Google in factsome of the aspects for the pregnantpeople are very practical so it makessense as an engineer to read this quitewell number 12 Apple Dapper is anothersystem by Google it's a tracing systemif you have a request which is goingthrough possibly hundreds of servicesthen it's very difficult to trace thatrequest to find out what happened atwhat point in time Dapper is probablythe first step when it comes to rootcause analysis for example you probablycan't take all requests you want to dosome sort of sampling of requests youdon't want to log every line of therequest you want some points which whenreached trigger an event and say thatokay this thing happened to this requestokay especially at scale it doesn't makesense to log everything one interestingthing about Dapper is that whenever asystem tries to integrate this serviceengineers at Depot check whether you arehitting it the right way because youshouldn't be impacting the rest of theservices at Google so it's not just codereviews now it's actually inter-systemcode reviews number 11 chubby chubby isa system very similar to Apachezookeeper Google came up with thissystem for disputed locks and that's afundamental component of any kind oftransaction or any kind of leaderelection that you have internally itemploys paxospaper doesn't talk about paxos anymoreinstead it focuses on the Practical asof implementing such a large scaledistributed Locking System for examplewhat do you do you probably use a filesystem to manage the logs you need somesort of notifications to be sentwhenever a lock is held or released ifyou want a high level understanding ofpaxos interview ready has a lesson onthat 10. mega store mega store is a datastore at Google which providesrelational database semantics so Googleusually goes for nosql but Megastore isa highly scalable highly reliable systemwhich gives you asset transactions andalso an rdbms like feel it's interestingto look at what kind of trade-offs theyhave made here again and also howthey've tested the system how they makesure that what they have built actuallyworks in such a large environment what Ifound interesting was that internallyMegastore uses big table which is anosql data store how do you map rdbms toa nosql data store makes you feel likehow databases actually work you have avery simple let's say Hardware system ora file system which is back all of yourdata even in the database so how do youbuild relational data on top ofsomething which doesn't provide you thatright how do you build indexes soMegastore is definitely worth it numbernine big table big table is afundamental database solution for Googleit's a nosql data store it's actuallysomething which Powers many of thesystems in Google including I think thesearch engine you have multiple versionsof the data that can be stored so if youhave an older version of a page and thenyou have a newer version of the page youcan have all of that in one data storecalled bigtable many of the principlesof bigtable like hot shots and keepingmultiple shards consistent is nowconsidered common practice but when itwas made it was a really big deal and ofcourse the ideas are very intelligentit's a very practical database solutionthat Google came up with at a time whennosql was not a very common solutionnumber eight map reduce the map reducearchitecture is one of the mostimportant core architecture pieces thatany data engineer or software engineercan look at as the system scale you havevery Services storing data and this dataneeds to be processed for analyticsreasons recommendations sometimes justfor storage archival how do you do thisefficiently with commodity Hardware morethan a decade ago when Google came upwith a solution of mapreduce it wasextremely normal and very intelligent infact immediately open source Solutionsstarted coming out using this kind of anarchitecture which is absolutely amazingif you have seen Apache spark or ApacheHadoop they end up using mapreduce orsome variation of it internally it's amust tweet for engineers who should knowabout this architecture because some ofthe concepts are in fact now used alsoin programming languages Java has thisconcept of mapping filtering reducingand at interview ready we have explainedthis architecture in detail number eightGoogle file system this is probably theworld's most popular technical whitepaper when it comes to softwareEngineers Google file system is a way inwhich Google stores data it doesn'tnecessarily need to be file databigtable for example uses Google filesystem so it forms a basic layer on topof other high level system and forGoogle I'm sure it makes a lot of senseto build their own file system how dofile system is something you might haveheard of there are tremendoussimilarities when it comes to Hadoop andGoogle Google came out first and I thinkHadoop has taken inspiration again whichis totally again like I said fine youyou need open source Alternatives andsolutions for your own systems but theoriginal paper is very well written uhit's very easily understandable and thetrade-offs which are made to ensure thatthis file system is consistent andperformant makes a lot of sense it's amust read for engineers number six Taut-a-l or Tau from meta is a veryinteresting system which is basically anin-memory graph database for meta itmakes a lot of sense to have anin-memory graph database because theyhave the social network that they wantto pass to map this information youcould use relational databases you coulduse nosql databases you can try to hackyour way through through adjacency listsbut none of them really work at scale soinstead they have a dedicated in-memorygraph database called Tau and some ofthe Practical considerations when itcomes to keeping this data consistentand highly available are absolutelyamazing tau is I think an engineeringMarvel like you should as an engineerdefinitely read up on it number fivememcached memcached is an amazingSolution by Facebook the best part aboutthis is the practicality of theirdecisions I think we touched on thisearlier but there's a ton of oftrade-offs and a ton of optimizationsthat Facebook has made on memcacheshould you use TCP or UDP well itdepends on the situation should you gofor sharding or application like we saidit depends on the situation here theychose the application so there's a tonof trade-offs a ton of practicalapplications that memcache at Facebookhas and the white paper is definitelyworth the review it's probably the topfive papers that you can look at numberfour Monarch Google Monarch is a Timeseries database the reason why I'mmentioning this so high up is becauseMonarch is again a very practicaldatabasesomething that Google uses at scale withvery high reliability to monitor theirsystems Monarch is expected to run evenif all the other systems have gone downincluding their database if the databaseis down Monarch is supposed to say heythe database has gone down now how doyou do that right because to some extentyou are going to be tracking yourpatterns and anomalies through databasegraphs so you have to keep everything inmemory and as a Time series database atGoogle scale that's a ton of memorythat's in petabytes the byte paper isabsolutely amazing it's definitely worththe read number three gorilla DB gorillaDB is not a database it's an in-memorydatabase you can call it a cache andit's a Time series database Facebookagain does something similar to in factyou'll see them come up with the samelogical conclusions both companiesGoogle and Facebook created their owntime series database Monarch and gorillaand then eventually they say that we aregoing to be doing something different soFacebook says the recently timed eventsare the most important ones and Googlesays I'm not going to make thatassumption and because of that they havetrade-offs they make architecturaldecisions which are different right butFacebook for me I I find them reallyinteresting in the sense that they theychoose performance very often theychoose practicality very often for astartup it makes more sense or theyresonate more with me so their whitepaper was a personal preference I thinkMonarch is of course engineering by ismore of a marble I would say but yeahgorilla is definitely both leadingbehind the scenes it uses open tsdp soit kind of cheats on the persistenceside and it's in the top three papersthat I would go for number two Amazondynamodb this is a very popular databaseSolution by Amazon in fact I think itpropelled their engineering Fieldscomplex algorithms like resource levelalgorithms so when it comes to Mercuryto make sure that data is moved from oneplace to another consistent hashing andall of this actually implementeddynamodb has extremely high levels ofavailability it's very performant itsconsistency is also pretty amazing andit's a solution that is offered by AWSto everybody in the world it's one ofthe most impactful papers in the worldso it's worth looking into number onewhat Zanzibar this is a system by Googleit's been open source now the reason I'mmentioning Zanzibar on top as the bestpaper probably that you can read thereare so many practical optimizations madeby Google to make sure that theirauthentication system runs efficientlythe algorithm for authentication youknow the the data schema or the apis isjust hardly one page that's the ideathat this concept then comesoptimization or optimization oroptimization and I'm like reallyimpressed by Google that they made thisopen source that you can actually usethis 90 you probably either won't needit or you can just go to gcp whichprobably uses it internally you don'treally need to build it but the aspectsaround rate limiting the aspects aroundfault tolerance when it comes toZanzibar are absolutely mind-blowingsome of these Concepts I had explainedat interview ready in the rate limitingchapter the first one and then I got tosee that Zanzibar is implementing themin reality and at scale right so it'sinteresting to see how Theory meetspracticality but but when you are atlet's say a billion users makingbillions of requests per day it'sdefinitely worth the read for everyengineer do check it out so that's all Ihave for the white papers that youshould read as a software engineer thepapers are neatly organized and put inone blog post the link is in thedescription do check it out let me knowwhat white papers you like with a shortdescription of why you like it maybe youknow it talks about trade-offspracticality the scale the ease ofunderstanding the paper and if you foundsomething particularly interesting wecan actually have a discussion on themin the comments below until next timeI'll see you bye",
    "summary": "This YouTube video, aimed at senior software engineers, presents a curated list of 20 white papers crucial for understanding the practical aspects and implementation details of building large-scale systems. The core idea is that these papers offer invaluable insights into the trade-offs made during system design, often dictated by product requirements determined by other engineers who are the intended users of these systems. The presenter emphasizes that reading these papers can significantly enhance an engineer's ability to make informed decisions, particularly concerning scalability, consistency, and fault tolerance. The video highlights trade-offs such as sharding vs. redundancy and elaborates on systems like memcached, Flexi Raft, and Spanner, showcasing how different organizations tackle challenges in distributed consensus and database design.\n\nThe video systematically goes through each of the 20 white papers, offering a brief overview of the problem each paper addresses, the solution proposed, and the key takeaways for software engineers. Examples include TikTok's Monolith for real-time recommendations, Meta's Flexi Raft for improved consensus, Google's Spanner for Geo-distributed databases, and various database solutions like Cassandra, FoundationDB, Aurora, BigTable, and DynamoDB. The presenter emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying architectures, testing techniques, and trade-offs involved in these systems.\n\nThe video concludes by highlighting the significance of Google's Zanzibar, an authentication system, as the top paper to read due to its practical optimizations for rate limiting and fault tolerance at a massive scale. The presenter encourages viewers to explore the linked blog post containing the papers and to share their favorite white papers and related insights in the comments, fostering a discussion on the trade-offs, practicality, and scale addressed in these important documents. The overall message is that studying these white papers is essential for senior engineers looking to deepen their understanding of system design and build robust, scalable, and reliable software."

    "transcript": " Hey everyone, today\nwe'd be talking. I'm sorry.Is it fine if I record a video? No,\nno problem. Oh, thank you so much..Usually when you're building a\nsystem and engineering system,there's actually some sort\nof background behind it.We'll be taking a real world\nexample of opening a restaurant.Let's see how that happens.Let's take an example of a pizza\nparlo and we have just one chef.There comes a point though that one chef\ncannot handle all the orders that allthe new customers are bringing in.If you think like a manager,the first thing that you're going to do\nis ask the chef to work harder and youcan pay them more, put in more\nmoney. They give you more output.You want to optimize processes\nand increase throughputusing the same resource. When you\nthink of the chef as a computer,and put this in technical terms,\nit's called vertical scaling.Speaking of optimizing processes,\nyou can do some things beforehand.When you get a order, you don't need\nto actually make the pizza paste.That can be pre-made preparing\nbeforehand at non-peak hours.The reason you want to do this at\nnon-peak hours is because you don't want aregular order to come in and your\nchef being busy making the pizza basissomewhere around 4:00 AM in the night\nis really good because you surely won'thave any pizza orders that time.\nNow that the system is set up,let's make it resilient.Let's say that the chef calls\nsick one day. At this point,your business is in trouble because\nthere won't be any business that day.This person is a single point of failure.So what you can do then is hire a backup\nchef in case the chef doesn't come.You employ them for that day only and\nyou pay them. Of course, in this case,the chance of you losing out on business\nis really low because you have not justone chef, but also the backup.Keep backups and avoid\nsingle points of failure forcomputers. It's something like a master\nslave architecture, the master chef,and you have a slave chef, which is a\nlittle lot to say. So that's what we need.Now, if your business\nkeeps growing every time,then you better make that backup\nchef a full-time chef. In fact,hire more chefs. Let's\nsay instead of one chef,you have now 10 chefs and a few\nin backup. Also, just in case,hire more resources, which\nmaps to horizontal scaling.Horizontal scaling is buying more\nmachines of similar types to get more workdone.Let's say we have three of our chefs\nover here, one, two, and three.They have some specialties.\nHere's a question.You have chefs one and three who are\nexperts at making pizzas and chef two'sexpertise is garlic bread. If you\nhave two types of incoming orders,which is pea and garlic bread,\nhow would you route them?What you can do is randomly assign the\norders. So if you have garlic bread,it can go to chef, to chef one, you\ncan take pizza and send it to chef two,but this is not the most efficient\nway to use your employees.You can build on their strengths and\nroute all garlic bread orders to chef twoand all pizza orders\nto chef one and three.This makes the system a little simpler\nbecause anytime you need to make a changein the recipe for garlic bread,\nyou just need to notify chef Two,anytime you need the status\nof any order on garlic bread,chef two is the person you ask.\nYou can actually make a teamlike a team of chefs over here who\nare specialists in garlic bread.Maybe you just need three chefs over here\nfor garlic bread because the number oforders is going to be a\nlittle less. So for pizzas,you need the remaining seven chefs\ndistributed enter team of three and four.They're good at making pizzas and\nthey're getting all the pizza orders.What you're doing is you're scaling this\nteam at a different rate compared tothese two teams and also\ndividing responsibilities.So we have something called\na microservice architecture.You have all your responsibilities\nwell-defined over here.There's nothing outside your\nbusiness use case that you handle,so that is point number\nfive. At this point,a pizza shop is actually doing really\nwell because it's able to handle allorders within time,and it also has specialists for\neverything which you can scale easily.This business is scalable\nto a large extent,but what if there is an electricity\noutage in this pizza shop?You won't have business that day. What\nif you lose your license for a day?You won't have business that day.So what you want to do is you\nwant to distribute. I mean,you don't wanna put all your eggs in\none basket, not not even in one shop.You wanna buy a separate\nshop in a different place,which can also deliver pizzas.\nMaybe it takes more time.Maybe the number of chefs there is\nlesser, but at least you have a backup.So we take backup to a different\nlevel O here and open a new shop.This is probably the biggest step where\nwe introduce a lot of complexity to thesystem because there sometimes needs to\nbe communication between these shops.You need to be able to\nroute your requests. I mean,you get a request for a pizza.\nYou need to be able to tell that,should I order it to this or\nshould I send the order over here?A distributed system.And one very clear advantage that we can\nhave here is that any orders which arevery close to this, which are local to\nits range, can be served by this shopin a large scale distributed\nsystem. Let's say Facebook,you get requests from all around the\nworld to give quick response times.You need some sort of local servers\neverywhere, and that's what we are doing.We are distributing our system so that\nit's more fault tolerant and also givesquicker response times. Let's say you\nhave the old shops pizza shop one and two,and you have delivery agents\nand you have customers.Every time a customer makes a request,they need to either send it to one or two,but the customer is not going to\nbe taking that responsibility.So you want to send it to somebody else,maybe a central place\nwhich just routes requests,and you don't just want to\nsend these requests randomly.You have a very clear parameter.How much time does it take for the\ncustomer to get the pizza? That's it.That's your parameter. If you\nsend it to pizza shop one,it's a really popular shop.Maybe it takes one hour for it to wait\nin queue plus five minutes to makeplus 10 minutes to deliver from\nPSS one to the customer. Over here,pizza Shop two has a\nreally short wait time.The total time required here\nis one hour five minutes,which is less than the one hour\n15 minutes required over here.So the central authority should\nactually send it over here. So,and as long as it's\ngetting real time updates,it can make intelligent business\ndecisions, which means more money.This thing that route requests in a\nsmart way is called a load balancer,and you can assume why the\nsystem is now fault tolerant,but how do you make it flexible to change?At this point,you can almost tell that the delivery\nagent and the pizza shop have nothing incommon. I mean, it could be a pizza shop,it could be a burger shop\nfor the delivery agent.They just want to deliver their goods\nas quickly as possible to the customer.And similarly,the pizza shop doesn't care whether\nit's a delivery agent or the customerthemselves who come and pick it up.So we are seeing some sort of\nseparation of responsibilities.Instead of having the same managers\nmanaging the pizza shop and the deliveryagents, you want to separate that out.\nIt's called decoupling the system,separating out concerns\nso that you can handleseparate systems more efficiently.Let's say pizza shop one has a faulty\noven, their churning rate goes down.If you have a faulty bike,maybe that particular delivery agent's\norder times increase. So at this point,what you want is you\nwant to log everything.You want to see at what time something\nhappened and what is the next event,and so on and so forth. And also\nyou want to be taking those events,condensing them, finding sense out\nof those events. So that's metrics.The final and most important point\nis to keep your system extensible.As a backend engineer.You don't want to rewrite all this\ncode again and again to serve adifferent purpose. For example,this delivery agent doesn't need to\nknow that they're delivering a pizza.It can be a burger tomorrow. And\nif you think about Amazon earlier,they used to deliver only parcels.And the reason why you can scale out\nyour business is because you want todecouple everything to make sure\nthat your system is extensible.What we have done is\ntaken a business scenario,try to find solutions to all the\nproblems that it came up with,and then just map them into technical\nterms. Now, if you think of these,they are solutions in themselves for\nthe technical counterparts of theseproblems. Finally, we have managed to\nscale our restaurant at a high level.We can now define what kind of problems\nwe face and how we'll be solving them.This is known as high level design.\nThere's a counterpart to this,which is called low level design.\nLet's briefly talk about that,the difference between high level system\ndesign and low level system design.So high level is what we talk\nabout on this channel. You know,deploying on servers figuring out how\ntwo systems will be interacting with eachother.Lowell system design has a lot more to\ndo with how you're actually going to codethis stuff, like making classes, making\nobjects, the functions, the signatures,these things are pretty important\nif you are a senior engineer.And even if you're not, if you want\nto go to the senior engineering level,you need to know about how do you\nwrite efficient and clean code,the load band.So microservice architecture and a\nfew other videos are there in thedescription. And if you want\nnotifications for the future videos,you can hit the subscribe button.\nUntil next time, then I'll see you.",
    "summary": "This YouTube video uses the analogy of scaling a pizza restaurant to explain fundamental concepts in distributed systems design. It starts with a single chef (representing a single server) and demonstrates how to handle increased demand through vertical scaling (optimizing the chef's processes and increasing resources) and horizontal scaling (adding more chefs/servers). The video emphasizes the importance of resilience by having a backup chef to avoid single points of failure.\n\nAs the restaurant grows, the video introduces concepts like load balancing, microservices, and decoupling. Load balancing is illustrated by routing orders to the optimal shop based on factors like wait time and delivery distance. Microservices are explained by assigning specialized teams of chefs to different tasks like pizza or garlic bread, enabling independent scaling and specialized expertise. Decoupling is presented by separating delivery management from kitchen management, allowing each component to evolve independently and handle different types of services, thus providing a flexible system.\n\nThe video then transitions to discussing the logging and metrics for monitoring system health and identifying areas for improvement. The key takeaway is that building a scalable and reliable distributed system involves carefully considering these aspects at a high level, similar to how a restaurant manager would plan for growth. The video distinguishes between high-level design (system architecture, server interaction) and low-level design (coding details, class structure, function signatures), highlighting the importance of both for successful system development. The overall goal is to create an extensible system that can adapt to changing requirements and new business opportunities."

dealingwith money you just can't let ourtransaction go unnoticed and hence totalk about it we have someone who hasdone it at scale Arjun from Razorbackfor folks who don't know Razer paysIndia's biggest payment that makes itsuper simple for businesses to acceptpayments and manage payouts I'mdefinitely oversimplifying it over herebut more importantly from theengineering front they have faced orthey face some of the most interestingchallenges and have built some of themost amazing solutions to cater to themthey are widely known for having astrong engineering culture and a greatengineering work to be really honest itis one of the best out there so beforewe start I'd like to thank the entirerace of 18 for being such a sport andfor joining me in discussing how theyachieve data consistency across theirmicroservices so let's jump right intoit and we'll start with knowing ArjunArjun the stage is all yoursthanks arpit first of all thank you forhaving me here I am Arjun tomar and Iwork in the payments platform team ofcrazy uh I have been with the recipe formore than three years now uh I think Ihave been really fortunate enough to bepart of Razor pay and uh and I think thetiming for me was pretty right when Ijoined Razer pay right it was a timewhere 2018 we started seeing a lot ofgrowth PPI volume and the lot of trafficcoming on the online transactions fromdifferent e-commerce companies from thegaming companies and that's the partwhich I like the most about it and Iable to be the part of the system andsee the growth of Razorback so thatjourney I have seen it right so thejourney which makes me also a good inthe professional design and the anotheranother important part I want tohighlight about Razer pay is the cultureso uh if I want to talk about right uhif you go see our slack channels it'sfull of memes so we have kind of a mainculture we do any kind of announcementit starts with the mean and the kind ofownership that Razer pay provides foreach and every developer or engineerright that's amazing so I think I'vebeen very lucky to be part of crazyyeah absolutely yeah I like it it's it'salways fun to be part of a startup thatis just thriving and you see that phasewhere where it is about to see thathockey stick growth and like like reallyhappy really happy to be having thisconversation with you who has been theredone that let's let's do a deep dive onit okay but obviously uh we know uhRazer plays a big name now you and alarge amount of prevention obviouslywon't reveal any numbers but huge amountof payments and obviously I am also ahappy customer of yours so please be ashort of that and but everything has avery simple beginning right what was aday Zero architecture of Razor pay looklikecool so I think when Razer pay startedserving the traffic right for thepayments uh it was just a paymentGateway and it was initial stage wherewe wanted to ship features fast we wantto do part of those revolution infintech firm and want to be part ofdifferently right so we wanted to buildtraffic we want to serve the traffic wewant to uh be the part of the fintechthat Revolution is happening so at thattime we wanted to build a lean stack andthat lean stack uh that's where westarted looking out into differentlanguages and which is easy for thedevelopers to start learning through itright and just just go and start codingand start releasing the features sothat's where we started using PHP withreliable and uh it was a pretty leanstack and we were using AWS for ourdeployments and was using the Route 53micro you do a service for hosting thedomain over there and getting trafficand uh then there was a ALB and then theother half was attached to our monolithservice so it was a militaryarchitecture that for day Zeroarchitecture and we were using MySQLaudio instance for our position instancelayerso MySQL rdis PHP larval and basic AWSTech pretty pretty like pretty hyperoptimized for quick feature deliverypretty interesting and and and to behonest most companies and uh mostcompanies start with with a very similararchitecture because they don't know ifthey are even going to survive or not sothey just keep it simple let's shiftfeatures we'll solve things later likelike that's that's a kind of go getattitude that we need when when when weare working at startups brilliant sowith this you you spoke about having amonolithic database and that is where uhbut still when we are building somethingfor the payments ecosystem it is highlyimportant to ensure consistency of databecause there is it's payment you justcan't have amount deducted from a butnot getting credited to B you can't justmiss on transaction so how did youachieve uh like like what were the keyfactors that you thought about when youwant to to achieve High data consistencyor rather if I may put it strongconsistency of data when you were inthat stage when your database wasmonolithic where everything was there inone daycorrect uh so I I think you got tocorrect right so if if you're working inthe payment system you have to make sureyour data is consistent enough rightbecause you don't you you want the trustof the customers because your initialdays you have you want to have a trustof the customers you also want to showthe traffic you also be the part of theRevelation is of the fintech firm rightso that's where we also chosen the MySQLso we we want the asset compliantdatabase and that's where we startedchoosing MySQL as a database rightbecause that provides High consistencyright and since it was a MySQL RDS inthe initial Days of our architecture uhwe we were having this foreign keyconstraints and the unique constraintsall over the database tables uh whichwas providing the correctness right uhthat was our first main so to providecorrectness we wanted to have this kindof constraints on a database itself butwhen we start uh developing more andmore features we actually analyzed theseforeign key constraints were actuallypulling us backokay and uh the reason behind it howyour foreign key constraint works rightso basically uh when you do update queryor you do a delete query on any any kindof query over there uh it takes a lot ofload on database you're doing an insertit takes a lot of load on database andit actually gives the right stalls andincrease the latencies and whatever thebackground process is happening on mySQL database also takes a hit so that'swhere we moved are all the constraintsto our application logic and we builtsuch custom orm where all theconstraints have been put over theresince it is a mono database and we wereusing laravel as an as a language of PHPuh it provides such custom orm so we canwrite our Rich validation layer to uhfor any query that we are buildingso that was the first initial thoughtand we were using for the consistencyover therepretty interesting you you covered somereally interesting part first part whereyou spoke about uh you had a bunch ofconstraints you spoke about foreign butyou also added the part that foreign keyconstraints slows things down and thisis something that most most Engineers orother most companies if if I may want toexaggerate on that part they don'treally think we we keep on addingforeign key checks everywhere possiblelike that's how we are taught to designgood database schema but that's reallyinteresting that when we operate atscale and as you very tightly said thatwhen you started seeing that high amountof traction foreign key constraint waspulling you all down and this is socounterintuitive to the approaches thatwe typically observe we just like doingwe need strong consistency but now thatyou spoke about it you remove foreignkey checks but then you still need toensure consistency because foreignyou added it to application code sowhich means that uh all of the foreignso you dropped all the foreign keyconstraints is itso now we dropped in from all the eachemitters no consents at a database yeahto our applicationapplication which means everything wouldbe running on a transaction in yourapplication side and there all thesechecks are checkedso you can imagine right uh let's takeabout example uh how foreign key worksbasically uh if if your parent is dependlike payment entities dependent orderentity uh the payment order should bepresent in your table until unless youcannot insert the payment entity rightthat's how funky works now those checksthose validation we have provided intoour application in a customer so that'show we have done it so we have writtenour own repository managers own repofunctions and and built all thoserelation layer into applicationbefore so much of cool engineering stuffhappening behind the scenes God we'dhave to build so much of stuff to ensurethat but yeah you have to do it likelike there is no way there's no way outbrilliant so I I've also heard about avery interesting uh uh uh a veryinteresting constraint called checkconstraint uh have you have you by anychance used it uh somewherea check consent is typically used whereI've seen a bunch of architectures orrather a bunch of database designs wherepeople want to ensure some sort ofcustom constraints on the values thatyou insert on the table it's not foreignkey but it's values that you insert onbasically what kind of values are youallowing to be inserted so for examplefor some reason cannot have valuebetween minus five to plus hypotheticalexample but if you want to add that youcan use check and state so I've seen abunch of uh designs where they have usedit so I thought maybe their paymentsmaybe you works also used it so justjust easily taking a shot in the darkthat's right so all those things rightall those things were put a part of thevalidation layer so let's say you'rebuilding an entity in your laravel andthose entity has those validators rightand those validation validators willtake care of all the check andstraightening constraints before allconstraints everyone's part of the olivevalidations so you can actually Definethis column length has to be from 125 to126. so those all things are part ofyour application logic right now so allof the so so you have checked constructslike you have basically mimic checkconstants but everything on theapplication inside God must be so hugeI bet I bet no but no but that that hasto be there to ensure a strongconsistency that is nowhere yeah yeahokay but yeah we always see like we allstart with monolith but obviously therecomes one day one daythis is what I don't want anymorebecause our company cannot skill withmonolith what was that day like what wasthe day when you um decided okay now Ihave to go to microservices what how howwas it all aboutum I I I believe that's going to bewhere I joined Razer pay in 2019 rightuh that was the year basically uh whenwe started getting a lot of traffic fromthis events called IPL so for for peoplewho's enjoying the minute match isbasically the fourth or four out ofmatch of IPL but what happens in justbefore the match of 30 minutes it wasRazer has to look at all the graphs anddo the stuff over there right uh that'swhere in 2019 we started getting trafficfrom food gaming like zomato uh swiggyjust before the match and and dream 11my 11 Circle we all got the traffic fromthere so what we've seen at that time uhbecause we're getting a burst of trafficfrom multiple Merchants right now whatwas happening since uh this our MySQLhas a limit of database connectionsright now our PHP application wasrunning on top of your Apache web serverso how Apache web server works isbasically until unless your request isterminated it does not reach theresources okay and your PHP does nothave connection poolingright so now what is happening uh whenthe burst of traffic is coming to raisea pay uh it was not raising theconnection and you know the bankecosystem right they sometimes take alot of time and in 2019 it was they werealso building some like to serve thetraffic they were also evolving so uhwhat happened that time uh our databaseconnection limits start hitting okay weare seeing a lot of idle connections andand uh that's where uh we started seeingthe failure so in 2019 we actually haveto settle the merchants we did not wantit but we haven't to save our systemright just because just because we werewe did not have the connection PHP doesnot support connection pooling right anduh it was a wake-up call for us I thinkthat's that's the wake-up call for us tostart looking into the Microsoft Accesschair because uh we were becoming wewere doing the tremendous growth year onyear and we were seeing that 2x growtheach and every each and every year rightand uh we started getting a lot oftraffic so that's where we actuallydecided uh let's now think about aMicrosoft architecture uh andlike moving away from Mobile tomicroservice is not the easy job it's amulti-quarter multi-year job right uhyou cannot just move in a one day it'sjust not overnight job right so we westarted parallely working on ourmonolith because we want to serve thetraffic and we also started working onthe microserviceGod that's such an interesting time butbut one thing that that is uh reallyfascinating to know that IPL like whowould have thought like when when peoplehear the word IPL or they hear the wordcricket streaming they think of hot starthey they they they they basically thinkof live streaming but who would havethought that when when IPL is about tostart payment system take like are alsounder pressure and that's such aninteresting Insight because it's notthat users are directly interacting withrazor pay users are users are basicallypurchasing food items ordering Grocerieson other platform they are buildingthings on let's say my circle 11 orbasically dream 11 or somewhere they areusing your system and you are gettingaffected by the second order effect likeGod the world is connectedbut yeah but as a but as a financebusiness you have to pay up 24 7 becauseif face down it's a revenue loss forthem and that cannot happen so youruptime your availability is far moreimportant than any other systemsavailability brilliant it has to begreat I'm loving it so then your makeupcall was that uh connection pooling notthere so you have to like you have tobecause you have to split it intomicroservices and all and while and youraise a very very solid reason that likea very solid concern that you cannotjust stop the whole world and say hey weare moving to microservices we won't doanything else you still have to supportyour more or less your database tohandle that kind of load while alsoevolving into micro Services God thatwould have been fascinating but yeahbest experience for so so far becausethat's the journey that every engineerdreams of takinggreat so uh one key thing that comeswith uh splitting monolith to microServices apart from all the businesslogic split that is a different problemaltogether but more importantlysplitting of databases so splitting ofmonolith into microservices involvessplitting of databases splitting ofapplication code splitting of coreentities of your system so uhhow how how was that like like how wasyour thought process throughout whenwhen you folks were splitting from monoto micro and how did you decide how tosplit because that's the biggest problembecause you just can't say yeah likethat's an easy part when you say I haveanswers so notification one service forpayments but here you are the entirepayments so how how did you split yoursystem into microservices like what wasthe thought process behind itcorrect uh so I just mentioned rightit's not overnight job so in Razer paywe have the five more core entities if Italk about the first one is a paymentwhich stores the payments data and thenit's the order which source the so orderis actually highly rated with thepayments table and then we have themerchants entity and uh then basicallywe have The Ledger data which comes intoa transaction the balance table right sothese are the biggest chunk of ourmonolith right so what we decided uh wecannot we cannot stop this stop servingthe traffic right so basically wedecided to make a choice key let's movethe orders into order service Ledger thetwo tables of transaction and balanceinto a ledger service and all thepayment methods like if we talk aboutcard up net banking into the differentmicro Services right that that was themain thought and uh how so now basicallywe have to make sure we are stillserving the traffic uh we are not we aredata consistent while moving intomicroservices and we we are also uptimehighly available that time also right sohow do we ramp up the traffic right sobasically we we started so there werefaces so the phase one was the Dualright phase of the data once we are wehave the micro service ready we do theDual right then we start ramping up thetraffic so when you say do all right wehave interrupt a surge but uh when yousay dual right it means writing tomonolith as well as microservices likelike this correct correct correct sobasically your main golden Sourceapproach is still your monolith butyou're still liking it up to your microservice right so basically we areensuring key whatever data we arewriting into our monit is the same weare writing in the micro service okayonce we have the confidence we can startramping up traffic even the ramping ofthe traffic takes a lot of challengesright uh you cannot just Ram trafficfrom zero to one so uh we build a systemwhich actually takes care of that whichyou call splits and that takes care oframping about traffic so basically youcreate experiments and that experimentswill take care how much traffic to routebut if you want to support that sort ofrandom traffic that are moving over hereyou have to ensure that data is in thatmicro service DB as wellwas this data being written across uhyour monolith database and thecorresponding microservice database in atransaction or was it being doneasynchronouslyyeah so if I talk about dual Reddit weuh we decided what to how to manage theuh the transactions right because you'rewriting the database your data here andyou have to write data and you have tomake consistency over there also becauseyou cannot lose the data while writingthe Dual at your microservice so westarted using the outboxer pattern anduh what we did so basically what isoutboxer pattern right so uh that is uhjust for the distributed transaction sobasically uh your monolith you createanother table uh which is going to writeso read your own rights which you callit right so uh you write to your maintable Source table and then you have tooutbox table and that outbox table datawill flow to any async mechanism you canuse and that Outpost data will flowthrough the uh async mechanism to yourmicro service now if let's say anythinghappens on your transaction right thatoutbox will also roll back right and uhonce it does not roll back it willactually push into your let's say wewere using Kafka over there and theworkers are provided on themicroservices side they were consumingthe message from there and writing intotheir microservice databaseso that's how you maintain theconsistency in the Dual right phasebrilliant so uh using transaction outboxpattern uh in order to solve dual rightsyou because you cannot have distributedtransaction because it would make yoursystems lose its throughput so you wroteat two different tables within the samedatabase one where the actual right hasto go while the second one into anotheradd-off table from that end because it'syour single database your transactionwithin the database can take place so ifyour right fails you to any reason thiswould also roll back automaticallybecause they're part of the same DB andfrom this table you are pulling the dataout using some consumers which areputting it in kafkan from Kafka someother consumers are pulling it andputting it into that microservices DBright yeah yeah correct right great nowit's pretty interesting so yeah actuallyuse transition networks button whichpeople theoretically read here and therefrom the internet you see it in actionbrilliant yeah so then you split acrossso many database that happen uh yousolve the problem of dual right that wasyour phase one and then with your splitservice that is wrapping up traffic onyour micro Services you would as soon asyou get enough confidence you would beincreasing the percentage of trafficthat should go to a micro service versusmono and then once hundred percent isthat you basically cut the chords andyour monolith is then phased out forthat micro service like I'm just talkingabout well but you would have tens and15th of microservices split out so allof them are done then you leave out yourmodel with all togetherokay so just just one blunt number ifit's okay if you don't want to revealbut uh a rough number of databases thatyou handled in production10 15 20. ah I think it's more than thatright now because right now we have alot of micro service right now right somany data every micro service do theirresearch and they they they they do theresearch and they provide like whichkind of database they want to use so wehave right now MySQL we have postgres wehave Cassandra uh for redis we haveredis also for the caching purpose andfor queue mechanism also we actuallybuilt our own service virtually call asMetrouh so the kind of architecture we aremoving into microservice to maintain thetransactions so we're building all thoseuh infra also to maintain theconsistency across the micro serviceswhich we have if you're an engineer youyou have list you have just put out abuffet of databases you said MySQLpostgres Cassandra redis and use and youand you talked about cues you talkedabout Metro you have everything hey niceokay a card and but then with so manydatabases your like and obviously youyou are part of the you are part of thepayments platform team so there would beso much of load on the platform team toensure that developers are alsoproductive like they make the rightdecision choices it's lot of at stake onyour plate relate okay uh one just oneone question on that part uhif you can just like just out of likeslightly out of context uh how about youas a tech lead help some other developerin your team decide between SQL versusnosql just a random question I'mshooting at youokay so that depends on the use caseright uh let's say uh there are multipleservice right now right and you'reworking on the payment service you haveto decide what kind of data you arestoring right uh how what are thechoices you want to make to choose MySQLand nosql database okay what are theproperties you want to store right anduh we have to do certain kind ofperformance uh checks also to to makesure whatever database we are choosingit's going to serve the best traffic ornot right so when we are moving frommicroservice we did all those researchwe did research on mongodb we did asearch on MySQL with this is on apostgres and we actually found out whatare the challenges we are facing onmongodp right and the kind of data wewant to store even away moving away frommonolith we wanted to be asset compliantright and we wanted to be a strongrights happening on the database andagain we actually came to the conclusionyes for payments we actually have to useuh the the actual relation databaseyeah yeah so uh that's why we decided togo ahead with the uh relation databasein most of the payment services likeyour call about the card payment serviceyour uh net banking so your orderservice but there are other services uhwhich actually are using nosql alsoright because their use case depends onthat so if I talk about one of theservices called smart routing whichactually decide which Gateway which bankwhich is who's serving the high successrate has to uh route them payments toright now that service I actually haveto analyze data they are actuallyGathering the data from the banks keywhich bank is uh doing great at thatmoment of time so that we can nowtraffic to that particular bank right sothey are using mongodb over therebecause that's the use case they want tosupport so it depends on the use casewhich microservice want to use whichresourcesso it's not really straightforward whenwe do payment there is so much thingsgoing behind the scene where to whichbank to Route request to card nowcorrect yeah mind-boggling okay let'slet's talk about the elephant in theroom you have large number of databasesbut being a payment system you have toensure consistency but you cannot employstrong consistency because distributedtransactions would lower down yourthroughput that same problem that youstarted with monolith that hey we werewe have to support large amount oftraffic that circles back right again itstares at our face thank you hey if youdo distribute transaction the throughputwould be even lower so you cannot haveyou cannot do distributed transition butyou still have to ensure consistency ofyour data so how do you do itcorrect so um uh for consistency rightso uh one of the most consistent that wewant in recipe system is the Merchant'sbalance right uh that has to be exactlycorrected at every each and every pointof time because we do not want to losethe trust of merchants because they haveintegrated with us with a highlyaccomplished data and that ledger datacannot go wrong right and since we werein monolith everything was happening atransaction block anything happens itgoes roll back to the back to the oldestate now moving away from model tomicroservice we have to ensure that theconsistency between the payment systemand The Ledger system because now Ledgermoves to a different micro service howdo we record the balance uh how do weactually make transactions over thereright so uh and while moving away frommoment we actually analyze whichcomponent is the part of thing that weactually can do async right that canalso achieve the low latency of paymentapis right if you're doing someoperation because everything is ishappening in synchronous in monolith nowwe also want to evolve and we providelow latency calls to our customers rightfor payments so uh where we actuallythought Ledger cannot can be asynchronous fashion because thesettlements happen after t plus one andwe're just recording the virtual accountbalance of the merchant right so uhthat's where we started looking into howto make system correctness and and wewe're looking into the eventualconsistential systemso what was happening in monolith is theconsistency right now while moving awayfrom Mobile to micro service we actuallyprovided correctness of the data usingeventual consistency of Ledger dataokay so you are ensuring the correctbecause that's really important for ourpayments so you have to ensure theoverall correctness of the data but youcannot have strong consistency becauseit would lower your throughput that'swhere you adopted you went for eventualconsistencybut eventual consistency comes with acost of delay so correct then you haveto and now you have to ensure that thedelay is bare minimum those aredifferent kind of challenges that wouldcome there but with eventual consistencywhat uh like how how like a basicallyfirst of all how did you implementeventual consistency like like what'sthe like what does a payment flow looklike now with with you having so manyservicesyeah so if I talk about the payment flownow in the Microsoft architecture it'slet's say we're receiving the paymentfrom the customer it's coming throughyour uh now we have our own infra layerwith the authentication authorizationhappen which we call is Edge and therequest comes over there uh and that itreaches to your first micro servicewhich is which is basically a methoddiagnostic micro service and it alsocreates the order so basically therequest comes over there we actuallyfrom the payment request we decide whichmethod is this payment request is andthen it routes to the particular microservice which is either a card paymentservice or NB Plus or your UPI microservice right now you have done thepayment processing your payment lifecycle is over right now what to do likewe have to record The Ledger data ofpayment like whatever the payment hashappened we have to create that amountof payment with the merchant balancewhich is a account version of Androidmaintaining so we started using CDCpipelines for that so what is CDCpipeline so basically it's a datacapture happening over your databaseright whatever the paper you are writingit to those actually capture all thetransaction logs and flow is through soto different pipelines right so uh noweach and every payment system haveanother table which is writing into atransaction block to which we calloutbox tableagain the same pattern the ledge yeahthe same pattern now this data of outboxis Flowing via different CDC pipeline ineach of the micro services and postinginto a Kafka topic right now whateverThe Ledger service we have built theyhave consumers over there which isconsuming from this Kafka topic andposting into alleged dataso what what is CDC is doing here rightuh they are providing the bare minimumlatency because they process uh lacks ofmessages within a secondright millions of messages in a secondright and we were able to achieve withlow low uh what do you say low latencybetween the payment system and we'reable to record by eventual consistencyright and we actually using two-wayhandshake mechanism between the paymentsystem and The Ledger system we just notrely on the CDCso basically once the data has flownfrom CDC to The Ledger system now Ledgerwill also do the CDC mechanism toprovide the acknowledgment of thepayment serviceonce we receive her the acknowledgmentthen only we say yes the your Ledger ofthis payment has been recordedbrilliant so what's this what's thisother floor doing so let's say now Imade a payment it went through netbanking it went to the net bankingservice it basically recorded thepayment then a CDC pipeline kicks inwhich means that whenever I commit mytransaction you must be using somethinglike a dbzm or or an air byte somethingaround that it reacts the data puts itinto a Kafka topic a bunch of consumersread it of your Ledger service and itupdates The Ledger from The Ledgerservice what's this other flow what whatexactly are you trying to solve that soyeah so let's say now how to make sureyour payment and Ledger has been in syncright we have we have posted thetransaction we have posted a transactiondata into a CDC weapon and we cannotjust rely uh anything happen on thenetwork right anything failure canhappen so how do we make sure you haveLedger has been recorded right sothat definitely what the payment hasdone has Ledger reflected the payment ornotso now let's just do the same mechanismvia CDC to provide the acknowledgment tothe payment system again so now paymentsystem also have the consumer which isreading from the Kafka topic so whateverthe the unique ID they have created werecorded against the paymentright solet's say net banking you must be havinga column like I'm I might be oversimplifying it but you must be having away that this payment is it recorded inLedger or not true or false somethingcorrect correct on this way and otherThat Way Insane so it means that iflet's say for some some duration of timeif a payment is not reflected in Ledgeryou can run a job that picks that amountand ensures that it gets reflected inless so you are ensuring that no entryis missed no matter whatcorrect you you're not actually correctright because that's the third point somake the system more robust right wehave a slippers Cron job also okay whichactually which exactly does the samething it actually fetches all the recordin the payment Source where the wherethe transaction ID has not been recordedwith technology has not been recordedand then it goes back to the call levelservice area but what is it is doingright now it's calling The Ledgerservice in synchronous speed so if anybad day your CDC goes down your workergoes down the synchronous way yeahif there any consumer lag is over thereand you want to process the settlementfor a merchant then you can call it syncand do itif you would want to if you want toexplicitly uh settle the the oralpayments of a merchant you can like doit right away and this is not just aconnection but also feature key if youwould want to tell the favorite sum ofparticular Merchant you can write a wayto waitGod this is really interesting like likeI did not think about that other routethat you have to ensure because uhcorrectness plays such an important partof a third you have to have to ensurethat the entry is definitely recordedover there so like that's that'ssuch an interesting thing because mostpeople just would just push it to Kafkaand assume hey it would get picked uphow are you sure that entry gotreflected therepretty pretty interesting prettyinteresting but yeah it then obviouslycomes with its own challenge that likethat's a uh uh by the way what's thekind of lag that you play with becauselet's say the payment is accepted in theuh in your let's say you're basicallynet packing service how long does ittake on an average just a simple wildguess on that uh so the the replicationlag between thatuh if you're assuming your paymentstatus has been updated at t uh themaximum it can take till now what wehave seen because still we are intransition phase right it's it's just ifnot all the merchants are not moved toyour new Ledger service right stillrecording into the old Ledger service soagain we have two systems running intoparallel time right now uh so let's sayif you start you're recording yourpayments it is updated t uh maximum wehave performance testing what we havedone we have seen T plus two or t plusthree seconds that's it so it's justtaking another like two or three secondsto record in Ledger and to get anaquagement another one secondso when I get an SMS about it so by thetime I go and visit your platform thenumber would have already been reflectedlike because because it would at leasttake me five seconds to log into likelike to open my laptop and log in andeven click or open the app so by thetime a normal user after seeing thatnotification coming on your platformthat payment is by default updated likevery rare translate it would take morethan that but then in order to maintaina very strong SL on that you would beobviously provisioning your consumersand your Capital partitions according tothat right yeah yeah yeah nice so if Italk about the settlements right how dowe are handling so there are certainMerchants who who actually wantsettlements to happen at t plus zero sowhen we call T plus zero because most ofthe domestic merchand do it settlementsat t plus one or t plus two they wantthe data into their actual bank accountsuh whatever transition happen for thatMerchant on after a one day or two daysbecause but there are certain Mutualfundraisers Merchants uh which wants thesettlements to happen at t plus zero sohow do we handle that uh so basicallywe're talking about different Kafkatopics right so uh this outbox tablecontains also the priority of themessage okay now your CDs weapon takecare of pushing those P0 messages into adifferent topic so that you havemultiple partitions over then you canmultiple consumers so that they canactually do it much more faster thaneven that five seconds delay do it in aone second or two secondsnice a classic cave a classic case wherethe customer is King you have to dowhatever it takes to please yourcustomer like they need it you have tobuild it no matter what yeahlike in uh this is where how I see thisis as the beauty of having decoupledsystems like how you have decoupled yourdifferent services such that you haveenjoyed replayability and obviously ifI'm not wrong everything would be Adampotent like even if you receive the sameevent twice it would not make uh much ofa difference because n number of timesalso if you receive the same message itwould not put your system in anincorrect state so correctly ensuringthat ensuring correctness such abeautiful piece so I I think you canmake sureso it's just like like we have justtaken it live right we have done a lotof chaos testing uh we have done a lotof FMA scenarios to figure out what whatcan go wrong on the worst day of Razorperiod so uh we have taken down ourKafka consumers we have taken down thepipelines we have taken down cron jobswe have taken down the whole Ledgerservice at all and we have tested eachand every scenario to figure out whatcall can go wrong right and that's wherelet's say if your division connector isgoing down so how it works it basicallyuh they have Commit offsets right so itonly acquises the commit offsets so nowlet's say if your division when it goeson when it restarts your divisionconnector it picks from the lastCommunity offset okay so that's whereour identical kicks in so if they areconsuming the duplicate message again itdoes not record it again that's how theLedger has been builtnice so you you spoke about somerelatives to the things you spoke aboutrectification you spoke about having aplan B because what if everything goesdown so do you also do some sort of likeyou do you use something like a chaosmonkey or you explicitly take your infradown to see how it reacts like like howdoes that umso we do the our own kind of testing wehave our search regression suits and uhwe we write those test cases and we takeour info down manually right now wedon't have the monkey testing so we takethe neutral down while doing the testingand then and and then see how it reactsto that particular situation so thatkind of testing we have and we havebuilt certain regression suits whichkicks in to check the end to end flow ofthe payment like how it started and ifthe data Corrections is there after thepayment has been done the whole thepayment flow right uh we have unit testcases and now we have started writingwhen we are moving from more to microServices microservice again anotherframework that we've introduced which isslit which we call is a service levelintegration testing so what it doespretty interesting names are that splitsnow this is slit like new phones aregreat at naming things okay slits so sobasically what it does it it checks thedata between the Upstream micro serviceand the downstream micro service it doesnot test the whole flow you just takethe contract between these serviceswhich are correct or not so even if oneservice change the contract it does notaffect it other service so that's how wehave written multiple types of frameworkfor testingdo you like writing testsobviously we have to we have toeven if you don't want to we have towrite it yeah you have to you you allmust be having at least at least 95percent coverage at listen and havingmany at least 95 percent coverage whenyou and you added so much of regressiontest and all and obviously building upevent system is no joke you have toensure you have to have to ensurecorrectness completeness of your systemand whatnot God chaos testing likewhatever people just hear uh like orthey read about these things on theinternet you folks are actually doing ityou folks are doing Chaos monkey likeit's like like some mini version of itat least you have regressions you havetest suits like just just a randomquestion on that part uh do you run allof these suits all of a test on everydeployment or some part of itit runs on every Master commit of therepo and then it again runs on thedeployment of the applicationso of course let's say write the sanityand before deployment on the mastercommitpretty interesting okay uh one questionthat would make me look very pessimistichas anything ever gone wrong that youhad to fix it uh like something thatshould not have gone wrong but it didbut then you add jobs or scripts to fixit right away like any any such examplethat you haveso I think that was one of the horribleincident I had to dig deep and figureout uh it was again including ledger souh what was happening uhit was a part of the monolitharchitecture when we saw this issue andwe actually figured out how to fix thatright so basically what was happening Iwas talking about we were taking a lockon the balance so Merchant has two kindof balances right now in razor pay uhone is the virtual account balance wherewe credit the money whatever the paymentis happening on that system and there isanother kind of a you can say a walletkind of system where Merchants can goand load the money okay now for everypayment we charge a fee right uh Razerpay fee on a transaction so let's say apayment is happening of 100 rupeesyou're charging two rupees out of it sothat two rupees either can be deductedfrom his wallet amount and if the walletamount is not present then we deduct itfrom its virtual account balance that'show the balance work okay now uh one daywe figure out key for most of themerchants the settlement has beenskippedthere was not enough balance and thesettlement was skipped so we starteddigging deeply what actually happenedand uh we we started looking into slowcoil logs everything happened anyexception happened uh we were not ableto figure out right so uh since themoment architecture was something likethat so for each in the balance table uhfor each Merchant there was a single rowokay and there's a column called balanceso let's say the current balance is 500and a new payment transition happens ofhundred rupees now how it updates itlike it it fetches the balance in theLocking situation and uh it updates itto 500 plus 100 and then it updatesagain and then release the logsame thing happens in the credits alsocorrect so uh now what is happening souh we were digging deep so we built ourown Ledger system on the Google Sheetsto figure out what is happening wepulled out all the transitions data okayand and and the best part it was onlyhappening on a high TPS Merchants when Itook a high RPS so it was happening atvery rare scenario which we have tofigure out also how to uh actually makeit uh again in the staging environmentright how to make it replay again thestatistic environment so we starteddoing the performance testing and thenwe eventually figured out it ishappening and uh how it is happening sothere was another process which wasrunning concurrently with the paymentsflow which is the payment transfer flowokay so if you see the payments wastaking a log on the credits table firstand then on the balance table right thepayment transfer flow was taking a lockon balance table first and then on thecredits table that lock has happened anddue todue to some of the configuration issueson my SQL sideit was not throwing that exception anddirty reads were happeningso you can imagine uh every payment isreading the same balance yes on highconcurrency and it's updating the wrongbalance right and the balance was notupdated correctly so the settlement wasskippedhow do I fix it right so we startedlooking at the performance schema of mySQL table we started looking the binlocks of it and we actually analyzed keyyes there are two threads which areactually trying to take a lock and bothare getting the locks how did it happenright and the exception was actuallyconsumed by the application law becauseof that feature was not enabled of theMySQL attribute so uh that buteventually we figured it out wecorrected our data and we fixed the bugalso so and we made sure he RCI catchesthose bugsso that's insane one thing that youspoke about this that uh uh yoursettlements were skipped and that wasreally important like you did not let alot of things go wrong even though theeven though the deadlock was happeningyou still ensure that if it is not rightyou would skip it rather than ratherbasically letting the wrong informationso again uh correctness of the dataunless and until you are 100 sure youshould not be moving forward certaininterests correctly correct and databasedeadlock everyone has heard about itvery few seed you have fixed it so yeahand the best part is we we're actuallymaking sure it is not happening inmicroservice attention now so becausenow we have a different database and howwe are scaling The Ledger platform nowit's it's a totally differentarchitecture right now like how thedatabase has been built for Ledger anduh to make a more robust system right wewe are talking about we have a Quran wehave a two-way handshake mechanism onCDC right now it's just not that we weactually run reporting engine on ourbomb storage which actually do a paritychecks between two payment sourcesso even if in the worst scenarios wehave our parity check to make robustnessof the systemand that's really but like most peopledon't even think about having this butthis this a synchronous job that isrunning which is just ensuring thecorrectness of the system becomes suchan important piece of component becauseit can like right away through becausethese are not infrastructure levelalerts these are yeah yeah these areyour business logic alerts where arraythis these two payments is having somesort of parity or the replication lag ishigh or something around that like theseare your business logic based alertswhich are much more important especiallyfor a finance I've I've worked onsomething very similar at basically oneof my past employers that we had toensure the correctness of the data againnot on the import success because it isvery much possible that interest isrunning much finer like it's it's allit's all it's all uh happy go luckystate in the introspective side butbusiness logic is all messed up and selljobs people think it's hard it's nothack it's like when you want to enterthe correctness of the system I have todo it right yeahoh brilliant this is this is such insuch an interesting piece of insight uhyou thought about chaos you talked abouttesting so much of unit test regressiontests so many things go behind us inthat way we make payment we use UPI likelike nothing we make or we makepurchases we make purchase on speakersno matter they all use few folks behindthe scenes and just imagine raise a petdown they can't make the payment Revenuelost such an important piece of softwareyou folks are writingdope to be honest nice so yeah uh that'sall like thanks thanks honey this waspretty interesting I got to be honest Igot to learn so much and I and I reallyam sure not I don't even hope I'm 100sure people watching this they wouldlove they would love to dive deep intothis part like how you folks are doingit and obviously the the overall kind ofbuffet you you presented of all thedatabases would make and Engineers sohappy arraylike brilliant brilliant brilliant andagain really happy to uh have you workedon like to be able to speak with yousomeone who has seen such issues uhespecially the the last part when wetalk about that you have to put the youhave to load the data in Google Sheetsto ensurethat's how you're like in most cases ofwhen you are working with systems thatsome cases happen only at high TPS Ihave to do whatever it takes to enterso thanks thanks so much Arjun for suchinteresting discussion loved everysingle part of it so folks who arewatching do do hit this video like likedo like this video uh go through it andI'm 100 sure you have to go through thisvideo at least twice to understand whathas happened but uh such is the power ofengineering like when good Engineerscome together they build systems at thisscale to ensure correctness of dataright and it's not just normal data it'smoney they can't let anything go wrongand this is the beauty of engineeringwhich I want all of you all of you to gothrough learn and plus a huge shout outto Razer pay team and that engineeringblog I would highly encourage each andevery one of you to go through it likesuch a brilliant resource for everyengineer no matter at which stage youare at go read it you'll learn a lot andlike always I always promote Implementwhat you have right it's easy to mimicin local state but do it but once againthanks so much so much Arjun it wasquite fun uh brilliant brilliant havingyou sometime in the future paths crossagain will have yet another discussionsure sure thank you thank you so much",
    "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the YouTube video transcript:\n\nThe video features Arjun from Razorpay discussing their journey from a monolithic architecture to microservices, focusing on the challenges and solutions related to data consistency in a payment system. Razorpay initially used PHP with Laravel and MySQL for rapid feature deployment. However, increased traffic, particularly during IPL events, exposed limitations like connection pooling issues with PHP, leading to database connection exhaustion. This triggered the move towards microservices.\n\nThe transition involved splitting the monolith into multiple services based on core entities like payments, orders, and ledgers. A key challenge was maintaining data consistency during this process. To achieve this, Razorpay adopted a dual-write approach, writing data to both the monolith and the new microservices. The Outbox pattern and CDC (Change Data Capture) pipelines with Kafka were used to asynchronously replicate data between the monolith database and the microservice databases, ensuring eventual consistency. To guarantee data correctness, a two-way handshake mechanism was implemented, where the Ledger service acknowledges receipt of payment data back to the payment service. Additionally, a cron job acts as a safety net, periodically checking for and correcting any inconsistencies between the payment and ledger systems. Arjun emphasizes that they performed chaos engineering and SLIT (Service Level Integration Testing) by manually taking down Kafka consumers, pipelines and whole Ledger services at all to simulate real-world failures and test resilience. They also have comprehensive test suits running on every Master commit and deployment to check the entire payment flow and data correctness.\n\nThe discussion further explores strategies for ensuring data correctness, including validation layers in the application, the design decisions between SQL and NoSQL databases, implementing idempotency, and building robust fallback mechanisms. Arjun shares a specific example of a deadlock issue they faced in the monolithic architecture and how they resolved it, highlighting the importance of monitoring performance schemas, analyzing binlogs, and implementing parity checks. The video offers valuable insights into the practical considerations of moving to microservices, particularly for systems that require high data consistency and availability."

    "transcript": "so the domain of software engineeringevolves rapidly which means one tool orTech that is relevant today might notstand tall a few years later thisrequires us to stay relevant by learningnew skills continuously so today from mypersonal experience I'll try to answerthis one question how to learn betterand faster as a software engineer Itypically follow these five things toensure I'm learning continuously andevolving as a better engineer everysingle day so here it goes the first oneis what I called register your curiositywe as humans no exceptions are curiousby Nature whenever we something wheneverwe see something fascinating wetypically think hey how does this worklet's say you started working with thedatabase let's say my SQL and you see itguarantees acid you would wonder how isthis database implementing acid rightwhen you see red is you see hey itsupports so many amazing data structurehow is it doing it so given this givenyou are so curious about it what hashappened is it has intrigued you it hasspiked that interest now we typicallystart pondering on how that happens butthen some of the other distraction comesand we just let it go now what happensis which is where what I typically do iswhenever something has spiked myinterest I immediately open my notetaking app and make an entry of itthat's it just one blunt entry ofsomething that has spiked the interestnow here the key thing is because thisis something which is which hasnaturally intrigued me now what happensis because it has naturally intrigued meI do not want or I don't I won't need anexternal motivation to go and read aboutit whenever I would revisit that thingit would automatically come hey becauseit was naturally I was naturallyinclined to know that I wouldautomatically go and read it so but it'simportant that whenever has somethingspiked interest you don't just let it goinstead pick your favorite note takingapp and just make an entry about it forexample I recently or or rather fewmonths ago I was reading about or I sawsomewhere something called as a conveyGame of Life I was very intrigued by itI immediately Googled and I found a termcalled cellular automata and thatcellular automata seems like a huge amlike huge enough field I'm like hey Ineed to read that what I did Iimmediately made an entry into now thisis where what I do is I make an entrynot just that hey I want to read thisbut why I want to read this for exampleI need to know because the reason iswhat has spiked that interest what Iwant to read is okay but why I want toread it is really important because thatis something that I don't want to forgetwhen I read that Y part I would be morelikely to go and you know read about itI'm like I'm I'm implicitly being pushedinto reading about it I may choose toread it a month or two or five later butthat's fine but at least I would have areason a personal reason to read it forexample I want to read about cellularautometa because I was fascinated afterseeing conest Game of Life or I want todive deep into redis internals becauseI'm fascinated after seeing the advanceddata structures it supports so learningand why it's really important right okaynow apart from that whenever you haveany question any anything that hasspiked your interest just in at leastjot jot those questions down that heylet's say you were reading aboutdatabase you want you saw how adistributed SQL database like cockr DBguarantees as it that's a question youmight not know the answer just make anote of it because not everything needsto be done today right so anything thatcan be deferred just deer it into yournotes and then revisit it often to justgo deeper into those responding aspectsright okay so that's first register yourcuriosity because you have storing it inyour note teing app so when you revisityou would not be missing things out andyou don't have to fill everything inyour head that hey I would remember thisand that you can occasionally revisityour notes and just see this is what Inow that I have time I can read moreabout this right okay the second thingis what I called jump start now whathappens is we as humans no exceptionsagain are lawe like to Deer things we like toprocrastinate and that's very natural sobut what happens is when you are whenyou would want to learn something youhave to get rid of your laziness soinstead of waiting for that correct timejust start right now instead of waitingfor the best resource to learn somethingstart right now and especially whenyou're going on that 0o to one Journeywhere let's say you don't know anythingabout cockroach DB but now you want wantto dive deep into it so when you'regoing into this 0 to one Journeyliterally any resource is good you don'twant to find the best resource anywaybecause when you are more familiar withthe things the terms the internals oranything it would be very natural foryou to filter out and say hey this doesnot seem deep enough let me find someanother resource but when you are atAbsolute Zero it really does not matterso just start with anything andeverything that you have right so jumpstarting is really important importantdo not procrastinate is really importantI never procrastinate I have that listmaintained whenever I find time Iliterally jump into it instead offinding the best resource out there tolearn something or finding the best timeto do it or Worse finding a continuoustime block where no one would disturb meit's not possible in today's day and ageso whenever you find that slice of timego for it right the third one is what Icalled do the laundry so we never we alldon't like to do laundry because that'sboring so what I mean by doing thelaundry it's simple that we typicallylike let's say I got an idea that hey Iwould dive deep into redish internals sonow what happens I can just keepthinking hey if I know redish internalsah I would do this I would do this Iwould create this post I would createthis videos and whatnot now what happensis we like to live in a beautiful worldmade up in our head because how like forexamp how amazing it would be to learngoang or I can do so much I wouldoptimize this particular code I wouldwrite I would like rewrite my entiremicro service now what happens is youare building stuff in your head ratherthan doing the laundry what is doing thelaundry over here just get your local IDset up and start coding the things outinstead of going through tutorial hellwhere you're reading tutorial aftertutorial after tutorial and notimplementing it that's where the problemis because we as Engineers unless anduntil we Implement everything is just inour head we would not be sure on howthose things work or what are thepractical limitations of it what are thepracticals problem with the things thatyou would want to learn so just get yourlocal ID set up in case you cannot dolocal ID setup just start something on awebsite like replit right which whichgives you remote ID and start codingthings out and here I'm taking exampleof learning a language it could be adatabase it could be anything just getyour hands dirty do the laundry andstart the coding things outso so so important no matter at whatstage of your career you are at pleasedon't just do like don't just keepreading and reading and reading focus onimplementation like what I personally dois any research paper that I read I tryto implement the core of it I won'timplement the entire system but at leastthe core of it that seems veryinteresting or I am unsure about I goand Implement that really really reallyimportant the next one is what I callthe inverse power law so inverse powerlaw is basically the thing is that a lotof people like for example whenever Iwant to learn something what happens isI'm actually fascinated by some Advancedconcept if I'll give an example let'ssay I am intrigued by Red internals sowhat I would do is hey how does redusimplement let's say GEOS special queriesnow that's an advanced part why should Idirectly jump on that because I cannotjust say hey because that is interestingI'll directly jump into that but nowwhat happens is when you jump into thatyou will stumble upon so many new termswhich you are unaware of and you say heyI don't know stuff and you keep and youtypically leave it there that's wrongwhat should you do in such situation isyou always start from absolute zero andthen increase right so inverse power lawis basically you spend more time onBasics and then gradually you lower itdown so that's a inverse power law thatwe all studied right so follow thatspend more time preparing the basics andthe foundation side it would make iteasier for you to grasp the advancedstuff right so try to start and it doesnot mean that you should just keepfocusing on Basics and Basics and Basicsand spend very little time over here butif you don't spend time understandingthe basics or not have a solidfoundation it would be very difficultfor you to understand when things gotough right how are this Advanced partimplemented you would know you would notknow that so it's really important to doit for example for example uh basicallychat GPT and large language models areall the AG now if I just directly starthey I want to know how large languagemodels work I'll open the paper or I'llopen a few videos some random thingswould happen and as soon as the mathpart comes in I'll gone because I don'tknow the basics of neural networks Idon't know basics of calculus how wouldI be able to comprehend how llms workright so it's always better it's alwaysbetter to understand that hey you needto spend decent enough time focusing onthe fun fundamentals before jumping intothe advanced stuff although the advancedstuff actually intrigued you more rightso remember this inverse power law moretime spend on the easy part it wouldmake you spend lesser time when thingsgo tough right okay that's the next oneand the final one the final one thefifth one juggle and time box so weunderestimate how much we can do inparallel we typically think that hey letme pick up this one thing I'll do thisone thing really well but now whathappens is you get bored of it if youthink about it the last time you wereintrigued by something you wanted tostudy something you typically left offafter a few days because you got boredof it why did you get bored either itbecomes really difficult that you arenot able to understand or it just isboring right so what happens is intoday's day and age it's very easy to bedistracted very easy to be distracted bysomething fancier for example let's sayI started going through internals ofcockroach DP but then suddenly Istumbled upon an article that talksabout lenux kernel I would be veryintrigued by it so but now what happensis I would leave this cockr DB aside andI would jump into that other ship andthen while I doing that I would findsomething else I would jump on somethingelse and then something else eventuallyI'm not able to accomplish anything andthat's wrong so instead what you shoulddo is pick not just one thing pick twoor three depending on your capacity butat least two pick at least two thingsthat you would want to learn in parallelif you get bored by one switch to otherif you get bored by the second oneswitch to the first one this way youwould able to make significant progresson almost both of them and you would dojustice you would do justice to yourdecision of learning that particularstuff I've seen so many people startingwith goang and then IM no rust is allthe I'll go and switch to rust and theydon't even know goang or don't even knowrust that's the problem right so it'salways better pick two things in par twolanguages two texts whatever you findinteresting and amusing but pick twothings to do in parallel both by oneswitch to other do justice to yourdecision now but how long let's say youpicked up something and you realize thatthis is really boring and I cannot dothat for example large language ModelsAll the Rage you saw the hype you jumpedon the ship and said I'll study this butwhat happened is after some days yourealize maths is not my cup of tea sonow what right you cannot just leavethat you would feel like hey because Ispent one month but now I leave thatthat would be wrong I'm doing Injusticeand whatnot but it's okay what youshould do is what I typically do as wellas is I time box every single thing forexample if let's I want to learn goang Iwould time box it hey I'm giving 3months time for me to study golang butwithin that I would evaluate in onemonth if I'm good enough like is thisgood enough for me to extend that rightso one month I'm just time boxing itthat I won't spend more time than thatand it would be my decision- making callthat hey do I want to dive deeper or notbut give yourself enough time do timeboxing of that stuff so that you justdon't go keep on learning and learningand learning that one thing throughoutright because there are far too manyinteresting things to miss out on to behonest right so learning multiple thingsat once has ensured me that I don't getbored of stuff because if I get bored ofone I can go to another so now and whytwo things is because let's say if Idon't pick two things if I get Bor ofone what's the alternative Instagramscrolling right don't do that so whichis where I pick two things to study inparallel and if I get bored of one Iimmediately switch to other that's theeasiest way for me to do it but alwaysremember it's okay to get bored it'sokay to drop something that you startedit's okay to not fulfill your commitmentof learning a specific thing it's okayeveryone has limitations and you shouldacknowledge that that hey it's not mycup of day for example deep learning isnot my cup of tea so I would just leaveit I would not invest a lot of time intolearning calculus from absolute scratchand doing it right giving an exampleright so it's okay to drop things thatyou realize that it's not good enoughfor me at the moment to study and yeahthese are the five things that Itypically do to ensure that I learnbetter and faster just a quick gist ofit the first one was register yourcuriosity second one was jump startthird one was do the laundry fourth onewas the inverse power law and fifth onewas juggle and time box and yeah this isall what I wanted to cover in this one Ihope I hope this helps you in becoming abetter engineer learning better learningfaster and having an accelerated careergrowth So yeah thank you so much forwatching that's it for this one I'll seeyou in the next one thanks a",
    "summary": "This video outlines five key strategies for software engineers to learn better and faster, crucial in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. The first, \"Register Your Curiosity,\" emphasizes capturing fleeting moments of interest by immediately noting them in a dedicated app, including *why* you're interested. This creates a personal motivation to revisit and learn about it later. The second strategy, \"Jump Start,\" tackles procrastination by advocating for immediate action with available resources, regardless of perfection. Any resource is good when starting from zero, as familiarity builds naturally. \"Do the Laundry,\" the third point, stresses practical application over passive learning. The speaker advises setting up a local development environment and coding, rather than getting stuck in \"tutorial hell,\" emphasizing hands-on experience to solidify understanding.\n\nThe fourth strategy, \"Inverse Power Law,\" advises prioritizing a strong foundation of basics before diving into advanced topics. Spending more time mastering fundamentals makes grasping complex concepts easier and avoids discouragement. Finally, \"Juggle and Time Box\" encourages learning multiple subjects in parallel to prevent boredom and maintain engagement. The speaker suggests picking two or three topics and switching between them when interest wanes. He also recommends time-boxing each subject with periodic evaluations to prevent over-commitment to topics that may not be a good fit, emphasizing it's okay to abandon a learning path if it proves unsuitable. These five steps are designed to create a sustainable and effective learning process for continuous growth as a software engineer."

    "transcript": "so great to be here I have a hard timebelieving that at 9 a.m. on a Sunday allof you are here let's make sure all ofyou are awake just so I also get a feelfor the audience let's do a show ofhands how many of you are engineers okyeah it's like 2/3 how about do we haveproduct managers here some not that manyhow about UX design folks huh that'squite a few so primarily engineersthat's fine there's nothing wrong withthatit's great to be here and perhaps moreof what I say you know will relate tothe audience because like you I'm anengineer and part of being an engineer Ishould start out though by saying thatI'm not a an academic in the field ofCareer Management I'm not like studiedhundreds and thousands of careers andwritten books and done PhD and so on sowhat I'm going to tell you today is aset of observations and anecdotes that Iformed over the years and these arenecessarily personal and you should makesure that you always have a criticalyear to what you're hearing because yourmileage in all of this might vary it'simportant to be critical in things thatwe do and roughly the way I structuredmy you know talk today is in terms of aseries of observations around differentstages of an engineer's career differentstages really of somebody intact howshould they think about growth how dothey think about progress what arethings to watch out for and you know Ihope you will find that useful I'llstart out with the first thing which islike what should you work on I realizethat many of many of you have madechoices like you've already sort ofembarked on a career but you know I'veswitched careers around a few times inmy life as I said I used to be you knowI used to be an academic I work for BellLabs I did research I sort of went intomore software engineering afterswitched away from that I love softwareengineering but I clearly don't do muchof that but I do think it's reallyimportant for all of you to think abouthow do you want to be spending your timeI have kids now who are 16 and 18 one isa freshman in college the other one's ajunior and so we have discussions likethis and I've come to the conclusionthat the best way for you to judge whatyou should do is think about whether thething that you want to do engrosses youso much that you'll gladly stay up thewhole night or get up super early in themorning to actually do I discord alongthe way that video games could do thisfor me okay it's just like I didn't evenneed to lot you know eat or go to thebathroombut I decided after a while that thatwas not such a smart move for my careerso you know outside of that generallyworking on things that people value whatare you passionate about and the reasonI say that is because in this day andage all of us spend way too much timeworking to be not passionate about ityou know there are like thumb rules andstudies out there that basically saysomething too is something to the effectof if you truly want want to be anexpert at something you need to spend onthe order of 10,000 hours at it tobecome an expert that's a lot of time 10hours a day still you are talking 3 plusyears to get on it so if you're notpassionate about what you're doing it'shard to gain deep deep expertise andthat is something I continue to tell asa core piece of career advice to everysingle person I discovered when I wasdoing software engineering for exampletime stopped I could stay up the wholenight doing it I loved creatingsomething from nothing and so you needto make sure that the area that you pickthe kind of work that you do drives thatkind of deep passion from within you andlet's say you you got lucky like some ofus you know you have the deep expertiseyou do something that you lovewhat does growth mean at thatI always encourage people to get the bigpicture of what their team isaccomplishing do not be confined in howthey approach work you need the deepexpertise but that shouldn't stop youfrom knowing what's going on around youeven at Google for example I find thattoo many people will decide that theyare a back-end person and that's allthey want to do they look down oneverything that everybody else does ourproduct management who cares this islike our UX engineer that can't be thathard can it that's a bad attitude tohave it's important that you have adegree of breath in what you do becauseyou need to create products that yourconsumers your customers love and whileit's not possible to be a deep expert ineverything that goes on it is importantto understand what is it that you knowthat you need to create a full productwhat does product management mean forthis product what does great UX designmean what apps have brilliant motiondesign versus not you might not be ableto create it but it should at least beable to understand what drivesexcellence and there are new areascoming up all the time that I think it'simportant for all of us to know moreabout growth is a hot topic and it'svery clear that there is a sciencethat's being born there I think it'simportant for a you know for a goodengineer for a good product manager toreally understand everything that goesinto creating great products and let'snow take one step further you know youhave an idea what's going on within yourteam you are a great designer or productmanager or engineer what does growthmean a lot of us for example you knowaspire to be tech leads or managers andto get to something like thatyou certainly need to get to a placewhere you're curious about what's goingon in the areas around you and this iswhere the broadhelps the more you know about what yourimmediate group is accomplishing orwhere it needs to go the moreopportunities that you end up having themore supportive you are of the peoplearound you the more you can be seen as aleader this is not to say that you knowyou should be spending all your timehelping others you need to still bespending the majority of your time inwhat you're being paid to do in yourwork but it's important to understandthe context and be helpful around ananother firm piece of advice that I havefor lots of people is being unhappy withthe job or team that you do is not arecipe for promotion I'll often havepeople that will come to me and say youknow my job's kind of easy and I'm kindof bored and this is like I can do morebut who wants to promote unhappy peopleor give them bigger responsibilities itdoesn't work like thatso being really absorbed in the core ofwhat you what your team does believingin it driving it forward is an essentialrecipe for getting more responsibilitiesthe more it is seeing that you actuallycare about the team the more it is seenthat you are taking the team forward themore likely it is that your manager isgoing to say aha so once a person shouldtake on more responsibilities it'simportant for us to remember that ifyou're unhappy in your job I'm notsaying you should continue you might beright for a change but changes aretypically lateral moves they don't comewith promotion I said change issomething that you should contemplatebut if you want to move forward you needto be at a place where at its coreyou're in a happy place let's now switchgears and talk about what it is to be amanager I can assure you this is one ofthe scariest things that all of us gothrough you know for the first time inour life we move from being in asituation where we make a difference toour careers to being entirely dependentonpeople in fact one of the things I tellpeople is having an attitude or beingthe smartest person in the room is adisqualification almost for being themanager of a team because those kind ofmanagers have a lot of attitude theydon't bring out the best in the team'sas a manager is really important for youto understand that you're now aboutenabling people you succeed and thepeople in your team succeed it's a verydifferent mentality it is all about howare you going to create opportunity forother people already going to you knowbring out the best in them how are yougoing to make the people in your teamgrow and how are you going to be anactive advocate further and as youbecome a more senior manager you getinto even scarier topics people come toyou and say you know you should help megrow my career my first reaction to thatis say what I have not planned my careerI barely have a clue about what I'mgoing to do next month you want me tohelp you but you have to think about notjust what is this person capable oftoday what are they capable of two yearsfrom now even if you didn't plan yourown career you need to think forward andsay there is my group going to be twoyears from now what does this personcapable of what are their strengths andweaknesses what can I tell them aboutwhere they can grow perhaps they need tobe a more effective communicator perhapsthey need to work better with otherpeople within the team all of a suddenas a senior manager you're a judge ofother people and your success dependsvery much on the few bets that you getto make whether its product direction orits people so thinking hard about thequalities that you want ends up making ahuge differenceand I'll tell you the two qualities thatI look for whenever I think about givingresponsibility to people I look formotivation for drives and I look veryhard for a willingness to learn all ofyou know this by the time you're 25 and30 you've learned a lot but you oftendiscover that finding the time and thementality to go learn something brandnew becomes really hard for people youneed a special kind of motivation and itis at least my observation that thatkind of drive and motivation to want tokeep learning to want to get better atthings is hard and that's the qualitythat I really really look for and lotsof people I know look for when it comesto who should be given more opportunityand the kind of learning that you haveto go through is can be excessivelyawkward I can assure you for examplegiving public speeches not my thingI was very bad at this but you'refortunate you can get help from greatpeople I still remember this one timethen I did a 90 second snippet in frontof a speech coach and then he wrotefeedback for me that took 15 minutes toread on all the things I could be doingbetter it's incredibly humbling but it'san important part of growing and being aleader if you want to lead a team withseveral hundred people in itspeaking motivating is an essentialaspect of being that leader you don'tget to duck it you see people do thisthey'll come up and they're not able toput ideas together it actually gets intheir way of being an effective leaderI'm not saying public speaking is theonly thing that there is there are manydifferent qualities my point isleadershipdifferent things at different times andit is important to have the the drive towant to learn and the willingness toinvest time and effort to actually goand learn I kind of want to touch on twothings that we don't really talk about awhole lot when it comes to managementbut really being part of an enterprisethe first one is how to be a good peeryou know you often work in groups ofpeople as I said earlier really focusingon goals that the team has is veryimportant and really driving thatforward and having a sense of balancebetween the work that you do and thework that other teams do is veryimportant for representing your team yousee some managers would incrediblyaggressive about always advocating forthe easiest thing for their team they'renot doing right by the larger effortthat they're a part of their company youalso see managers that routinely sign uptheir teams for lots of work and theirteams hit them you don't want to be ineither in either place you need a senseof balance to how you think about howyou work with other teams and by the wayone of the biggest mistakes if you're amanager that you can do with another comanager is offer to have them report toyou I think people do this pretty oftenthere is no faster way there is nofaster career suicide than havingconversations like that if there arerestructurings to be had it'll come fromsomeplace else it's not you knowtypically in your place to suggest thatand with peers it's also important toremember that you need to have a greatrelationship with them because tomorrowthey might be asked to report to you andif you have a bad relationship with themtrust me they'll scuttle it before thiseven gets off the groundon the other hand might also be the casetomorrow that you report to that it'shappening of times in my career and soessential cordial relationships are areally important part of being in anycompany on the final thing that I'lltouch on with respect to these kinds ofinterpersonal relationships is howactually to be a good employeeall of us have love-hate relationshipswith our managers we always want them todo more you know like they don'trepresent me fairly enough they don'tsee all this brilliant future that Ihave to offer my opportunities arelimited none of us ever pauses andthings I wonder what they're thinking Iwonder what kind of problems they haveI had this engineer this brilliantengineer called John Fitzpatrick in myteam and I always remember that at everyone-on-one he would ask me hey sridharhow are you doing is there anything Ican do to help you and that stayed withme because he genuinely cared too oftenwe have relationships where we just wantand we never put ourselves in the otherperson's spot and think about what is itwhat are their fears their insecuritiesthe things that they are worried abouthow can we be helpful having theperspective builds a better relationshipbetween you and your manager and makesmany other things possible don't meet onit's not always possible to be friendswith your manager that's hardit comes to a whole bunch of otherdynamics that are very tricky but to seethem as a person to see that you can beyou know contributing in helpful ways tothem is something that's important foryou to remember I want to end my talkwith giving backthe thing as I reflect on my career thething that stands out for me is thenumber of people that saw things in methen I had no way to see all the wayfrom my you know high school mathteacher who pushed me to do more thingsto my PhD thesis advisor Paris wasalways telling me through thought youreally need to work harder I did notlisten to him and I was doing a PhD andyou know but he was generous with thisadvice are the many people at a placelike Google Jeff Huber one of my earlybosses at Google are Alan Eustace whoused to head all of engineering atGoogle are the legendary Bill Campbellall of these people have spent many manyhours with me and it's very clear to mein retrospect that they weren't reallyexpecting anything back they did itbecause they saw something in me that asI said I didn't see they believed in memore than I did and think about it I runa team that makes a hundred billiondollars of revenue I can confidentlyassure you I have done nothing in mylife that makes me worthy of this jobit's not possible like what exactly doto prepare yourself for something likethis and yet Larry and Sergey saw it fitto give me this opportunityso my point overall is that all of usare where we are because of theopportunities that the world around usgives us I know all of you have greataspirations for your careers and I hopeall of you do well but I also need youto remember that you're alreadyincredibly privileged that you're partof an elite that happens to befortunately honestly big not bigfor doing it justice happenstance you'repart of an industry that is growing thathas a bright future that has a hugeimpact on humanity the reason I say allof this is I think it is important butat different stages in your career andyour life you think about what do youneed to do to contribute back it cantake many forms I was a diversitysponsor at Google for several yearsSusan Wojcicki took over from merecently and it was eye-opening for mebecause I realized that theopportunities that I got theopportunities that I took for grantedwere not things that everybody gotwhether they were within Google notoutsidemany people simply do not have the goodfortune to get a great education and agreat job in tech and even if they makeit it's a lot harder for them all of uslove to cling on to this myth the techis incredibly meritocratic that like allthe promotions are decided solely on thebasis of merit nothing could be furtherfrom the truth all of us are a bundle ofbiases you need to be conscious aboutthem and you need we also need tounderstand that people come with verydifferent personalities and verydifferent attitudes so as a manager forexample it's kind of your job to bringout everybody to bring out that quietperson in the room and you know find outmore about them and perhaps give them anopportunity it is your job to challengepeople and help them achieve more whenit comes to a tricky topic like givingback I've gone through many stages in mylife but I'm just frozen in placethis just feels so hard that I don'tknow what to do and that's a commonproblem that all of us haveI would encourage you again to think bigbut act small if you are in a leadershipposition simply being the mentor for afew people I routinely meet many peopleevery month and I try my best tocontribute giving people opportunitiestaking a bet on people or if you are ahiring manager perhaps having a Rooneyrule where you actually make sure thatyou look at a pool of candidates asopposed to simply filling it up withpeople that you already know you cancontribute in many many ways I thinkthis is really important that all of usthink about doing it because we are theprivileged and it's important for us tobe giving back and thinking about youknow how do we how do we become moreinclusive and how do we contribute backto the society that gives us so much sowith that I thank you for your time andI hope you have a great content thankyouyou",

    "transcript": "all right wow fullroom I'm just going to jump right inabout 15 years ago my stepmother andwe'll call her Francis for the sake ofthis conversation became ill she hadaches through her whole body she hadweakness she had difficulty standing andby the time they got her to the hospitalshe had paralysis in her arms and legsand it was a terrifying experience forher and obviously for us as wellWell turns out she had something calledgon Beret Syndrome has anybody heard ofthis before I'm just curious oh lots ofpeople good well not good hopefully youhaven't had firsthand experience with itit's an autoimmune disorder and it's areally interesting one uh it's triggeredby some kind of external factor which isfairly common with autoimmune disordersbut what's interesting about this one isthat the antibodies will directly attackWhat's called the myin sheath that wrapsaround the axon that long SE in nervecells and it essentially eats away at itsuch that the signals become verydiffuse and so you can imagine thesesymptoms of pain and weakness andparalysis are all quite logical when youunderstand what's goingon the good news is is that it'streatable uh either throughplasmapheresis where they filter yourblood outside your body or antibodytherapy and that was successful thelatter was successful forFrancis what was interesting also washer reaction to this conditionshe became much more disciplined abouther health she started eating rightexercising more she started pictatedoing chiong and taii to improve herhealth and she was committed to havingthis kind of event never happened to heragain and what this event uh reallyunderscores for me is how amazing thehuman body is uh and how something assimple as the act of breathing orinteracting with the world is actually apretty morac ulous thing and it'sactually an act of Bravery to a certainextent there are so many forces in theworld so many allergens and bacterialinfections and various things that cancause problems forus and so you might be wondering why thehell are we talking about this at amicroservices uhtalk but just as breathing is amiraculous Act of Bravery so is takingtraffic in your microservicearchitecture you might have trafficspikes you might have a Dos attack youmight introduce changes into your ownenvironment that can take the entireservice down and prevent your customersfrom accessing it and so this is whywe're here today we're going to talkabout microservice architectures whichhave huge benefits but also talk aboutthe challenges and the solutions thatNetflix has discovered over the lastseven years uh wrestling with a lot ofthese kinds of failures andconditions so I'm going to do a littlebit of an introduction I'll introducemyself and I'm going to spend a littlebit of time LEL setting on microserviceBasics so we're all using the samevocabulary as we go through this andthen we'll spend the majority of ourtime talking about the challenges andsolutions that Netflix has encounteredand then we'll spend a little bit oftime talking about the relationshipbetween organization and architectureand how that's relevant to thisdiscussion so by way of introductionhello I'm Josh Evans uh I started atNetflix uh had a career before this butI this is the most relevant part uh in1999 joined Netflix about a month beforethe subscription DVD service launched uhI was in the e-commerce space as anengineer and then a manager uh and gotto see that transition from ane-commerce perspective in terms of howwe integrated streaming into theexisting DVDbusiness 2009 I moved over right intothe heart of streaming managing a teamthat's today called playback servicesthis is the team that does DRM andmanifest delivery recording Telemetrycoming back from devices uh I alsomanaged this this team during a timewhen we were going International gettingonto every possible device in the worldand just this side project of movingfrom data center to Cloud so it'sactually quite an interesting andexcitingtime for the last three years I've beenmanaging a team called operationsengineering where we focus onoperational excellence engineeringvelocity uh monitoring and alerting sothink about things like delivery uhchaos engineering a whole wide varietyof functions to help Netflix Engineersbe successful operating their ownservices is in the cloud so you'll seethat there's an end date there Iactually left Netflix about a month agoand today I'm actually thinking a lotabout Ariana Huffington uh catching upon my sleep for the first time in quitesome time uh taking some time offspending time with my family trying tofigure out what this work life balancething looks like uh actually this willbe mostly life balance which will begreat big shift from what I was doingbefore uh Netflix as you know is theleader in subscription Internet TVservice it produces es or licensesHollywood independent and local contenthas a growing slate of pretty amazingoriginals and at this point is at about86 million members uh globally andgrowing quite rapidly Netflix is inabout 190 countries today and haslocalized in tens of languages that'suser interface subs anddubs thousands of device platforms andall of this is running on microserviceson AWSso let's dig in and let's talk about themicroservices uh from the abstract senseand I'd like to start by talking aboutwhat microservices are not I'm going togo back to 2000 my early days at Netflixwhen we were a web-based business wherepeople put DVDs in their queue and hadthem shipped out and returned and all ofthat so we had a pretty simpleinfrastructure this was in a data centerHardware based load balancer actuallyvery expensive Hardware that we put putour that we used as our Linux hostsrunning a fairly standard configurationof an Apache reverse proxy and tomcatand this one application that we calledJava web it's kind of everything thatwas in Java that our customers needed toaccess now this was connected directlyto an Oracle database using jdbc whichwas then interconnect with other Oracledatabases using databaselinks the first problem with thisarchitecture was that the codebase forJava web was monolithic in the sensethat everybody was contributing to onecode base that got deployed on a weeklyor bi-weeklybasis and the problem with that was iswhen a change was introduced that causeda problem it was difficult to diagnosewe probably spent well over a weektroubleshooting a slow moving memoryleak took about a day to happen we triedpulling out pieces of code and runningit again to see what would happen andbecause so many changes were rollinginto that one application this took anextended period perod oftime the database was also monolithic ineven a more severe sense it was onepiece of Hardware running one big Oracledatabase that we called the storedatabase and when this went downeverything went down and every year aswe started to get into the holiday Peakwe were scrambling to find bigger andbigger Hardware so that we couldvertically scale thisapplication probably one of the mostpainful pieces from the engineeringperspective other than the outages thatmight have happened was the lack ofagility that we had because everythingwas so deeplyinterconnected we had Direct calls intothe database we had many applicationsdirectly referencing table schemas and Ican remember trying to add a column to atable was a big cross functional projectfor us so this is a great example of hownot to build services today althoughthis was the common pattern back in thelate '90s and early2000s so what is a microservice does uhanybody want to volunte hear theirunderstanding or definition of what amicroservice is sort of curious whatI'll get here somebody some brave soulthere wego what's amicroservice dataown say it again Contex and dataownership context Bound in dataownership I likethat I'm going to give you the MartinFowler definition this is a good placeto start that's definitely a key pieceI'm going to read this to you so youdon't have to microservice architectureStyle is an approach to developing asingle application as a suite of smallServices each running in its own processand commuting with a lightweightmechanis lightweight mechanisms often anHTTP resource API so I think we all knowthis it's it's a somewhat abstractdefinition it's very technically correctbut it doesn't really give you enough ofthe flavor I think of what it means tobuildmicroservices when I think about it Ithink of it as this extreme reaction tothat experience that I had back in 2000with monolithicapplications separ op ation of concernsbeing probably one of the most criticalthings that it encourages modularity theability to encapsulate your datastructures behind something so that youdon't have to deal with all of thiscoordination scalability they tend tolend themselves to horizontal scaling ifyou approach it correctly and workloadpartitioning because it's a distributedsystem you can take your work and breakit out into smaller components whichmake it moremanageable and then of course none ofthis really works well from myperspective unless you're running it ina virtualized and elastic environment itis much much harder to managemicroservices if you're not doing it inthis kind of environment you need to beable to automate your operations as muchas possible and On Demand provisioningis a huge huge benefit that I wouldn'twant to give up without we building thisgoing back to that theme of the humanbody and biology you can think ofmicroservices also as organs in an organsystem and these systems that then cometogether to form the overall organism solet's take a look at the Netflixarchitecture a little bit and see howthatMaps there's a proxy layer that's behindthe elb called Zuul that does dynamicrouting there's a tier that was ourLegacy tier called nccp that supportedour earlier devices plus fundamentalplaybackcapabilities and there's our Netflix APIwhich is our API Gateway that today ispart really core to our modernarchitecture calling out into all of theother services to fulfill requests forcustomers this aggregate set that we'vejust walked through we consider our Edgeservice there's some a few auxiliaryServices as well like DRM that supportthis that are also part of the edge andthen this soup on the right hand side isa combination of middle tier andplatform services that enable theservice to functionoverall to give you a sense of whatthese organs look like these entitieshere are a few examples we have an ABtesting infrastructure and there's an aB service that returns back values ifyou want to know what tests a customershould be in we have a subscriberservice that is called from almosteverything to find out information aboutour customers a recommendation systemthat provides the information necessaryto build the list of movies that getpresented to each customer as a uniqueexperience and then of course there'splatform services that perform the morefundamental capabilities routing to getto to so microservices can find eachother Dynamic configurationcryptographic operations and then ofcourse there's the persistence layers aswell these are the kinds of objects thatlive in thisecosystem now I also want to underscorethat microservices are anabstraction we tend to think of themvery simplistically as here's my nicehorizontally scaled microservice andpeople are going to call me which isgreat if it's that simple but it's it'salmost never that simple at some pointyou need data uh your service is goingto need to pull on data for a variety ofreasons it might be subscriberinformation it might be recommendationsbut that data is typically stored inyour persistencelayer and then for convenience and thisis a really a uh Netflix approach that Ithink many others have embraced butdefinitely specific to Netflix as wellis to start providing client librariesand this were mostly Java based uh soclient libraries uh for doing thosebasic data access uh types ofoperations now at some point as youscale you're probably going to need tofront this with a cache um because theService Plus the database may notperform well enough and so you're goingto have a cash client aswell and then now you need to startthinking about orchestration so I'mgoing to hit the cache first then ifthat fails I need to go to the servicewhich is going to call the databaseit'll return a response back and then ofcourse you want to make sure youbackfill the cach so that it's hot thenext time you call it which might justbe a few millisecondslater now this client library is goingto be embedded within the applicationsthat want to consume your microserviceand so it's important to realize fromtheir perspective this entire set ofTechnologies this whole complexconfiguration is your microservice it'snot this very simple stateless thingwhich is is nice from sort of a pureperspective but it actually has thesesort of complex uh structures tothem so that's the level set onmicroservices and now let's go ahead andlet's dig in on the challenges thatwe've encountered over the last sevenyears and some of the solutions andphilosophies behind thatso I love junk food um and I love thisimage because I think in many cases theproblems and solutions have to do withthe habits that we have and how weapproach microservices and so the goalis to get us to eat more vegetables uhin many cases um we're going to breakthis down into four sort of primaryareas that we're going to investigatethere are four dimensions uh in terms ofhow we address these challengesdependencyscale variance within your architectureand how you introducechange we're going to start withdependencies and I'm going to break thisdown into four use cases withindependencies in service requests this isthe call from microservice A tomicroservice B in order to fulfill somelargerrequests and just as we were talkingabout earlier with the nerve cells andthe conduction everything's great whenit's all working but when it'schallenging it can feel like you'recrossing a vast chasm in the case of aservice calling another service you'vejust taken on a huge Risk by just goingoff process and off your box you couldrun into Network latency and congestionyou could have Hardware failures thatprevent routing of your traffic or theservice you're calling might be in badshape it might have had a bad deploymentand have some kind of logical bugs or itmight not be properly scaled and so itcan simply fail or be very slow and youmight end up timing out when you callit the disaster scenario and we've seenthis more than I'd like to admit is thescenario where you've got one servicethat fails with improper defensesagainst that one service failing it canCascade and take down your entireservice for your members and God forbidyou deployed that bad change out tomultiple regions if you have a multi-region strategy because now you'vereally just got no place to go torecover you just have to fix the probleminplace so to deal with this Netflixcreated histrix which has a few reallynice properties it's got a structuredway for handling timeouts and retries ithas this concept of a fallback so if Ican't call service B can I return somestatic response or something that willallow the customer to continue using theproduct instead of Simply getting anerror and then the other big benefit ofhistrix is isolated thread pools andthis concept of circuitif I keep hammering away at service Band it just keeps failing maybe I shouldstop calling it and fail fast returnthat fall back and wait for it torecover so this has been a greatInnovation for Netflix it's been usedquitebroadly but the fundamental questioncomes in now I've got all my historicsettings in place and I think I've gotit all right but how do you really knowif it's going to work and especially howdo you know it's going to work under atscale the best way to do this going backto our biology theme is inoculationwhere you might take a Dead version of avirus and inject it to develop theantibodies to defend against the liveversion and likewise fault injection inproduction accomplishes the same thingand Netflix created fit the faultinjection test framework in order to dothis you can do synthetic transactionswhich are overridden basically at theaccounter or the device level or you canactually do a percentage of live trafficso once you've determined thateverything works functionallynow you want to put it under load andsee what happens with realcustomers and of course you want to beable to test it no matter how you callthat service whether you call itdirectly whether you call it indirectlyyou want to make sure that your requestsare decorated with the right context sothat you can fail it universally just asif the service was really down inproduction without actually taking itdown so this is all great this is sortof a point-to-pointperspective but imagine now that you'vegot 100 microservices and each one ofthose might have a dependency on otherservices or multiple other servicesthere's a big challenge about how do youconstrain the scope of the testing thatyou need to do so that you're nottesting millions of permutations ofservices calling eachother this is even more important whenyou think about it from an availabilityperspective imagine you've only got 10services in your entire microserviceinfrastructure and each one of them isup for four nines of avail availabilitythat gives you 53 minutes a year thatthat service can bedown now that's great as an availabilitynumber but when you combine them all theaggregate failures that would havehappened throughout that year youactually will end up with three nines ofavailability for your overallservice and that's somewhere in theballpark of between eight and nine hoursa year a bigdifference and so to address thisNetflix defined this concept of criticalmicroservices the one ones that arenecessary to have basic functionalitywork can the customer load the appbrowse and find something to watch itmight just be a list of the most popularmovies hit play and have it actuallywork and so we've taken this approachand identified those Services as a groupand then created fit recipes thatessentially Blacklist all of the otherservices that are not critical and thisway we can actually test this out and wehave tested this for sure short periodsof time in production to make sure thatthe the service actually functions whenall those dependencies go away so thisis a much simpler approach to trying todo all of the point-to-pointinteractions and has actually been verysuccessful for Netflix and findingcriticalerrors so let's now talk about clientlibraries shifting gears completely whenwe first started moving to the cloud wehad some very heated discussions aboutclient libraries there were a bunch offolks uh who had done great work fromYahoo had who had come to Netflix whowere espousing the model of barebonesrest just call the service don't createany client libraries don't deal with allof that um just go Bare Bones and yet atthe same time there are reallycompelling Arguments for building clientlibraries if I have common logic andcommon access patterns for calling myservice and I've got 20 or 30 differentdependencies do I really want everysingle one of those teams writing thesame code or slightly different codeover and over again or do we want toSimply consolidate that down into commonbusiness logic and common accesspatterns and this was so compelling thatthis is actually what wedid now the Big Challenge here is thatthis is a slippery slope back towardshaving a new kind of monolith where nowour API Gateway in this case which mightbe hitting a 100 Services is now runninga lot of code in process that theydidn't write this takes us all the wayback to 2000 running lots of code in thethe same common codeebase it's a lot like a parasiticinfection if you really think about itthis little nasty thing here is not thesize of Godzilla it's not going to takedown Tokyo but it will infest yourintestines it'll attach to your bloodvessels and drink your blood like avampire this is called a hookworm and afull-blown infestation can actually leadto pretty severe anemia and make youweak and likewise client libraries cando all kinds of things that you have noknowledge of that might also weaken yourservice they might consume more Heapthan you expect they might have logicaldefects that cause failures within yourapplication and they might havetransitive dependencies that pull inother libraries that conflict in termsof versions and break your builds andall of this has happened especially withthe API team because they're consumingso many libraries from so manyteams and there's no cut and dry answerhere there's been a lot of discussionabout this it's been somewhatcontroversial even over the last year orso the general consensus has been thoughto try to simplify those librariesthere's not a desire to move all the wayto that barebones rest model but thereis a desire to limit the amount of logicand Heap consumption happening there andyou want to make sure that people havethe ability to make smart thoughtfuldecisions on a case-by Case basis sowe'll see how this all unfolds this issort of an ongoing conversation andmostly I'm bringing up here so all ofyou can be sort of thoughtful aboutthese trade-offs and understand thatnow persistence is something that Ithink Netflix got right early on thereisn't there isn't a war story here abouthow we got it wrong um and let me tellyou how we got it right we got it rightby starting off thinking about the rightconstructs and about cap theorem Iassume how many people are not familiarwith cap theorem I'm just sort ofcurious Okay so we've got a few let's goahead and level set here this is thesimplest definition that that allowed meto get my brain around what this reallywas in the presence of a Networkpartition you must choose betweenconsistency andavailability in this case here you mighthave a service running a network a andit wants to write to databases a copy ofthe same data into into databases thatare running in three different networksor in AWS this might be three differentavailabilityzones the fundamental question is whatdo you do when you can't get to one ormore of them do you just fail and giveback an error or do you write to theones you can get to and then fix it upafterwards Netflix chose the latter andembraced this concept of eventualconsistency where we don't expect everysingle right to be read back immediatelyfrom any one of the sources that we'vewritten the data to and Cassandra doesthis really well and has lots offlexibility so the client might write toonly one node which then orchestratesand writes to multiple nodes and there'sa concept of local Quorum where you cansay I need this many nodes to respondback and say that they've actuallycommitted the change before I'm going toassume that it's written out and thatcould be one node if you really want totake on some risk in terms of thedurability but you're willing to getvery high availability or you can dialit up the other way and say I want it tobe all the nodes that I want to writeto so let's move on I'm just going tobriefly talk about infrastructurebecause there's this is a whole topicuntoitself but at some point yourinfrastructure whether it's AWS orGoogle or things that you've built builtyourself is going to fail the point hereis not not that Amazon can't keep theirservices up they're actually very verygood at it but that everythingfails and the the the mistake if I weregoing to put blame on anybody in termsof what happened in Christmas Eve of2012 when the elb control plane wentdown was that we we put all our eggs inone basket we put them all in Us Eastone and so when there was a failurethere and by the way we've inducedenough of our own to know that this isalso true there was no place to goand so Netflix developed a multi- regionstrategy with three AWS regions suchthat if any one of them failedcompletely we can still push all thetraffic over to the other survivingregions so I did a talk on this earlierin the year uh so I would encourage youto take a look at it if you want to getreally deep into the multi- regionstrategy and all the reasons that itevolved the way that it did um but atthis point I'm going to put a pin inthis I'm going to moveforward so let's talk about scale nowand with scale I'm going to give youthree cases uh the stateless servicescenario the stateful service scenariothese sort of fundamental components andthen the hybrid similar to the diagramthat we were looking at earlier whereit's an orchestrated set of things thatcometogether okay another question what's astatelessservice anybody have an idea want tothrow out their idea their definition ofitah brave soulgood okay that's close that'sinteresting um I start with it's not acach or a database you're not storingmassive amounts of data you willfrequently have frequently accessedmetadata cached in memory so there's thenonvolatile nature of that orconfigurationinformation um typically you won't haveinstance Affinity where you expect acustomer to stick to a particularinstancerepeatedly and the most important thingis that the loss of a node isessentially a non-event it's notsomething that we should spend a lot oftime worrying about and it's it and itrecovers very quickly so you should beable to boot and spin up a new one toreplace a bad node relativelyeasily and the best strategy here is onegoing back to biology is one ofreplication just as with mitosis we cancreate cells on demand our cells areconstantly dying and constantly beingreplenished autoscaling accomplishesthis I'm sure most people are familiarwith autoscaling but I can't underscoreenough how fundamental this is and howmuch this is table Stakes for runningmicroservices in a cloud you've got yourMin and your max you've got a metricyou're using to determine whether youneed to scale up your group and thenwhen you need to have a new instancespun up you simply pull a new image outof S3 and you spin it backup the advantages are several you getcompute efficiency because you'retypically using on demand capacity yournodes get replaced easily and mostimportantly actually is when you gettraffic spikes if you get a DS attack ifyou introduce a performance bugautoscaling allows you to absorb thatchange while you're figuring out whatactually happens so this has saved usmany many times strongly recommend itand then of course you want to make sureit always works by applying chaos chaosmonkey was our very first sort of chaostool and it simply confirms that when anode dies it everything still continuesto work this has been such a non-issuefor Netflix since we've implementedchaos monkey I kind of want to knockwood as I say that um this just doesn'ttake our service down anymore losing anindividual node is is very much thenon-event that we want it to be so let'sjump in let's talk about statefulservices and they are the oppositeobviously of a uh stateless one it isdatabases in caches it is sometimes acustom app and we did this a custom appthat has internal ized caches but oflike large amounts of data and we had aservice tier that did this and as soonas we went multi- region and tried tocome up with generic strategies forreplicating data this was the biggestproblem we had so I strongly recommendyou try to avoid storing your businesslogic and your state all within oneapplication if you can avoid it now inthis case what's meaningful is again theopposite of stateless which is that theloss of a node is a notable event it maytake hours to replace that node and spinup a new one so it is something that youneed to be much more careful about soI'm going to talk about and I'm going tosort of tipping my hand here twodifferent approaches for how we dealtwith caching to sort of underscore thisand again we as I said we had a numberof people who were from Yahoo who wereuh who had experience using ha proxy andSquid caches and a pattern where theyhad dedicated nodes for customers so agiven customer would always hit the samenode for the cache and there was onlyone copy of thatdata the challenge is of course whenthat node goes down you've got a singlepoint of failure and those customerswould be unable to access that servicebut even worse because this was in theearly days we didn't have properhistoric uh settings in place we didn'thave the bulk heading and the separationand isolation of thread pools and so Ican still remember being on a call whereone node went down and all of Netflixwent down along with it it took us threeand a half hours to bring it back up towait for that cash to refill itselfbefore we could fulfill requestsso that's the anti- pattern the singlepoint of failurepattern and going back to biologyredundancy is fundamental we have twokidneys so that if one fails we stillhave another one we have two lungs samething now it does give us increasedcapacity but we can live with only oneof them and just as um your human bodydoes that Netflix has approached anarchitecture using a technology calledevach and evach is essentially a wrapperaround mcash D it is sharted similar tothe squid caches but multiple copies arewritten out to multiple noes so everytime a write happens not only does itwrite it out to multiple nodes but itwrites them into different availabilityzones so it sprays them across andseparates them across the networkpartitions and likewise when we do readsreads are local because you want thatlocal efficiency but the application canfall back to reading across availabilityzones if it needs to to get to thoseother nodes this is a success patternthat has been repeated throughout um EVcache is is uh used by virtually everyservice that needs a cache today uh atNetflix uh and it's been highly usefulto us uh in lots of goodways now let's talk about thecombination of the two this this is thescenario we talked about earlier whereyou've got a hybridservice it's very easy in this case totake EV Cas for granted let me tell youwhy it can handle 30 million requestsper second across the Clusters we havegloballywhich is 2 trillion requests per day itstores hundreds of billions of objectsin tens of thousands of M casd instancesand here's the the biggest win here itconsistently scales in a linear way suchthat requests can be returned within amatter of milliseconds no matter whatthe load is obviously you need to haveenough nodes but it scales really welland uh we had a scenario several yearsago where our subscriber service wasleaning on EVC a little bit too much andthis is another anti pattern worthtalking about it was called by almostevery service I mean everybody wants toknow about the subscriber and you knowwhat's their customer ID and how do I goaccess some other piece of informationit had online and offline calls going tothe same cluster the same evach clusterso batch processes doing recommendationslooking up subscriber information plusthe real-time callPath and in many cases it was calledmultiple times even with the sameapplication within the life cycle of asing single request it was treated as ifyou could freely call the cash as oftenas you wanted to so that at Peak we wereseeing load of 800,000 to a millionrequests per second against the servicetier the fallback was a logical one whenyou were thinking about it from a oneoffperspective I just got a cash Miss letme go call into the service the problemwas the fallback also when the entire EVcash layer went down was still afallback to the service and the databaseand that's the antipattern the service in the databasecouldn't possibly handle the load thatEVC was shouldering and so the rightapproach uh was to fail fast so withthis excessive load we saw EV Cas godown it took down the entire subscriberservice and the solutions were severalthe first thing is is stop hammeringaway at the same set of systems forbatch and realtime do request level caching so you'renot repeatedly calling the same serviceover and over again as if it was freemake that first hit expensive and therest of them free throughout the lifecycle of the request and something wehaven't done yet but will uh very likelydo is embed a secure token within thedevices themselves that they pass withtheir requests so if the subscriberservice is unavailable you can fall backto that data stored in that encryptedtoken it should have enough informationto identify the customer and do thefundamental operations for uh keepingthe service up for that customer theycan get some kind of reasonableexperienceand then of course you want to put thisunder load using chaos exercises usingtools likefit now let's move on and let's talkabout variance this is Variety in yourarchitecture and the more variance youhave the greater your challenges aregoing to be because it increases thecomplexity of the environment you'remanaging I'm going to talk about two usecases one is operational drift thathappens over time the other is theintroduction that we've had recentlyover the last few years of new languagesand containers within ourarchitecture operational drift issomething that's unintentional we don'tdo this on purpose but it does happenquitenaturally drift over time lookssomething like you know setting youralert alert thresholds and keeping thosemaintained because those will changeover time your timeouts and your retrysettings might change maybe you've addeda new batch operation that should takelonger your throughput will likelydegrade over time unless you'reconstantly squeeze testing because asyou add new functionality that's likelyto slow things things down and then youcan also get this drift sort of acrossServices let's say you found a greatpractice for keeping Services up andrunning but only half of your teams haveactually embraced thatpractice so the first time we go andreach out to teams and say hey let's gofigure this out let's go get your alertsall tuned let's do some squeeze testinglet's let's get you all tuned up andmake sure service is going to be highlyreliable and well performant and usuallywe get a pretty enthusiastic response onthat first pass but humans are not verygood at doing this very repetitive sortof manual stuff uh most people wouldrather be doing something else or theyneed to do their day job like go andbuild product for their product managersthe next AB test we need to roll out andso the next time we go we tend not toget that same level of enthusiasm whenwe say hey sorry but you're going toneed to go do thisagain uh you can really take a lessonagain from biology with this concept ofautonomic the the autonomic nervoussystem there's lots of functions thatyour body just takes care of and youdon't have to think about it you don'thave to think about how you digest foodyou don't have to think about breathingor you would die when you fellasleep and likewise you want to makesure you set up an environment where youcan make as many of these best practicessubconscious or not even not requiredfor people to really spend a lot of timethinking about and the way that we'vedone that at Netflix is by building outa cycle of continuous learning andAutomation and typically that learningcomes from some kind of incident we justhad an outage we get people on a call wehopefully alleviate customer pain we doan incident review to make sure that weunderstand what happened and thenimmediately do some kind of remediationhopefully to make sure at leasttactically that that works well but thenwe do some analysis is this a newpattern is there a Best practice that wecan derive from this is this a recurringissue where if we could come up withsome kind of solution it would be veryhighimpact and then of course you want toautomate that where ever possible andthen of course you want to driveadoption to make sure that that getsintegrated this is how knowledge becomescode and gets integrated directly intoyour microservicearchitecture over the years we'veaccumulated a set of these bestpractices we call it production readythis is a checklist and it's a programwithin Netflix virtually every singleone of these has some kind of automationbehind it and a continuous Improvementmodel where we're trying to to make thembetter whether that's having a greatalerting strategy making sure you'reusing Auto scaling using chaos monkey totest out your stateless service doingred black pushes to make sure that youcan roll back quickly and one of thereally important ones staging yourdeployments so that you don't push outbad code to all regionssimultaneously of course all of theseareautomated and now I'm going to jump overI'm going to talk about polyglot andcontainers this is something that's comeabout really just in the last few yearsand this is an intentional form ofvariance these are people peopleconsciously going I want to introducenew technologies into the microservicearchitecture when I first startedmanaging operations engineering aboutthree years ago we came up with thisconstruct of the paved road the paveedroad was a set of sort best breedtechnologies that worked best forNetflix with Automation and integrationsort of baked in so that our developerscould be as agile as possible that ifthey got on the pave Road they weregoing to have a really really efficientexperience we focused on Java and whatI'm now going to call barebones ec2which is a bit of anoxymoron um but basically using ECT asec2 as opposed toContainers while we were building thatout and very proud of ourselves forgetting this working well our internalcustomers our engineering customers weregoing off-road and building out theirown paths started innocuously enoughwith python doing operational work madeperfect sense we had some back officeapplications written in Rubyand then things got sort of interestingwhen our web team said you know we'regoing to abandon the jvm and we'reactually going to rewrite the webapplication in node js that's whenthings got very interesting and then aswe add it in Docker Things become verychallenging now the reasons we did thiswere logical it made a lot of sense toembrace theseTechnologies however things got realwhen we start talking about puttingthese Technologies into the criticalpath for our customers and it actuallymakes a lot of sense to do so let metell youwhy so the API Gateway actually had acapability or has a capability tointegrate groovy scripts that can act asendpoints for the UI teams and they canverion every single one of those scriptsso that as they make changes they candeploy a change out into production thathas a into onto devices out in the fieldand have that sync up with that endpointthat's running within the API Gatewaybut this is another example of themonolith lots of code running in processcess with a lot of variety and peoplewith different understandings of howthat service works and we had situationswhere endpoints got deleted or where thescript or some script went roguegenerated too many versions of somethingand ate up all of the memory availableon the API service so again a monolithicpattern to be avoided and so the logicalsolution is to take those endpoints andpush them out of the API service and inthis case the plan is to move those intonode.js little nodejs applicationsrunning in Dockercontainers and then those would ofcourse call back into the API serviceand now we've got our separation ofconcerns again now we can isolate anybreakage or challenges that areintroduced by those nodeapplications now this doesn't come witha CO come without a cost in fact there'sa rather large cost that comes withthese kinds of changes and so it's veryimportant to be thoughtful about it theUI teams that were using the groovyscripts were used to a very efficientmodel for how they did their developmentthey didn't have to spend a lot of timemanaging the infrastructure they got towrite scripts check them in and theywere done and so trying to replicatethat with a nodejs and Docker containermethodology takes a substantial amountof additionalwork the insight and triage capabilitiesare different if you're running in acontainer and you're asking about howmuch CPU is being consumed or how muchmemory you have to treat thatdifferently you have to have differenttooling and you have to instrument thoseapplications in different ways we have abase Ami that's was pretty generic thatwas used across all of our applicationsnow that's being fragmented out and morespecialized node management is hugethere is no architecture out there or notechnology out there today that we canuse out of the box that allows us tomanage these applications the way thatwe want to in the cloud and so there'san entirely new tier called Titus beingbuilt that allows us to do all theworkload management and the equivalentof autoscaling and node rep placementand all of that so Netflix is making afairly huge investment in that area andthen all the work we did over the yearsrunning in the jvm with our platformcode uh making people efficient byproviding a bunch of services now wehave decisions to make do we duplicatethem do we not provide them and letthose teams running in node have towrite their own direct rest calls andmanage all of that themselves uh sothat's being discussed and there's acertain amount of compromise happeningthere some of the platform functionalityis going to be written natively in nodefor exampleand then of course anytime you introducea new technology into production we sawthis when we move to the cloud we sawthis every time we've done a major rearchitecture you're going to breakthings and they things will break ininteresting and new ways that youhaven't yet encountered and so there's alearning curve before you're actuallygoing to become good atthis and so rather than one pave road wenow have a proliferation of pave roadsand this is a real challenge for theteams that are centralized that that arefinite that are trying to providesupport to the rest of the engineeringorganiz a so we had a big debate aboutthis a few months ago and The Stancewhere we landed was the most importantthing was to make sure that we reallyraised awareness of cost so that whenwe're making these architecturaldecisions people are well informed andthey can make goodchoices we're going to constrain theamount of support and focus primarilystill on jvm but obviously this new usecase of node and doncker is prettycritical and so there's a lot of energygoing into supporting that and then ofcourse logically logically we'd have toprioritize by impact with a finitenumber of people who can work on thesetypes of things and where possible seekreusable Solutions delivery isrelatively generic so you can probablysupport a wide variety of languages andplatforms withdelivery um so that's one example thereone other example is client librariesthat are relatively simple canpotentially be autogenerated so you cancreate a Ruby version and a pythonversion and a Java version so we'reseeking those kinds of solutions againthis is one of those places wherethere's no one cut and dry right way todo this um hopefully this is good foodfor thought if you're dealing with thesekinds ofsituations so let's talk about that lastelement nowchange what we do know is that when wechange when we are in the office when weare making changes in production webreak things this is outages by day ofweek lo and behold on the weekend thingstend to break less here's the reallyinteresting one by time of day 9:00 inthe morning boom time to push changestime to break Netflix soum we know that that happens um and sothe fundamental question here is how doyou achieve velocity but with confidencehow do I move as fast as possible andwithout worrying about breaking thingsall thetime the way that we address that is bycreating a new delivery platform thisreplaced Asgard which was our Workhorsefor many years this new platform was aglobal Cloud management platform butalso a delivery an automated deliverysystem and here's what's really criticalhere spinner was designed to integratebestpractices such that as things aredeploying out into production we canintegrate these Lessons Learned theseautomated uh components directly intothe path for delivery in the pipeline wesee here it's using two things that wevalue highly automated Canary analysiswhere you put a trickle of traffic orsome traffic into a new version of thecode with live production traffic andthen you determine whether or not thenew code is as good or better than theold code and Stage deployment mentswhere you want to make sure you deployuh I'm getting the 5 minute sign youwant to make sure you deploy one regionat a time so that if something breaksyou can go to other regions you can seethe list here of other functions thatare integrated and long term theproduction ready checklist we talkedabout earlier is fodder for a whole widevariety of things that longterm shouldbe integrated into the deliverypipeline I'm cheating a little bit herebecause of time constraints luckily Ican um and I did a talk last yearreinvent that might be of interest toyou if you really want to dig into howthese functions deeply integrate witheach other how does the production readyperformance and reliability chaosengineering integrate with Spiner andcontinuous delivery monitoring systemsEtc so I would encourage you to check itout now I'm going to close this out witha short story about organization andarchitecture in the early days there wasa team called electronic delivery that'swhat actually the first version ofstreaming was called electronic deliverywe didn't have a term streaming backthen in fact originally we were going todo download and had a hard drive in somekind of device and the very firstversion of the Netflix ready deviceplatform looks something like this ithad fundamental capabilities likenetworking capabilities built in theplatform functionality around securityactivation playback and then there was auser interface the user interface wasactually relatively simple at the timeit was using something called a quereader where you'd go to the website andadd something into your queue and thengo to the device and see if it showshowedup what was also nice is this wasdeveloped under one organization whichwas called electronic delivery and sothe client team and the server team wereall one organization so they had thisgreat tight working relationship it wasvery collaborative and the design thatthey had developed or that we haddeveloped was XML pay XML base payloadscustom response codes within those XMLresponses and versioned firmwarereleases that would go out over longCycles now in parallel the Netflix APIwas created for the DVD business to tryand stimulate applications externalapplications that would drive trafficback to Netflix we said let a thousandflowers bloom we hoped that this wouldbe wildly successful it really wasn't itdidn't really generate a huge amount ofvalue to Netflix however the Netflix APIwas well poised to help us out with ourUIInnovation it contained content metadataso all the data about what movies areavailable and could generate lists andit had a generalized rest API Json basedschema HTTP based response codes thisstarting to feel like a more modernarchitecture here and it did Du as anooff security model because that's whatwas required at the time for externalapps that evolved over time to somethingelse but what matters here is that froma device perspective we now hadfragmentation across these two tiers wenow had two Edge Services functioning invery very different ways one was restbase Json ooth the other was RPC XML anda Custom Security mechanism for dealingwithtokens and there was a firewallessentially between these two teams infact because the API originally wasn'tas well scaled as nccp there was a lotof frustration between teams every timeAPI went down my team got called and sothere was some friction there we reallywanted them to be able to get that upand running but this distinction thisunique Services protocols schemassecurity models meant that God forbidyou were a client developer and you hadto span both of these worlds and try toget work done you were switching betweencompletely different contexts and weactually had examples where we wanted tobe able to do things like return limitedduration licenses back with the list ofmovies that were coming back for theuser interface so when I you clickthrough and hit play it wasinstantaneous as opposed to having tomake another roundtrip call to doDRM so because of this I had aconversation with one of the engineers avery senior engineer at Netflix and Iasked him what's the right long-termarchitecture can we do an exercise hereand go figure this out and this is agentleman named out and of course Verythoughtfully the first question he hadto me seconds later was do you careabout the organizational implicationswhat happens if we have to integratethese things what happens we have tobreak the way we dothings well this is very relevant tosomething called Conway'slaw does anybody I'm hearing somelaughter so whoever laughed first uhtell me what Conway's lawis relationship your servicrelationship all right good here's thesort of more sort of uh detailedexplanation organizations which DesignSystems are constrained to producedesigns which are copies of thecommunication structures of theseorganizations they're very abstract Ilike this one a little better any pieceof software reflects the organizationalstructure that produced it here's myfavorite one you have four teams workingon a compiler you'll end up with a fourpasscompiler so Netflix had a forastcompiler uh that's where we were and theproblem with this is this is the tailwagging the dog this is not Solutionsfirst this is organization first thatwas driving the architecture that wehad and when we think about this this isthis is essentially going back to thisillustration we had before we had ourGateway we had nccp which is handlingLegacy devices plus playback support wehad API this was just a mess and so thearchitecture we ended up developing wassomething we call Blade Runner becausewe're talking about the edge servicesand the capabilities of nccp becamedecomposed and integrated directly intothe Zu proxy layer the API Gateway andthat appropriate pieces were pushed outinto new smaller microservices that thathandle more fundamental capabilitieslike security and features aroundplayback like subtitles and dubs andservingmetadata so the Lessons Learned herethis gave us greater capability and itgave us greater agility long term byunifying these things and thinking aboutthe client and what their experience waswere able to produce something much morepowerful and we ended up refactoring theorganization in response I ended upactually moving on my whole team gotfolded under the Netflix API team andthat's when I moved over to operationsengineering and that was the right thingto do for the business Lessons LearnedSolutions first team second and bewilling to make those organizationalchanges so I'm going to briefly recap Ihave zero minutes I'm going to go overjust a couple of minutes uh just so wecan wrap up cleanly here so microservicearchitectures are complex and organicand it's best to think about them thatway and their health depends on adiscipline and about injecting chaosinto that environment on a regular basisfor dependencies you want to use circuitbreakers and fallbacks and apply chaosyou want to have simple clients eventualconsistency and a multi- region failoverstrategy for scale Embrace autoscalingplease it's so simple and it's a greatbenefit reduce single points of failurepartition your workloads have a failurdriven design like embedding requestsand doing request level caching and ofcourse do chaos but again chaos underload to make sure that what you think istrue is actually true for varianceengineer your operations as much aspossible to make thoseautomatic understand and socialize thecost of variance and prioritize thesupport if you have a centralizedorganization and most most organizationsdo prioritize by impact to make surethat you're you're as efficient aspossible on change you want automateddelivery and you want to integrate yourbest practices on a regular basis andagain Solutions first team secondthere's a lot of technologies thatsupport these strategies that Netflixhas open sourced if you're not familiarwith it I think a lot of people are umgo check out NetflixOSS and also check out the Netflix Techblog where there are regularannouncements about how things are doneat Netflix how things are done at scaleannouncements about new open- sourcetools like visceral which is the toolthat generated the visuals we've beenlooking atthroughout and I think we're out of timeat this point um do we have time forquestions or should I just take it outoutside if you can all right well I pushthe limits thank you very much thank youeverybody",
    "summary": "This YouTube video, \"Mastering Chaos - A Netflix Guide to Microservices,\" presents a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions encountered by Netflix in its microservice architecture journey over the past seven years. The presenter, Josh Evans, uses an analogy of the human body's resilience to various threats to illustrate the complexities of a microservice environment. He emphasizes that while microservices offer benefits like modularity, scalability, and workload partitioning, they also introduce significant challenges related to dependencies, scale, variance, and change management.\n\nThe video delves into specific issues like service request failures, client library complexities (a slippery slope towards a new monolith), persistence challenges, and infrastructure failures. Netflix's solutions, such as Hystrix for handling timeouts and retries, FIT for fault injection testing, and a multi-region strategy for disaster recovery, are discussed in detail. The importance of autoscaling for stateless services, redundancy and sharding for stateful services (illustrated by EVcache), and a failure-driven design are highlighted. Furthermore, the talk addresses operational drift, the introduction of new languages and containers (polyglot architecture), and the need for a robust delivery platform like Spinnaker to manage change effectively.\n\nFinally, the video concludes with a discussion on the relationship between organizational structure and architecture, drawing on Conway's Law. Evans argues for a \"solutions first, team second\" approach, advocating for organizational changes to support the desired architecture rather than the other way around. The talk emphasizes continuous learning, automation, and the adoption of best practices through initiatives like \"Production Ready\" checklists. It also points viewers to Netflix's open-source tools (NetflixOSS) and tech blog for further information."

thrivingcareer as it could become the next bigthing so in this ever changing world howshould we decide which language tool orframework we should invest our time inlearning let's talk about that today sobecoming a better engineer is the needof the art and to help you all reach thenext level I have something that youwill find amusing I conduct superpractical courses with a no-nonsenseapproach these courses are designed tohelp you become a better engineer andAce your career the courses willdefinitely reorganite your love forengineering and Spark the much neededengineering curiosity some of my mostpopular courses are of system design anddatabase internals because I operatewith the no fluff approach my coursesare enrolled by folks across all levelsfrom SD ones to tech leads to staff toEMS to VP engineering of some of themost prominent companies out there allthe details about the courses likecurriculum prerequisites testimonialsepic use can be found on the coursepages and I have linked them in thedescription down below so do check themout and I cannot wait to see you allbecome better engineers and as yourengineering career now let's go back tothe video so with limited time andenergy it becomes crucial to makethoughtful decisions about whichTechnologies we would want to invest ourtime in let me talk about a fewstrategies that I have used to make thisdecision first thing first it depends atwhat stage of your career you are atlet's split it into two half first isearly days less than five years ofvertex and second is everything greaterthan 5 years right right now when youare less than five years of work X thisis the time where you have enough timeplus enough energy plus lessresponsibility this is a deadly comboyou have enough time at spare so this isthe time where your curiosity is at itspeak this is the time where you havehigh energy to you know put in effortsinto learning anything and everythingplus this is thewhere you are malleable in learningbecause you just graduated like threefour years after casual you still haveability to learn almost anything thrownat you this is the Time explore anythingand everything that comes your way keepan eye on Hacker News front page keep aneye on what's trending keep an eye onGitHub home feed right you may stumbleupon an interesting repositoryinteresting project interestingtechnology and try to write a simplehello world try to understand what theyare doing differently try to understandwhat makes them different try tounderstand the nuances of it right youhave energy you have time you have lessresponsibility explore now you'd say heybut what should I explore literallyanything and everything don't say no toanything that comes your way becausethis is the time where you can learnanything you at this stage zero to fiveyears of work X you are building a rocksolid foundation for you to be able toswitch verticals and make an informeddecision that hey this is the subdom Iwould want to stick in now where wouldthis help why would you want to learn alot of stuff the idea is crosspollination for examplewhatever work comes your way except thatgo deeper explore technologies thatcomes your way whatever seemsinteresting be it AI beat distributed indistributed storage be it big data beatback-end beat front-end beat mobile thereason I'm saying this is that you don'tknow what you are learning in the firsttwo three four years of your career willcome in handy later stages for examplewhen I completed my masters and joined astartup I was working as a devops SREengineer if I would have said no to thatwhat would have happened later in thestage when I was a engineering leaderwho built a an SRE team ground up Iwould not have been able to do it wellbecause I had that experience becoming aleader leading the SRE vertical was wasnot really difficult right similarlythis is an example of cross pollinationfrom IC to management again from IC toIC let's say you are given a workerlet's say you read an article about SQLquery optimization and you found itamusing right you just scrub your handsaround to see what has happened and howthese folks have done it right you don'tknow you might not be applying thoselearnings today at your work but maybelet's says five years down the line whenyou are writing us when you are writinga distributed spark SQL query you canleverage that same optimization to makethat job better so you allow crosspollination to happen so don't restrainyourself to a couple of Technologies inthe early stages of your career takeyour time explore and then decide thatis the best thing right whatevertrending you see on GitHub Hacker Newsblogs twitters what notjust bookmark them and just revisit themwhenever you find timeremember this as we progress in ourcareer you will not have time to exploreevery new trend that emerges when youare early in your career you have thatluxury so use that wellnow we talked about seniority let's talkabout more than five years of work X sothis is where this is the time where youhave to focus and alignfor example let's say after first fiveyears depending on the kind of work thatyou got you decided to become a back-endengineer this holds true for anythingI'm just taking backend engineering asan exampleso herethis is the phase where you would wantto focus and align so for example ifthere is a new JavaScript uh frameworkthat has come not worthy to put yourtime in because when you become a seniorengineer there is a lot of thingsbecause you are also aging you'll havefamily to take care of you have limitedtime you have put to put a lot of timeat your workplace plus you would haverelatively less energy and because youwould have a Social Circle you wouldhave this that and what not right asenior folks typically like more than uh27 28 a lot of things change right so alot of like time is a scarce a scarcequantity you have very limited of it soyou know where to put itso this is where whatever you arefinding new you typically try to skipwhat is definitely not which definitelydoes not align with your career let'ssay you decided to become a goodback-end engineer so focus on let's sayyou have preferred a particular SEClet's say golang based stack right sowhatever new is coming in in golang yoube updated with that skip Java skipnodes skip rust whatever right skipfront end all together but try to youknow try to uh try to keep it compactwhen I say skip Java or skip node.js itdoes not mean that you totally ignorethem because there might be somethingthat you can piggyback on but so long asit is quote unquote little related toyour work keep an eye otherwise it'sokay to skip rightanother example let's say you havegained experience in let's say big dataso focus on Big Data because it itselfis a big domain right but going inrandom Direction Just because like let'ssay react natives in school let meexplore that or let's say flutters inschool or let's say llvm compilers andadvanced data structures algorithmslet's say radius inteller might not beyour cup of tea right it's okay toexplore occasionally but how much you'dwant to explore totally depends on thetime at spare that you have rightbecausenow comes the reason why why I'm sayingthis why you should be focusing andaligning on few things because as seniorEngineers we are paid a hefty amount bythe organization and we are paid for thedepth we bring in not the breadthbecause breath anyone can build even afresher or even a junior engineer willbe able to do what you are doing if youare just having a high breath but if youhave a solid depth you are bringing inthose expertise that organization needand you can bring in that impact sofocus on building a depth in the thingsand you know explore on those sides soit's like a t-shaped thing that we aretalking about right so whatever newthings coming in whatever new technologyis coming in Focus keep yourthat's why I call this status focus andalign you you judge if whatever you aretrying to put your time in does it alignwith your career trajectory or notI'll give one concrete example let's sayyou are building a lot of golang basedapplications and you can build a lot ofhigh performance stuff so whatever comesaround golang beat low level design bestpractices performance optimizationsgarbage collector tuning whatever itcomes along the way you focus on thatright and in meanwhile anything if I amnot saying that just focus on go butaround the back end you keep your focuson that don't go in random directionsit's okay occasionally to go and explorebut diving deep might not be the bestdecision but it's again it's up to youuh if you still want to explore that dothat but understand what makes orunderstand like the best thing you cando to a career is bring in the necessaryexpertise on the table so that organizesalso that your organization can gain themax out of it and you get paid well forthe expertise that you are bringing inso ask yourself that what are theabsolute must have if you don't want toexplore that particular stuff and focuson that understand the technologicalcurrent job and align yourself with thatbecause the more depth you bring in themore money you'll makeapart from thiseverything you learnsee if it fits into your long-termtrajectory or not that's importantbecause for example if in long term youwould see yourself to be a leader youwould be leading a big engineering teamand let's say you have just put yourfocus on low level implementation willyou be able to Leading will you be ableto deliver projects not really so youneed to you know switch from your ICside bit into management side understandleadership understand project deliveryunderstand how to get your team alignedand what not so whatever you areexposing whatever you are putting yourtime in should be aligned to the careerthat you are envisioning for yourselfand that's really important rightbecause it becomes really tricky tobalance the time between your family andwork and side hustles or rather sideexplorations of technology and whatnotright so spend your time wiselyunderstand where you would want to maketrade-off but once surviving once awhiledo Let Your Heart Out do explore thingsoutside your domain for example compileroptimizations for example distributedstorage for example let's say you mightwant to go into radius internals let'ssay you want to go into databaseinternals let's say you'd want to writeyour own DB do that perfectly fine buthow much you would want to go into thatDeb do you want to pursue it as a careernot sure but first get your careersorted then you have time to spare toyou know explore whatever you want to doon the sitenow that we have split this two thinglet's say you have a plethora of itemsto explore which one would you pick nowhere I have two ways to look at itfirst is the hell yes or no approach forexamplelet's say you are a front-end engineeryou already let's say you know Java uhsorry let's say you know jQuery rightand now there's a new framework that hascome in called react and I'm justbasically taking you back in time I knowit it has been very long that react ishere but I'm just taking you back intime let's say you are Java let's sayyou know jQuery and react is the newthing that has come out now if you are afront-end engineer do you should youspend time exploring react or notthe I the here the key thing isif the current if from the current thingthat you know the new thing that hascome up is 4X better at least 4X bettergo for it spend time learning it becauseit is not an incremental upgrade it is asignificant jump for examplesame thing goes with llms Gen AI thathas come in it's a significantimprovement over it so should you spendtime exploring definitely yesbut on the other hand if let's say youalready know react and there's a newframework that has come in called Viewand you're like hey this seems nicethere's not much difference between themit's not a significant jumpso is it worth putting your time notreally because in case you would everhave to work on view it's not going tobe it no it's not going to be massivelydifficult for you to adopt right sowhich is where you make the decisionthat you should definitely be exploringif it is Forex better otherwise skip itand it should be substantially biggeroutcome for you right and then youchoose to explore what's that in how itdoes it and how to use it and whatnotright sothe way to look at this is it should bethat hell yes I want to do this oreverything else is up and because it'snot worth your time you should befocusing on things that matter and noteverything around yousecond way to look at this thing is isyour learning transferablefor example let's say you are learning aparticular Library let's say you are aback-end engineer and you wrote Pythonand golang for a very long timethen you've heard something called asfunctional programming like should yoube spending time learning functionalprogramming the idea is here you shouldlearn functional programming why becauseanything that you run to write goodfunctional code is transferable to anylanguage you adopt because functionalprogramming is a paradigm you can use itto write functional code in go inJavaScript in Python whichever languagesupports function as its primitive lineright that's the thing whatever you arelearning see if it is transferable letme give another example let's say youwould want to explore distributedstorage let's say you went deeper into aCassandra internals now the learningslike should you go deeper into Cassandrainternals let's say you are into backendengineering you chose to go into thisI would say yes why because if you knowinternals of one distributed databaselet's say Cassandra you can easilycorrelate your learnings into anydistributed database out there becausethey just change a bit here or theremost of your learnings would remainintact it's transferable that's reallyimportant right so similarly on Big Dataif I take an example learning spark willis essential because you can then extendyour learning into fling and hives ofthe world and not it's not thatdifficult like that your learnings canbe transferredand this is how you should be thinkingof how you should be deciding whichtechnology you should be picking upbecause understand this you shouldembrace this fact that you cannot learneverything time is limited and energy islimited we have lots of responsibilityas we grow up so you possibly cannotlearn everything so which is where youdecide which technology to learn andinvest your time in that's important sohow you decide I gave you a small littleframework that I have used to decide itright few things I suggest that I wouldwant to put out is focus on what'srelevant to your current project italigns with your career goals whateverpromises you have made to your careeryou just go there and ensure you chasethat because that's what will help youmake money second is when you decideit's aligning which technology to pickthis is where your approach hell yes orno comes in that either it should be aForex Improvement of what you arecurrently at then you should definitelydo that otherwise just skip it it's okayto say node to an emerging Trend if itis not significantly better than whatyou already know and remember that as adeveloperwhy saying no is important because as adeveloper we are paid to money to solveproblems not to write code writing codeis a way to solve problems if it can bedone with react via adopt view giventhat you know react right similarlyit's and which is why I say it's okay tosay no to a stuff that you know asimilar stuff if you already know aboutit and this is how you should bethinking about it it should besignificant it should be substantialbetter than what you already knowotherwise it's okay to skip it rightand this is how I have approachedthroughout my career on learning andexploring new stuff I am still a personwho likes to have a high breadth becauseI'm very curious at heart it might notsuit everyone but these are some thingsthat I have decided these are the thingsthat I need to be very good at which isback-end development I'm good at it buton the side where it comes to breath Ihave still have a decent breath that Ican talk about compilers distributedsystems distributed storage queryprocessingdatabase internals what not I like to dothat I like no bit of front end alsomobile also infra definitely yes rightbut I have built my depth into buildingapplication to Building Servicesbuilding products solving problems rightso pick a niche that you are good atthat you will be paid for and build andexplore things on the site right andthese are my two cents on the topic howyou should decide which technology tolearn and invest your time in in thespan of your entire career and I hopeyou found it interesting this is mespeaking my heart out on this topic Iused to get discussion a lot so thoughtof making this into a video so I hopeyou found it interesting hope you foundit amusing that's it for this one I'llsee the next one thanksthank you[Music]",
    "summary": "This YouTube video provides guidance on how engineers can effectively decide which technologies to learn, given the constant emergence of new tools and frameworks. The advice is tailored to different career stages. For engineers with less than five years of experience, the video emphasizes exploration, advocating for trying out various technologies, keeping an eye on trends, and allowing for cross-pollination of knowledge. This stage is crucial for building a strong foundation and making informed decisions about specialization later on. The key is to leverage the available time, energy, and lower responsibilities to learn broadly and identify areas of genuine interest.\n\nFor engineers with more than five years of experience, the focus shifts to strategic alignment and depth. With limited time and increased responsibilities, it becomes essential to concentrate learning on technologies that directly support career goals and current projects. The video advises skipping technologies that don't align, even if they are trendy. A key point is that senior engineers are valued for their depth of expertise, not breadth. The video introduces the \"Hell Yes or No\" approach: only invest time in technologies that offer a significant (4x) improvement over existing skills. Also, prioritize learning that is transferable, such as functional programming or distributed system principles, which can be applied across different languages and technologies.\n\nUltimately, the video underscores the importance of making informed decisions about technology learning, balancing exploration with strategic alignment, and understanding that it's impossible to learn everything. The goal is to build expertise that is valuable to the organization and aligns with long-term career aspirations, while still allowing for occasional exploration of other areas of interest. The video concludes by emphasizing that developers are paid to solve problems, not just write code, so focus on technologies that enable effective problem-solving in the chosen domain."

    "transcript": "- The following is a conversation\nwith Michael Paulson,better known online as ThePrimeagen.He is a programmer who has entertainedand inspired millions of people\nto have fun building stuffwith software, whether you're a newbieor a seasoned developer who\nhas been battling it outin the software engineering\ntrenches for decades.In short, ThePrimeagen\nis a legendary programmerand a great human being with\nan inspiring roller coasterof a life story.This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsorsin the description.And now, dear friends,\nhere's ThePrimeagen.What do you love most about programming?What brings you joy when you program?- I can tell you the first timethat I ever felt love in programming,or felt that joy or that excitement-- Sure.\n- Which was in college.It was the second class, data structures,and the teacher that was\nteaching, Ray Babcock,he was talking about linked lists.Now you have to learn Java\nat Montana State Universitywhen I went, and so he's\noff there explainingthis whole linked list thing and all that,and then he shows code.And in the code it's\nlike abstract class nodeor whatever it was, I\ncan't remember what it was.And then it had a private member,and that private member was of type node,and I've never seen that before.It is a class that is called nodewith a member that is of itself.And for the first time ever\nI was like, \"Oh my gosh.\"Like there's no end.There's no way to iterate.\nThis is not a set of 10 items.This is a set of infinite items.And so my mind kind of\nexploded in that moment.Like, there is actually...What you can express is huge.I can see what memory looks like.I can see this hopping through space.And I just remember\nbeing just so blown away,because up until that\npoint, everything was just,all right, I have a list of 10 items.I have a list of 20 items, right?It was very rigid and small,and the things I built were\nreally small and trivial,and all of a sudden I felt\nlike I could build anythingin that one moment.And it was so amazing.I just remember sitting in class for,I don't even rememberhow long those classes were or anything,but I just remember being just completely,like profoundly impacted by this notion.And so I just sat there and I watched,and I had the exact same\nexperience in heaven's forbidby a software engineering class,when we talked about\nthe Decorator pattern,where you can keep on\nconstructing these objectsin this recursive way.Not that I think that's\nactually a good idea to do,but just watching that\nand realizing there'sso many weird and unique\nways you can solve problems,and you can just...Anything your mind can think\nof, you can just create that.And I just remember\ngetting just so excitedabout the possibility\nthat anything is possible.- Yeah, let's wax philosophical\nabout a linked list.It is pretty profound.For people who don't know,\na node in a linked listdoesn't know anything\nabout the world it's in.It only knows about the thing\nit's linked to, its neighbor.Maybe that's symbolic. It's a\nmetaphor for all of us humans.There's billions of us on this planetand we only know about\nour local little network.- Yeah.\n- And it's kind of beautiful.And you realize in that\nlittle simple data structure,you can construct\narbitrarily large systems,and they're like roots\nthat go through memory.And then of course,that's where you get all\nthe programming languagesthat allow you to dump junk into memoryand have memory leaks, and\ntherefore create infinite painas you try to figure out\nwhere that unfreed memory is.For me, yeah, probably...It's so beautiful the way you put that.Linked lists are indeed beautiful.Recursion also for me,when I finally wrapped my brain aroundwhat it means to write\na recursive function.- What was the thing? What\nwas one that taught you?Because I think we all probably...You probably did factorial,where you just do a quick factorial of it.It just doesn't hit home.What was the thing that made it hit home?- I don't remember the first. (chuckles)- I remember my first.How do you not remember\nyour first? It was magic.- I've had so many that just...- I mean, you are a Lisp guy.You're probably pretty\nused to the recursion.- Yeah, all I remember is just surroundedby sea of parentheses.I mean that's really, probably, when I...In high school, I think\nit was either Java or C++.Wow, how do I not remember that?It must have been C++.And then college it was,the generic bullshit software\nengineering classes were Java,but then the renegades, the\ncool kids, were all using Lisp.That's when you're doing the AI,the quote-unquote \"AI\" at\nthat time, that was Lisp.If you want to write a chess\nengine, you would use Lisp.And so for me, probably the\nmoment I really fell in lovewith programming was Lisp,and writing Othello\nprograms and chess engines,all kinds of engines that play a game,and then I could play against that thingand that thing would beat me.The joy of being destroyed\nby the thing you've created.And oh, game of life\ntoo. Cellular automata.That's when I...I built that, you know, all\nkinds of programming languages.That's less about programming languagesand more about the system you create.And that just filled me\nwith infinite joy, having...Now similar to the linked list situation,creating a system where\neach individual cellonly knows about its neighborsand operates in very simple rules.But when you take that system as a wholeand allow it to evolve over time,you can create infinite complexity.So I just...Man, those are many pothead moments,where I'm just looking at\nthe beautiful complexitythat can be created\nwith cellular automata.That filled me with just\ninfinite joy, for sure.But yeah, all I remember is parentheses.So my first, memories\nof my first are drownedin a sea of parentheses.- Oh man, mine is, I have...Well, first off, mine was in Java,so my first was a little bit more rigid,kind of a corporate, you\nknow, a corporate experience.- Yeah.\n- But...- Cold, meaningless.\n- Cold. Yeah.I was in a lab, everyone\nwas using CentOS at that...Or CentOS or however you say.I always called it\nCentOS, the fresh maker.- Yeah.\n- And so it's just likeI'm in this very cold...\n(Lex laughs)- That's nice.\n- Thank you.- Yeah.\n- I'm in this cold,rigid environment with\nmy Microsoft keyboard,programming away in Java.And I still have just such,\nthis memory of despair,because I love programming,\nthis was after the linked list,and I cannot figure out recursion.And so I go to the university\nstore and I buy a bookand it's Deitel and Deitel learn Javaand it has a section, Recursion,so I open it up and I start reading it,and it just doesn't hit home.\nAnd I'm spiraling into this.Like, maybe I'm not a programmer.Maybe I'm not worthy enough to enterinto this circle of\npeople who can figure outwhat the heck recursion means.And Deitel and Deitel's,\nI still remember this,their exact phrase was,\"Every young budding developersolves this recursion program,\"and it was the Tower of Hanoi.And guess what?I don't know if I can solve\nthe Tower of Hanoi to this day.It's a very hard recursive problem.And I just sat there and\nthought, \"Oh my gosh.I'm not going to make it.\"And I sat there in the\nlab for 8 hours, 10 hoursdoing these things, so worried.It's the week of recursion, we\nhave to do a lab assignment.I'm not going to be able to do it.And I just remember being\ngenuinely worried about that.And then, because I always...My big problem was like,\nokay, do factorial.Why not just use a for loop?Okay, what about Fibonacci sequence?Why not use a for loop?I don't understand. What's\nthe purpose of recursion?I don't understand it,\nyet it's so powerful. Why?It looks like a really\ncomplicated for loop.And so I just could not understand it.And then lab came that day and it was,I'm gonna give you a 2D array\nyou have to read from a file.This is what a starting\nposition looks like.This is what an ending\nposition looks like.This is what a wall looks like.I want you to find me a\npath through the maze.So I just sat there like,Okay, well, I guess I can just go upand I can create a visited grid,so I know not to visit\nthese places anymore.And then all of a sudden\nit just started clicking.Like, well, wait a second.I don't know the maze, but if I just goup, right, down, and left,and hop back every time\nI've been to that square,don't visit it, like, I can\njust, it will just go forever.And I realized in that moment,I'm like, I actually understand recur...I've understood recursion this whole time,I just never had a problemin which it actually made sense to use.And that was my big downfall,is that I was measuring my\nunderstanding with the problemsthat I had available, which\nwere just list traversal,which is not a good use of recursion.And so I just remember that freeing...Oh, man. Recursion.It was a great moment in my life.- I mean it does require,\nto be fair, a leap of faith,because people will tell you,those conformist, dogmatic,Java instructors will tell you,that this is important,\nto understand recursion.But it takes a leap of\nfaith that is something,this is a different way\nof looking at the world,and it's a powerful way\nof looking at the world.Actually remembered when I...Think I first...I think I remember my first now.- [ThePrimeagen] All right.(Lex chuckles)- I think it was dev first\nsearch for one of the games.Maybe Othello, something like that,and for that implementing recursion.Understand that you\ncan search trajectoriesthrough the space of states\nand do that recursively?That was mind blowing.Just imagining like...- You can just see it all.\n- The possibilities.Yeah. Just like numbers flying.It was like The Beautiful Mind.And that's when I also\ndiscovered conspiracy theories.(Lex and ThePrimeagen chuckle)That was...And I just saw, I saw the truth.Okay. Yeah.So what were we talking about?Oh, what was the most painful\naspect of programming for you?What memories do you have\nof deep, profound sufferingin terms of programming in the early days?- I would say the biggest one\nthat I can really hold on tohad to be one of two experiences.The first experience waswhen I was at a place\ncalled Schedulicity, and...Am I not allowed to say the place-- You're allowed.There is...- I'm not sure if they're\neven operating stillat this point, but they're in-- There was something funny\nabout the name. I'm sorry.- Oh, Schedulicity? Yeah.Actually, the name was so bad thatwhen you looked at their\npaid-for Google ad termsthat they would make surethat they're at the top of the list,the spellings were just insane,because no one knew how to\nspell the word Schedulicity,and so, it was just like this,the Google optimizing for\nthat is just hilarious.But okay, go back to the thing.The thing that kills me\nthe most about programming,what I actually considered the\nworst aspect of programming,is when you know everything.And so when I was at this job,it's just every single day I'd come in,there were no surprises,\nthere was no questions.I didn't understand the code\nbase, sure, that's fair.I didn't understand all the\nthings about the code base.But I knew I was gonna go in,I was gonna generate some sort\nof object from the database.I was gonna take that\nobject from the database,and I was just gonna map it overand just display it on the webpage.There's no creativity,\nthere's nothing to it.It's very almost factory\nline kind of work.And that was a very difficult\nmoment for me, which is...I didn't enjoy programming,because I knew everything about it.I already knew exactly what\nI was gonna do that day.I knew all the hurdles I\nwas gonna have to go over.There was no unknown\nunknowns, if you will.It was just knowns at all times.And it just, that is...And for me, that is the\nworst part about programming,is when you already know the solutionand it's just a matter\nof how fast you can typeand get it out from\nyour head to your hands.- So the absence of uncertainty,the absence of challenge, was the pain?- Yeah.- That's pretty profound, Prime.- I'm more than just good\nlooks. I want you to know that.(Lex and ThePrimeagen chuckles)- It's a low bar.What do you identify as?I'm enjoying asking the general question.- 38, male.- Male.- Husband of beautiful wife.- Okay.You stream about all kinds of programming,but what kind of programmer are you?Are you full-stack\ndeveloper, web programming?And maybe can you lay outall the different kinds of programmingand then place yourself in\nthat, in terms of your identity.Sexual identity as well.- Yeah, I can get it, we\ncan put it all in there.- Okay.- Plus, obviously those two\nare very, very tightly coupled.- I have seen you on the\nborder of sexually arousedby certain languages.I think you got real\nexcited about OCaml, or...- OCaml. Let's go.Thank you Dillon Mulroy.- Okay, wow.\n- Yeah.- I did not expect that.That escalated quickly. Anyway,\nwhat do you identify as?- Okay, so first let's do the previousor the in-between question first,which is the different archetypes.I think that's a really\ninteresting kind of question,because if you go on\nTwitter or you're new,your thoughts are probablythat there is just web programming,and maybe there's some other stuff,yeah, like game programming,\nbut you'd be like,game programming in\nJavaScript and on the web.There's this very myopic view\nof the programming world,and I bet if you ask a\nlot of people these dayswhat is the most popular\nform of programming,they'd probably say web.If you said what contains\nthe most amount of repos,how many percentage of repos\non GitHub are web-based,they probably say 90% or some huge number.But the reality isthat there's an entire\nembedded robotics world.You know, you're familiar\nwith the ML side of things.There's networking, there's\ngonna be just performance,operating systems, compilers.There's just huge amounts of variationof all these different types\nof programming verticalsthat you can be.And so we often talk about programmingin perspective of web, or\nsomething that's pretty narrow,and I think that's just a\nsocial construct of Twittermore than anything else,that actually I don't believe\nit's that representativeof the entire programming world out there.And I think a lot of\nprogramming's really, really fun.There's some really great stuff.Building your own languageis just a very fun experience to do.Every programmer should just do that once,just to have a completely\ndifferent perspectiveon how things work in life.But as far as what do I do,I've always looked at\nmyself as a tools engineer.So at my time, at my jobs, typicallyI would start off on the\nUI, and then they'd be like,\"Okay, well hey, we need\na library for this thing.\"So then I'd be the one\nwriting the library.So in 2012, 2013, I was\nwriting a UI libraryfor the web that can\nbehave just like an iPad,so you can pinch and zoom on\nit, but it's still a web page.Because we didn't have any\nof that stuff back then.It was a canvas, had to do\nall the matrices operationsand all that stuff to kind of...- Nice.\n- You know, it felt likeyou're on an iPad, but it\nactually wasn't on an iPad.And this was iPad 2 by the way,\nso this is a long time ago.And so every single time I\ngot into a job it's like,\"Okay, hey, we need to do a library.Hey, can you work on a build system?\"So back then there was no\nGrunt, there was no gulp,there was no any of those things,so I had to hand roll my\nown JavaScript build system.And so I always fell into these\npositions of building toolsfor developers to be successful.And I've always really\nenjoyed that region.So as I went on to say\nNetflix, spent 10 years there,I'd say the majority of my\n10 years were building thingsfor developers to usethat they could be\nsuccessful at their job.And so I've always really\nenjoyed that aspect,because your stakeholders and the peoplethat use your program\nunderstand programmingand they're gonna say, \"Hey, I need this.\"And typically the thing that\nthey need, they actually want.Whereas with people, people want stuff,but what they actually need\nversus what they actually wantoften are this weird separation.That's like the old Henry Ford quote,\"I just want a faster horse,\"and he's like, \"No, what\nyou actually want is a car.\"And so it's like, you\nhave to play this gameof trying to really figure it out,whereas developers, it's like,I know, you know what I'm\ndoing, I know what you want.Let's figure it out together.\"- That's actually, that gives youa really nice big-picture view\nof programming in general.So I love the idea of just\nstarting at the interface,like you need to pinch and\nall that kind of stuff,and then figure out the entire thingthat requires to make that happen,including maybe the side quest tooling,how to make it more\nproductive and efficient,all that kind of stuff.So the entirety of the\nthing. That's really cool.Okay, so that mean that\nwould be full stack?By that general definition of\nfull stack, meaning like...- [ThePrimeagen] Perhaps, yeah.- Versus systems engineer,\nlike starting at the bottomand trying to optimize a\ncertain kind of specific thingwithout seeing the big pictureof what the resulting\ninterface would look like.And a lot of people in web programming,they never go beyond the\nfront-end of how a thing looks.They kind of always assume\nthere'll be somebody,some grunt in the shadows,in the darkness of the basement,that will implement the back end.- Some Gilfoyle out therewill be doing the back end.\n- Gilfoyle. Yeah.- Yeah, I like to call\nmyself a generalist,just to give some ideas.At one point at Netflix I\nbuilt the WebSocket connection.So for TVs, how WebSocket\nworks is code I just wrote.And so I built the framing thing,and before that I was\ndoing stuff with memory,and before that I built a UI for a tool.Right? I can just do the thing.You just tell me the thing to doand I'll just go do the\nthing. I worry to...I don't try to get super good\nat one specific activity.I don't want to be a Kubernetes engineer,who's the world's greatest employer,but if I had to go learn Kubernetes,I'd go learn it and learn\nhow to deploy some things,and then hopefully move\non to the next thing,if that makes sense.- I posted about the fact that\nI'm talking to you on Reddit,and there's a lot of wonderful questions.Somebody mentioned that I\nshould ask you about DevOps.Can you explain what DevOps is?Is it a kind of special\nops of programmers,is it SEAL Team Six of developers?What's DevOps? Can you define?Are you a DevOps engineer?- Well, people keep telling\nme DevOps isn't real.There's actually, you\nwant platform engineers,cloud engineers, infra engineers.I just often think the easiest way,if we're doing just\nsome basic nomenclature,it's just DevOps are the\npeople that make surethat when you launch a\nservice and all of that,it doesn't just disappear, right?It's all the backbone\nof being able to operatesomething at scale.Like really don't, if you think about it,if you're just writing\na mom-and-pa website,people that do PHP that are\ndoing WordPress and all that,they're going to build something,they're going to hand\nit off to, I don't know,Linode, DigitalOcean, some company.They don't really need a\nreally complicated build,deployment, all this.It's just someone with a simple websiteso they can sell their goods.And so they don't really need that.And so that's kind of\nhow I think of a DevOps,is when things need to scale,that's kind of the person you hire.- Yeah, those people are actually amazing.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- The time I spent at Google,\nit's like, oh, yeah, yeah,there's all these fancy\nmachine learning people,but the folks that are\nrunning the infrastructure,basically that make sure\nthat shit doesn't go down,they're like wizards,\nand they're essential.- It's a very incredible vertical of job.And obviously I'm using a\nvery broad term to describe,I'm sure, like a bunch...You know, because making\nsure stuff doesn't go down,you could also say that's an SRE, right?Site reliability engineer.Whatever, the ones that wear\nthe bomber jackets at Google.And so when we say DevOps,I think people get very particularabout terms specifically in this category.They're like, \"Well actually,you're mentioning infrastructure engineerversus site reliability engineer.\"It's just like, \"Okay, yes, I hear you,\"but generally when someone thinks DevOps,they think somebody\nthat manages the serversand their life cycles and the reliability.There's DevOps.Is it real? I'm not sure.- [Lex] Okay.- Did Vercel kill DevOps?- Question mark?\n- Question mark.- Yeah. Wow, you're almost a journalist.That's a headline.Let's go back to the beginning.- All right.\n- Baby Prime.So you mentioned Netflix.You've...- Oh, I worked at Netflix by the way.- For people who don't\nknow who ThePrimeagen is,he mentions the fact that\nhe has been very successfuland has worked at Netflix in\nbasically every other sentence.- Correct. Almost as\nmuch as I mention Neovim.- Oh, great. Tell me more about Neovim.No, please don't.So, baby Prime. At the very beginning.You've had one hell of a life,and I think it's inspiring\nto a lot of people.you've come out of that to\nbecome a successful programmerand a person that inspires\na huge number of peopleto get into programming, and\njust to find success in life.So maybe, I would love it if you laid outjust your whole life\njourney from the beginning.- So I guess if we're gonna\nstart with this whole journey,I think it's probably best to start towhen I was about four or five years old.That was the first time I was\never exposed to pornography,and it's kind of just earwormed mefor a large portion of my life.And so I don't think there\nwas a day that didn't go byfrom when I was a very\nyoung lad all the way upuntil I was twenty-some years oldwhere I didn't think about\nporn on the daily basis.And so it was just every\nsingle day, even that young.And so it was just a very\nmind-consuming, time-consuming,thought consuming thing that plagued me,starting at a very young age.When I was seven years old, my dad died.That was kind of a really\ntough period of life.I still think about this time\nthat I went over to China,and there's some rules that we were given,and one of the rules was just like,\"Hey, don't talk about God,and if you do, use the\nword 'Dad' instead.\"And I was just like, \"Okay, Dad!\"It was the first time I\nsaid that word in 17 yearsor some long time.\"Daad.\" It was so weird\nto say that phrase.And I was just like, \"Oh, that\nwas just the strangest thingI've ever said in my entire lifetime.\"It just felt so weird.So, kind of rewind.As I got older, obviously\nwas very good at computers,good at accessing porn, of course,played video games on the Internet.Fun fun kind of side quest story.I think the guy's name\nis Lord Toc on Twitch.I can't quite remember his name,but he built this game\ncalled Graal, G-R-A-A-L,and Graal Online.And when I was a young lad\nit was just like Zelda,except for it also had a level editorand it had a C-like language,and that's how I\ndiscovered how to program,is I looked at these\nsymbols and figured outwhat they meant,and then I was able to make\nthings happen in the game.And that was like a,that's my introduction into programming.So thank you that guy,\nwhatever your Twitch name was.But all right, so keep on going.As I got older, I was super bad socially.I was not a very great social person.High school was brutal,\ngot made fun of a lot,really didn't enjoy, I\nwouldn't say had a great timeduring high school.Definitely felt very out of placeor offset or maybe misplaced, if you will.I'm not sure what the right word is.And so of course at that\npoint, I just always wanted to,I wanted to be accepted,\nto fit in and all that.I did forget to say one side story.After my dad died, my older brother,he started getting into drugs,and along with that he exposed me to pot,so at eight years old I\nwas smoking some marijuanafor a while there, until maybe\n11 or 12, and took a break,and then again did a lot of thatas I got a little bit older, but...So I got a lot of these\nexposures fairly young.16, 15 through 18, lot\nof drinking and all that.When I graduated, or as I\nwas graduating high school,it's just like, I had\nsuch sadness, if you will.I was very sad about how everything went,tried to commit suicide,obviously it was a very poor attempt.And I'm still here today. I'm\nvery happy about that aspect.I'm glad that I didn't\nfollow through with anything,had to go to the hospital and all that.And when I was done, I just still rememberkind of coming out of the hospital,and at that moment it's kind\nof like something broke in you.Have you ever read the book Wheel of Time?It's 14,000 pages or something like that,but right around page 12,000,Rand has to intentionally kill\na girl, the main character.And that's the moment he breaks,and he gets into like Hard Rand,Quindalor Rand, if you will,for those that know Wheel of\nTime will appreciate all that.For those that don't, very\nconfusing, and I understand.Not the Amazon movie show,\nnot that Wheel of Time.So now that we go back onto it,at that point it's just like\nsomething kind of broke in me,and I just didn't care anymore.So all the social\nawkwardness, if you will,all that, just died away with me,but also so did everything else.And so I started using a bunch of drugs.LSD, mushrooms, meth.Did a bunch of meth, did\na bunch of that stuff,and then went off to collegeand continued to do a bunch of stuff.I took too much acid to\nwhere for quite a few years,I had little squigglies\non the side of my eyeswhenever I'd walk by\nhigh contrast objects.And so it's just that whole period of lifewas just kind of marked\nby just poor decisions.And then sometime when I\nwas about 19 years old,somewhere in that range, I\njust had this one eveningwhere I felt the very dramatic\nand real presence of God.And I kind of had this choice,\nlike Frodo, on a razor,where it's like if I go either\nway, I'm going to fall off,and I need to change my life.You get to make the choice now.Do you want to do that or not?And so I remember going, okay,\nI do want to change my life.I don't like this experience.I don't like what I'm\nliving. I am still very sad,I still feel very desperate.I still feel all those things.I'm just pretending to\nbe this other person.And then I just went to sleep that night.Nothing changed in my life.Everything was still the way it was.I woke up the next day, the same person,and I was just like,\"Oh, that's just such a\nstrange, weird experience.\"And I just went about my day.And then I remember, I think that evening,I looked at porn, and all of a suddenI just had a conscious, just\nthis deep, profound shame.And I was like, I've never\nfelt shame in my life.I have no idea what's happening now.And then all of a sudden\nwhen I smoked pot,I just felt deep shame.And when I hurt somebody\nor did something wrong,all of a sudden, it's just\nlike I got a consciousfrom that evening.That's what my gift was, if you will.And just at that point, I\ndidn't even have a choice.I had to change my life,\nbecause for whatever reason,I've been changed in a moment.And so from there I started\nactually trying in school.I always joke around that\nI got 2.14 in high school.I had a teacher hand\nwrite me a note sayingI was the worst student she's ever had.All that kind of stuff. I was\nnot a really great student.And then in that moment it's just like,\"Okay, now life's changed,\"\nand I start trying to learn,and I try to become a good student.And it turns out it's really\nhard. I was really bad.I still got Cs.I went and took pre-calculus\nand failed pre-calculus,and I'm like, \"Oh my gosh, I\nused to be the smart math guy,and now I'm the idiot failing.\"And so I'm just questioning\nmyself and all that,and I spent hours upon\nhours in a studying,math learning center,and then just at some point\nyears into this journey,I'm like a year and a half into\nthis journey, at this point,something clicks, and I go\nfrom being the worst personto just immediately becoming the best.Everything after that is just,\nI don't know what happened.All of a sudden I was\nthe best person at math.I started going into my\ncomputer science classes.I just really got everything.Everything, at just years after trying,just all of a sudden became easier.And I'm not sure if it happened\nover the course of weeksor when the easier started, but\nit was just first predicatedby just a huge amount of difficulty.And then this is where I\nstarted really desiringand loving the process of learning,was when things started getting easierafter all those years.Because I just was motivated\nby this desire to do something,not thinking it was\ngoing to get any easier,and then all of a sudden it\njust started getting easier,and it was great.And that's really where I guess I startedhaving the biggest parts of\nmy life change at that point.I started really, really, really wantingto never look at porn again,because every single time just such shame,and I really wanted to stop.And that was by far the\nhardest addiction to quit.Smoking cigarettes was also a\nreally hard addiction to quit,shockingly hard addiction to quit,but porn by far was just\nthe worst of them all.And then I think about 22,I was finally done with all\nkind of addictions, if you will,and then for a year I\njust worked in all that,and I think right around,maybe it was 21 and three\nquarters, somewhere in that range,I'm not really sure where I\nstopped all the addictions part,but, or at least the outwardly addictions.And then at some point, six\nmonths later, a year later,met my beautiful wife.Things just started falling\nmore and more into place.I loved more and more\nwork. I loved programming.I started programming 12 hours a day.I watched the Social Network\nmovie, and after that,I was just like, \"I'm doing a startup.\"And so that night I\nstarted my first startup,and I was just like, so...It was in PHP by way.- Nice.\n- PHP, yeah, 5.2or something like that.It was great. Great times.And I was just so motivated to do that,and I would just program for...Sometimes I'd program\nfor 24, 36 hours straight, and just nonstop, that's all\nI wanted to do at all points.I think my wife got a little sick of me.She would be like, \"Can\nyou drop me off at school?\"And I'd be like, \"No, I'm programming.\"I was not a very nice...You know, I didn't think\nthrough things that well.- Yeah.\n- I was just so into itand I just did it nonstop,and that's kind of how I became me,is that story, if that makes sense.- Let's try to reverse\nengineer some of the painand some of the triumph.You made it sound easy at times.Let's try to understand it better,maybe when you were seven years old.What do you think about the\npain you've experienced there,losing your dad?What do you think? What kind\nof impact did it have on you?What kind of memories do\nyou have at that time?- The best way I can put it isthat I just never knew what a dad was.I was young enough that\nI could maybe repressor just even have the capabilityof remembering things long-term.Because I know most people\ndon't remember a lotfrom when they're young,\nand so I'm not exactly sure.I probably was at one of\nthe best possible ages,if I'm going to lose a dad,\nto lose a dad, you know?If you're gonna lose\none, if you're 11 or 12,it's a terrible age.That's what my brother was,\nand he fell into drug addictionand never got back out.So I just have more of a fuzzinessand just kind of a longing.I just wish I had a dad.- What impact did that have on\nyour evolution, on your life,having that longing?- I think that's why\nI was so bad socially,in the sense that I was\nlooking for approval, right?I needed approval.I think a lot of people\ndesire that approvalor that loving figure, and\nI just didn't have that.So I think I just looked for\nit in everything else, right?If I were to psychoanalyze my actions.During the time, it's not like\nI was actively thinking that,but yeah, I just always\nwanted something to fill inwhatever that was I felt.- I think a lot of people\nlistening to this will resonatewith your experience in high school.Being the outsider, being picked on,struggling through a lot of\ndifferent complexities at home.What advice would you give to them?- The worst part about high\nschool is that you're surroundedby a bunch of people your\nage and it feels eternal.- [Lex] Yeah.- You don't think...The people that are around you,\nyou feel like are the peoplethat will be there for\nthe rest of your life.At least that's what I thought.And I didn't really even realize thisuntil many years later,\nthat they are going to besome of the least consequential\npeople in your life.- [Lex] Yeah.- Which is very shocking to think about,especially if you're in it right now.- Yeah.\n- Right?Right now they are everything\nthat your experience is,your whole reality.And then one day it all stops,and then real life starts to begin.- Yeah.- That's such a shocking thing,and if I could just tell myself that,maybe I would have been a\nbunch of different person.- That's so beautifully put.I mean, it is like a trial run.You know at the beginning of video games,there's a little tutorial?That's what that is.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- And actually that should\nbe a chance to try shit out,to take risks, because\nreal life will begin with,there is more consequences after that.- Yeah.\n- Here you can,if you like a girl, ask her out.Try, try shit.If you get picked on, hit\nthat guy back. Try shit out.- I'm not gonna condone\npunching another person.- I will. Beat the shit out of him,and take some jiu-jitsu and\nlearn how to take him down.And then that girl that\nrejected you will be like,\"Hmm, maybe I'll give\nthat guy a second chance.\"Be a bad motherfucker. It's\na chance to try stuff out.This is a very motivational\nspeech for kicking ass.- It is true.I mean, there is something\nvery true about that,that I think especially...I mean, I have no ideawhat the girls experience of\nhigh school would be like,but as a guy, there's definitely a lot oflike physical requirements in high school.There's a lot of physical measurement,at least where I grew up.I think that might not be\ntrue in all high schools,but if they're filled with\nboys, it's probably true.And so it's just like,yeah, it probably does\nhelp to do those things,to go to BJJ, to do any\nof these activities.Because even if you don't\never kick someone's ass,just having some level\nof confidence in yourselfis probably a very valuable thing.But just remembering that\nthis is such a short,tiny moment in your life\nis just like a huge help.- I mean, the way you\nphrased it is exactly right.That's what it feels like.That these are the people\nthat will be with youfor the rest of your life\nand this is the whole world.And so that means that there'll bejust tremendous amount of\nimpact if somebody picks on youor if you fall somewhere\nlow in the hierarchyand the status hierarchy\nof this high school,that means you'll be low\nin the status hierarchyof the world and you're fucked\nfor the rest of your life.And that carries a\ntremendous amount of weight.It's just why psychologically\nit's extremely difficultto be...I think it's understated\noften by parents, by society,how difficult it is to be a high schooler,how difficult psychologically it is,how it actually makes\nsense that some peoplewould suffer from depression\nand be on the verge of suicide;is very, very difficult.- Yeah, I think it's even...People always say, \"Back\nin my day,\" blah blah blah.I think it's genuinely harder\ntoday than it's ever beenin the sense that when I was a kid,there was a qualification to people.Meaning, this is a cool\nguy, this is not a cool guy.Today, there's a quantification of people.You have 32,514 people\nfollowing you, you have 12.The people can visually...They can inspect your exact social valueon whatever platform you're on.And that has to be just so much harder.And I can imagine that there's a lot ofjust so much weight to put\non that, that it's just...It feels probably way\nworse and way more damningto be uncool because\nyou have an exact numberof how uncool you are.- Yeah. The challenge there.And the task, the quest is to rememberthat just because your\nsocial circle on social mediaand in high school thinks you're uncool,it actually might mean you are cool.And you need to find that cool and grow itand let it flourish so\nthat when real life begins,you can fucking come out of the gatefiring on all cylinders because-- That's a great way to put it.- I think if anything,\nhigh school is really badat picking out the cool people.Whatever the system, the\nhierarchy that forms,it's such a basic bitch hierarchy.You're good at very generic\nshit. That's how you rise.- Your parents bought\nyou an expensive car.- Expensive car, right?\n- Just-- Materialistic shit. Yeah, exactly.- It's a greedy search.See, they didn't have a proper search,so they're just hitting that local optima.- But the US, I mean, even\nthe objective functionfor that greedy search is\njust a really shitty one,where those people that\nwin the game of high schoolare very often not gonna be the peoplethat win the much more exciting,\nbeautiful game of life.So do epic shit and try stuff out.The weirdos are the ones\nthat are gonna succeed,the weirdos in high school.Probably because they also get bulliedand they get to be tormented\nmore psychologicallyand get to explore their own mindand think through what it\nmeans to be a human being more.Because if you're winning in high school,you're not being challenged,\nyou're not self-reflecting,you're not trying shit out.So there is some degree to being tormentedas long as it doesn't break you.The porn addiction, that's\nanother powerful onethat I think will probably\nresonate with a lot of people.And it's interesting that you saythat's one of the hardest\naddictions to overcome.- Let me say it this way,some addictions have a\nmuch bigger societal lookand porn is just not one of\nthem, which makes it super hard.None of your friends are\ngoing to cheer you on.If you go on Twitter\nand say, \"I quit porn,\"they're going to be like,\"Well, that's good for\nyou but not everybody...\"No one makes that\nargument with meth, right?No one's gonna be like,\"Well, not everyone\nhas to quit meth, okay.It's actually a fine industryand people who are the ones producing it,they're good also, right?\"No one's going to make\nthat kind of argument.Whereas with porn, you're\ngoing to have a whole thingand friends are gonna think\nyou're dumb for doing itor whatever.It's like you have...It's a much more difficult\none in just like that.So it feels accepted.- And I think it's also an\naddiction you can practice,participate in privately\nand hide it from the world.There's certain addictions\nthat are harder to hidefrom the world for\nprolonged periods of time.And porn addiction is\nprobably one you can just havefor many years and then it can deepen.That's probably a serious issue.Boy, am I glad I grew\nup before the internetbecause porn is so accessible,so easy to go deep into that addiction.I mean, what can you speak aboutwhat impact it had on your life?Maybe some of the low points,\nbut also how to overcome it?- I'd say as far as impact goes is thatyou will have such a long\nand broken look at women.By the very, like I can...Again, I'm only speaking\nfrom a male's perspective,that porn in its just most basic thingis that you use another\nperson for your own desireor your own want.It's not something that is deeply needed.There's no need for porn.It's purely a want-based\nactivity or a lust,however you want, whatever\nword you can fill in there.And it is purely an objectifying activity.Someone else is on display\nfor your own enjoyment.And so I think you carry this around.I do think that the women that\nI dated during high schoolor the women after high\nschool and college,I looked at them as a means to an end.And I think porn greatly kind\nof shifted that perspectivein my head that I did not give the valuethat was desired to another person.It really devalues\nhumanity just in general,is my perspective of it.And then it makes people into commodities.And I don't think people are commodities.I think everyone has value.And so during that,for me that's like the\ngreat effect of porn,is that it's just consumerism gone wildor materialism maybe, you\ncould ask or argue, gone wild.And it's extremely hard to\nquit, just like you said,because I can look at porn and\nthen I can go out to lunch.No one's going to know. No\none's going to have any ideas.It's a very private, it\ncan be very short session.It doesn't have to be\nsomething that takes...You can't take acid then\ngo out to lunch, right?Your whole day is going to\nbe a very different day.And so it's very quick, easy, accessible.And then obviously there's all\nthe science and statistics,like men make worse decisions\nfor some period of timeafter looking or being\nexposed to sexualized images.There's the whole dopamine effectthat's just like you constantly\nneed more and more dopamine.That's why people\ntypically don't just watchfive minutes of porn and call it a day.There's like the hundred tab jokethat's always made on the internet.It's because it's just this\nconstant dopamine cycleyou're constantly doing.And all that stuff is great to say.And I'm sure statistics and\nscience and all that stuffis really great arguments\nfor some amount of people.But for me it just comes down to,is it really a good thing to do?Is it really actually something we want,is to value people in such a profaneor just disregarding way?I just really think it's\njust bad for the soul.Even if all the stats\nsaid it was great for you,I still say it's actually bad.- Yeah, you have to look at\nthe long-term big picture,psychological impact it\nhas on your relationshipswith human beings in general.That's my, more generally than just porn,my problem with the quote,\nunquote, sort of \"manosphere\",is I think sleeping with\na bunch of women is great,wonderful.But the problem is,making that the primary\nobjective of your life,similar with porn,is you devalue one of\nthe most awesome things,which is intimacy.That's true for deep friendship,that's true for relationships.And I think porn does that in its purest,darkest form, which is:the thing that matters is the sex,not the deep connection\nwith another human being.And I think, again,\ngoing back to high schooland the manosphere, the objective functionif it's to get laid,which helps with status\nand confidence and all...All that is wonderful, I think.\nAgain, can be an addiction.But the thing that's even more\nawesome for a lot of peopleis a deep friendship or deep intimacywith a romantic partner.That's also fucking awesome,\nand both of those are great.- It's objectively better to have...I would say that there's\nno universe that existsor there should be no\nargument possible that existsthat a guy who has meaningless sexhas a better or a more\nmeaningful life than,say, me and my wife who've\nbeen together for 15 years.We have a very...I can depend on her in all circumstances.Whereas if you live that other\nlife, it sure could be...It could feel great, but\nthere's no meaning to it.There's no actual real value to it.- That's absolutely correct.I do think that getting laidcan have a tremendous positive impacton the confidence of a young man.I think just there's a certain\nnumber of sexual partnersfrom which you can collect a lot of dataand it can free you about,like not to be so nervous\nabout the opposite sex,not to be so nervous\nabout human interaction.And that will allow you to\nsee the world more clearlyand to actually find that one partnerwith whom you can be deeply intimate with.Sometimes the nervousness aroundlike this societally constructed valuein getting laid can cloud your judgment.And if you just release thatby getting laid a bunch of times,then you could see the world clearlythat getting laid is not nearly\nas important as you said,as finding the right human,including I should put in that pile,not just a romantic partner,but friendships, deep lasting friendships.- Well, I mean I think you're rightthat our society puts a lot\nof emphasis on getting laid.And I'm sure that's true\namong any group of malesthroughout any point in history.I'm sure that's a very common jokethat's never actually\nnever stopped at any point.So I'm sure that exists but...And there's probably\nsome truth to the sensethat after you've...Who was it? Jim Carrey.\"I hope that everyone can\nget rich so they realizethat money solves none of your problems.\"The realization that this\nthing that society told youis hyper important is actually\nnot the important part.It is a very important...It's a great sign that your\nrelationship is healthy.Like if me and my wife\nwere to have no sex at allfor months on end, something's gone wrong,which means what...We are no longer on the same plane.But it's not also a good identifier.Just because you're having a lot of sex,it doesn't mean you're\nhaving a good relationship.And so it's like a unique kind of...I forget the right term here,but it's a unique way at\nlooking at the problems.And our society puts so much emphasis.And maybe that's why\nporn was so hard to quit,but my guess is it's just\nall the dopamine effectthat it is.But for me, the most important partand the thing that actually\nhas real reward is having that,having just my wife.I do not look at...I desperately try not to\nlook at any other woman.I'm hopefully not going to get caught...Mark Zuckerberged at the\nWhite House like that.I don't look at porn.My wife has complete confidence in methat there is not going to be a situationin which she has to question\nme in any kind of sense.And that builds a much\nmore deeply, I would argue,a very deep relationshipbecause the trust is that much bigger.I think the deepness of the relationshipis probably proportional\nto the trust you havein each other.It's very hard to have a deep\nrelationship with no trust.- Yeah, and a probably a prerequisite,maybe a component of\ntrust is vulnerabilityto where you take the\nleap of being vulnerablewith another human being.And that vulnerability when reciprocatedbuilds this really strong trustand it's a beautiful thing, yeah.I personally just, given my position,that's even more challenging,being vulnerable with the worldand there's a bunch of people out therethat want to hurt you for it,but I think it's worthwhile\nanyway to be vulnerable.- It's always worth it.The risk is always worth it in some sense.Obviously, everyone has a different lifethey have to filter through\ntheir actions with, right?Because the person that has no,say, social following or anything,their risk reward profile\ncould just be local impact,which could be just as\ndamning or harming to them.- And so it's always\nworth the risk though,in my personal opinion,\nbecause finding my wifehas been obviously the most impactfulor changing thing in my life.Or second most, I'd argue\nthat one night with Godwould probably be the most impactful thingthat led to everything else,but then the wife would be\nthe next most impactful.I mean, I'm cleaning up\nafter myself and stuff now.Changed man. I'm a changed man.- Can we try to reverse engineerthat moment of you finding God.What is it at 19?Because it feels like that was a big leapfor you to escape the pain,to escape the addiction or\nthe beginning of that journey.What do you think happened there?- I think it just felt like I just...There was no line that I\nwasn't willing to cross.Everything was fine and just like...It just all of a sudden,\njust in that moment,it's just like I had I guesssome sort of deep fear\nand understanding likeI am going down a path.Is this really the path\nyou want to go down?And I don't know what the\nresult of that path would beor anything like that.I don't tend to speculate on\nthings I don't understand.I just know that in that\nmoment I had the optionand I just chose...I didn't want it anymore. Right?It's kind of mixed in this whole thingwhere it's just like I had no value.I wrapped up all my meaning or valuein having sex or getting laid.I had, you know...All that stuff, all the\nthings we just talked about,that was where all my worth was.And that is just such a terrible\nplace to have your worth.And it was just all came to a point.And I can't tell you the day of the week,I can't tell you anything\nother than it was nighttimeand I was in South Hedges\nin Montana State University,go Bobcats, meowww...That's about...Yeah, that's the sign that\nwe do at football games.Don't worry about it.But that's all I can really tell youbecause that night was\nno more or less specialthan some other night.It's just the specialness wasI got at least a chance to make a choice.- Because you find in that advicethat you can give to\nothers who are probably,there's probably just an\nendless amount of peoplethat are struggling with porn\naddiction now, young people.What advice could you give\nto them? How to overcome it?- For me to overcome it, I had to realizethat I was taking something\naway from my future wife.Some people would be like,\"Oh, well, once you get a\ngirlfriend then you can stop.\"And it's just like,no, because you never stopped the problem.You don't stop a problem by replacing it.And so I didn't have a girlfriend,\nI didn't have all that.I just realized that I\nwas truly taking awayfrom something from my future wife.And I didn't even know my\ncurrent wife at that time.She was not in the picture.I'm not even sure if she was\nat Montana State Universityat that point.And so it's just that's...Once I made that realization,I think it went from my head to my heart,which they say is the greatest\ndistance in the universe.I finally got it.And that's really where things change.The ability to say likewhat's gonna help you change and all that,I don't know if there's,I don't think there's\nsilver bullets, right?If someone could offer you a drug...I forget who says this phrase,but there's this really interesting phrasethat goes something like.He was a very depressed manand he was struggling with suicideand he writes about this in this memoir.And he goes to these doctorsand the doctors effectively say,\"Well, here's antidepressants,\nit's gonna help you.\"And he says that,\"Well, the problem was is\nthat scientists told methat I could just touch my\nbrain and make myself happy,and that's it.They could reach in, they\ncould configure some stuffand I'll be happy.\"He's like, \"For me, it was a\nlot like going out into a fieldand being able to take\na drug to see the rain.I could look out, see the\nrain, it would fall down,it'd be silvery, it'd be beautiful,but all the crop would still diebecause there's not actually any rain.I had to discover how to be happy myself.\"And so for me, it's like the\nreason why I looked at porn isbecause I was unhappy.I was trying to find meaning.I was trying to find\nvalue in something, right?Something that was\nsupposed to finally give methis ultimate satisfaction.And it just does not, no matter how hard,and no matter how much you think it will,there is no escapade,\nthere is no pornographythat will ever give youthat satisfaction you're looking for.That's the reason why it's addicting.And that's my call to\nwhy you shouldn't do it,but how to get out of it, I\nonly got out of it by realizing.- I think that's really\nbrilliantly described.You knew that this thing\nyou're doing is preventing youfrom finding your future wifeand future wife could\nmean more even broadly,this path to a flourishing,to a beautiful life.I think there's a lot of choices we makethat are just preventing\nus from opening the doorto whatever future.I think what's really\nnice to do is to imagine,just like we said with high school,that there are a bunch\nof trajectories in lifewhere you'll be truly happyand you need to construct\nyour life in a waywhere you have the chance\nto travel down those paths.And there's a bunch of addictions,there's a bunch of choicesthat prevent us from\ntraveling down those paths.So just believe that you're\ngonna have an awesome lifeand remove from your life the thingsthat are preventing you\nfrom walking down that path,which is essentially what you did.It's a leap of faiththat if you let go of porn,that a better life is waiting\nfor you on the other end.- Yeah.I definitely can't say how long\nit will take, a better life.But for me, there's no way in the universeI could have had the\nrelationship that I havewithout first making those stepsbecause I couldn't value my wifein the way that was\nproper for who she was.I would have valued her through the indexor the lens that I currently\nwas looking through, so.- Got to ask.So I've never done meth.I've never done meth.- That was a great segue by the way.(Lex and ThePrimeagen chuckle)- Oh, man. I don't know\nwhat the fuck I'm doing,honestly, with this interviewing thing.But yeah, meth and LSD...I did ayahuasca. I did\nshrooms a bunch of times.And this topic, I should\nsay that there's a lot of,on Twitter and in the\ntech community in general,people speaking negatively about ayahuascaand some positively.I think it's such a roll of the dice.I had incredible experiences,but I don't think I want\nto recommend it to anyone.It's a risk, it's a serious risk.It really is a roll of the dicethat you could meet your demons\nand they could destroy youor you can meet your\ndemons and let go of them.Or you could have experiences\nlike I did, which is never...Apparently I don't have demons.I'm pretty sure they're\nsomewhere in the basement,but I've never met them on drugs.- I'm always really\nhappy. I'm a happy drunk.I'm a super happy on\nayahuasca, just full of love.I don't understand, I don't\nunderstand where the demons are,but that's my biochemistry,\nwhatever that is.And for some others, one\ntrip could be amazingand the next one could\njust completely destroy youand wreck your life.So I don't know what the\nrecommendation from that is,maybe avoid it, but then\nall of us die and life...I tend to lean into\nadventure but drugs is...If you fuck with the\nbiochemistry of your brain,you can really destroy yourself in a waythat it's gonna torment you.So I would generally recommendthat people avoid drugs\naltogether, probably,unless you're a crazy motherfucker.Hunter S. Thompson.- What an intro to this topic.- [Lex] I'm sorry. What's meth like?- That's a great intro.I like...You are very correct in\nthe sense that there is,at least when it comes to hallucinogens,there is a wild variance to\nwhat you're going to experience.And there is no guarantee, there's no...Just because you buy the product,it doesn't mean you're going\nto have a good time, right?There's a lot of...Personally, I find that\nstuff to be very...I believe in the spiritual realm, right?I believe demons and angels\nexist. I believe God exists.And that whole realm is like...I don't know what it opens you up to,but it's much, much different experience.Now, some people will be like,\"Oh, it's just a bunch of\nchemicals in your brain.They all get mixed up.LSD just takes all of your\npathways and they all go...They all get kind of\nscrambled up in your brain.\"And it's just like, yeah,\nthe experiences are profound.I had some really bizarre,\nvery cool, very awful...I've had all the experiences in them all.I can just tell youthat I personally always\nsay the same thing.It's like, choices that I\nmade I can never take back.I would never take that away from myselfbecause I don't know if\nI would be who I am todaywithout all those\nexperiences going up to it.But if you have not had that\nexperience, I'm on your team,or at least partially on your\nteam, maybe more severely,I don't think you need those experiences.I don't think they're gonna...You don't have to put\nyourself through thatto make a good decisions or to realizethat people have value, right?You don't have to do that.So as far as what is meth\nlike? Meth is like...If you've ever done cocaine,cocaine starts off with like\na 15-minute dance party.Just (beatboxing)It's just so intense. It's so great.And then it just followed\nup with like a five hour,just feeling wiggly, right?I don't know how else to describe it.Meth is like thatexcept for I didn't\nget as much dance partyor any dance party, but instead I just gotthat part for like 12 hours.- Yeah.- So did a lot of skateboarding,did a lot of running\naround, staying all night.- Would you say it's a pleasant feelingor is it more like an escapefrom the loneliness of life?Is it pleasant or negativein the actual moment?Not the consequences but in the moment.- So I mean, this is just a\nvery interesting kind of area,which is that not...Universally, you can't say that.Often you'll find that there'skind of these two groups of drug addicts.There's those that like the opioidsand those that like the uppers.They typically don't like...There's very few people in\nthe drug world that do both.They're really just like find\ntheir side and they go for it.So is meth a thing that\neverybody's gonna enjoy?Well, categorically, as you can see,and just how people\nexperience drug addiction, no.But for me it's just I had a really...It kind of feeds into the\nADHD nature of this...Because you know you're\nkind of high energy,you're like always in the moment.So it's just like you're in the moment,but it's just like,\n\"Oh, I'm in the moment!\"Everything's just so intense!You just want to really be in the moment.And so it's just\nexperiencing that constantly.And so was that great?Well, some people...My wife always tells me\nthis, being nervous or...I forget, the anxiety of a situationcan also be the same thing as like thrill.I forget the exact way.She's probably super disappointed\nthat I messed this up.But it's like you could\nperceive those two experiencesin very different lights.Some people get in front of\na crowd and it's thrilling.Some people get in front of itand it's just the worst\nexperience of their lifetime.They would actually literally rather die,which is a crazy thing to think aboutthan stand up and speak.And so for me, meth was\nthat thrilling side,but at the same time,it still didn't quite give\nme that thing I wanted,whatever I was looking for.I'd use it to help try\nto get that thing I want,but it was never giving\nme that thing I wanted.- Yeah. For me, I've had all\nreally wonderful experiences.Do not recommend them.But like with shroom-- That's a YouTube policy by\nthe way that you have to say,\"By the way, do whatever you do,do not do a illegal activity.\"- I-\n- But I had great experiences,but whatever you do, don't do it.- Mr. ThePrimeagen, I have no master.I don't have YouTube or whatever.I'll say whatever the fuck I want.I'm just-\n- But seriously, you do.- No. No.I don't give a shit about\nYouTube or anybody, honestly.I'm just careful about\nthe words I say because,just because I had positive experiences,I don't want young\npeople listening to thisthink they should try the experience.I think the much more powerful message isthat life is awesome even without that.That's something I\ndefinitely experiment withon the alcohol side.So for me, I'm an introvert.\nI'm afraid of the world.Social interaction fills me with anxiety.Alcohol is definitely a thingthat helps with that sometimes,but I think honestly it's\nnot even the alcohol,it's like having to do somethingwhile a person is talking to me.I could just drink a liquid.\"Yeah. Mm-hmm.\" There's a social thing.With a beer, it's like, \"Yeah. Uh-huh.Yeah, we're having fun.\"And I think it's...For me, it works the same as...If the liquid actually looks like alcohol,it does the same purpose\noften because alcohol...If you have a whiskey\nor a beer looking thing,it kind of sends a signal\nthat we should be having fun.So we're socializing, right?We're fucking getting crazy.And then that mean...You don't actually need the alcohol.You can get fucking crazy\nwithout the alcohol substance,but there is some kind of social signalingthat happens when you\nhave a drink in your hand.So I've been to get-togethers\nwhere I'm not drinking,but just doing a fake drink situationand I can also have fun.So I've been...But that said, traveling across\nthe world, there are timeswhen you get to be able\nto down a bottle of vodka.That's very essential for my line of work,but that's almost like\na cultural experienceversus a necessary componentof a successful social interactionand one that brings you happiness.So not drinking...I think you can have\nfun and not drink too.So all of this...Man, I'm so careful saying drugs havehad a good effect on my lifebecause I think for most people,no, for majority of people,they will in the long term\nhave a negative effect.So I think if you were to\nchoose one or the other,just no drugs and no drinkingmeans one day you can bethe President of the United States, kids.And I should say...Oh, man.- That is his funniest line.\n- That means Diet Coke-Diet Coke is great.- That's his funniest line, which is,\"You would hate me if I drank.\"Which I just like...To me, that tickles me\nto no end. Just like,\"Oh my gosh, that is such a funny line.\"- Self-awareness and humor\nis wonderful there, but yeah.- But I am on your team.All of the reasons why I\nused drugs and all that,it's some level of escapism.I'm sure that's like\nwould be the archetypeor the box I'd put that intoor the pursuit of trying to feel somethingthat cannot come from them.It's like trying to find\nmeaning in your job.You can find satisfaction in what you do.That is a very good thing.You can find satisfaction and be happywith what you've created.You can be thrilled by the experience,but you cannot find...I doubt you can find purpose.Maybe some people in specific jobs.This obviously have very broad\nstrokes, I'm painting with.Like if you're an EMT and\nyou save someone's life,maybe there can be purpose in\nthat whole experience, right?So I'm not saying all things,\nbut as programming goes,most programmers, you cannot\njust simply find your purpose.And same with drugs, you cannot findthat thing you're looking for,but they are a very great distraction.And then at some pointthat distraction comes with a heavy cost.I think Dr. Faust would\nprobably know the bestabout the heavy cost, but it's\njust you're making one tradefor another and at some\npoint the bill comes dueand that bill can be very, very large.- The other moment you mentionedthat I think is really inspiringis that you failed pre-calculus.You really struggled in school.You realize that school is really hardand then eventually you're\nable to sort of persevereand, I don't know,break through that wall of struggle.Can you, by way of advice,figure out what happened\nand what kind of adviceyou can give to people who are struggling?- Yeah.I'll paint it in a more clear picture,or a very fast speed run of it is thatI took pre-calculus, failed.I took pre-calculus again, failed,took pre-calculus again and got a C.So I took it three times.Then I took Calc over\nthe summer, so Calc 1.In that one at the end, the final...The final was a two-hour final.I finished it in 30 minutesand that was the highest\nscore in all of the school.And I proceeded to be the highest scorerin all calculus and Diffy Q.I was the only person out of 400 peopleto finish the Diffy Q final.And I got the highest grade.And so I was like, I got really good.So I somehow went from\nreally bad to really good.And my only...The thing that I did is that I had to win.It was not a option.It was not like, \"Oh, this\nwould be really great.\"It's like, \"I will not graduate,I will not finish my stuff\nif I cannot do this.\"And so every single day I got up,I went to my however\nmany hour class it was.Right after that,I went straight to the\nmath learning center,did those problems.When I got home, I just got the bookand it had the odd answers in the back.And I would try to walk\nthrough the problemsover and over and over and over againuntil I absolutely got it.And it just became this\nthing where it's just I...Just simple rote memory took overand the ability to just\neffectively have the times table,but for calculus, all stuck in my head.Inverse trig substitution,\ntrig substitution,doing Taylor and MaClaurin series.All those things, kind of,just over and over and\nover and over again.Eventually they became\neasy. They became very easy.It's just that I had to cram it in there.And some people, you hear these stories,whether they barely show up\nto class and they get As,I've never been that person.I've always been the person\nthat has to sit down,read through everything, and\nI'm bad at abstract concepts.I like the concrete into the abstract,not the abstract into the concrete.Very bad at talking about\nthings theoretically,then trying to apply them.But if I can do it once literally,then it's really easy for\nme to go into the abstract.And so it's just like...For me, it's just I had...There's no substitute for the hours.So if I were to give advice,it's just that you have to\nhave time in the saddle.Hour after hour will\nmake you slowly better.And at first, it's crushing.It's defeating and it's not\nfun because you are bad at it.But then at some point\nyou're just not bad at itif you can just do it long enough,and you'll start getting okay at it.And then at some point you\nmight even get good at it.And when you get good at\nsomething, it feels amazing.There's like an exploratory thing.If you've ever played\na musical instrument,you stop having to think aboutall the little teeny things you have to doto be able to play something correctly.And you start thinking about\nhow you can explore that space.It's like it's a completely\ndifferent problem.And same with programming,programming has an identical\nkind of feel to it.It's just like you'll cross that barrierand it becomes magical\nas opposed to a chore.- Yeah, once you cross that barrier,somehow other things become easier.But then if you want to have\na truly successful life,then you find the next barrier.- Yeah.\n- The next barrier.Yeah, I've always been the same.Everything's come really hard.- Yeah, I've had no free lunches.Everything's just been a lot\nof, a lot of pain and struggle.- I think somebody said\nthat, on this topic,that you think work smarter not harderis a phrase that you dislike.Somebody on Reddit told me this.- Yeah. I don't just dislike it.I hate that phrase.\n- Okay.- Tell me about your\nhatred. How do you feel?- The reason why I dislike that isthat there is kind of a\nhidden suggestion there,which is that you already\nknow what smarter is,so just do that.That actually things should be easy.You should just not have to try that hard.You should just do the\nquick, easy, obvious pathand boom, it's done.It's like I've never experienced\nthat in anything I've done.Everything is actually really hardand most of the time I don't\neven know what I'm doing,so therefore I don't even\nknow what smart looks like.And so for me, the only way I can learnhow to work smart is by\nworking very, very hardand knowing that there's no shortcuts.And then when I finally\nfigure out what smart is,when I work smart and work hard,it is that much better.- I think there's a deep\nprofound truth to that.- There's a lot of these phrasesthat just drive me nuts in our society.- But that one is...Sorry, that one is really acceptedif you can just linger on itbecause it really bothers me as well.So one, which is a really\nnice thing you said,the presumption there\nis things should be easyand you're a failure if you\ndon't see the easy path.That's kind of the implied thing.- Just work smart, daug,why are you putting in all those hours?- And so it makes a lot\nof people that strugglefeel like they're a failure\nbecause I don't see it.And then the choice they\nhave, I'll just go with the...I'll just be lazyand then maybe the profound\ntruth will come to me somehow.And yeah, I don't think I've ever,and I don't think I've met great engineersthat find the smart waywithout the extremely hard work.The annoying thing about\nthose great engineersis then looking back,\nthey forget the hard workbecause they remember all the joythey now are experiencing\nfrom all the efficient,smart work they figured out how to do.They forget...So when they give advice\nthey give the stupid adviceof, well, just do it like the easy way.And here's the easy way.But no, no, no, no, no.You have to put in the hours.Musical instrument is a beautiful exampleof guitar and piano.I've put in, I don't know\nhow many thousands of hours.And now when I'm explaining\nstuff jiu-jitsu as well,I sound like one of those peoplejust relax in jiu-jitsu.By the way, just relax is\na really wonderful thingfor physical endeavors\nlike piano and so on.But to learn how to relax your\nhand, how to relax your mind,your body and usewhatever the biomechanics of your bodyto apply the correct kind of leverageand the timing and all that,that takes thousands of hours of learning.Just to learn how to relax\ntakes a lot of really hard work.In jiu-jitsu that takes many monthsof getting your ass beat over and overuntil you ride the bus home crying.Your ego completely\nshattered and destroyed.And then a little elementis figured out late that\nnight or next morning.And from the depression,\nthere's this little plantthat grows this flower of insight.And you use that insight to\nthen get your ass kicked againall next month and year.And then you grow and grow and grow.And from that you discoverhow beautifully simple\njiu-jitsu is or Judo is,just speaking for myself,\nor piano or guitar.And then yes, the profound truthor the mastery of a skill feels simplewhen you finally arrive to it,but the path for most people\nis going to be a hard one.- I think I should make\nan addendum to the phrase,I think the phrase should\nbe \"Work hard, get smart.\"- Nice. That's a t-shirt.- That's what it should be.- Yeah, agreed.Okay, that was a tangent of a tangent.- Can I say one more\nphrase, cultural phrasethat I absolutely hate?- [Lex] Yes.- \"The journey is better\nthan the destination.\"Everyone's heard this.Just take one second to\napply what that means.That means forever starting from now,you are only going towards\na place that's worse.(Lex laughs)Right? That literally is what it means.- Powww.- Enjoy the journey,\ncelebrate the destination,that should be what it would be but no.People say these phrases,\nthey're everywhere.There's these very shallow phrasesthat have no logical bounds to them.You're just like, what does that,why would the journey ever be\nbetter than the destination?I think this might even\nbe a C.S. Lewis quoteis that C.S. Lewis was like,\nnope, this is terrible.The journey is not in fact\nbetter than the destination.- I love the demotivational posters.\"Progress, moving forward is\nbetter than moving backwardseven if you're still going nowhere.\"There's a lot-(ThePrimeagen chuckles)- I feel that one so\nmuch being in Californiafor a few years, that is painful.- [Lex] Positivity, if it\ndoesn't break you today,don't worry, it will try again tomorrow.It's just a lot of really great posters.- I didn't even know this was a thing.- [Lex] This is a thing.- Oh my gosh, I want that.- Yeah.- Hey. Hi, this is ThePrimeagen.One thing that I forgot to\nmention in this podcast,which feels just so foolish\nto me for forgetting,is just what a big role\nmy mom played in my life.She had to work 18 hours\na day after my dad died.She really made her\nhouse be able to survive.I always looked up to her and\nI always thought her amazing.And she really was the reason whywhen I decided to get my\nbutt kicked back in gear,she's just someone who I looked toas an internal inspiration\nfor me to continuing,to keep on going because I\nreally wanted to make her proud.And all those years of\njust high energy effort,I really wanted to make sure that she knewthat I was just so dang\nappreciative for it.So hey, I just wanted to say thank you.Love you, mom.- For people who don't\nknow, you worked in Netflix.- By the way.\n- By the way.Now, how did you go from there,from the hardship that we mentioned,from the struggle, from\nthe addictions and so onto a place where you were workingat this incredible engineering companyand building cool shit there?So tell the Netflix story.- Yeah, so I kind of alluded to it earlierthat I wanted to do my own startup so for,I forget how long it was, one or two yearsor two and a half years, built a startup.PHP, jQuery,everyone's favorite\nlanguages all put together.You can solve math stuff with jQuery.So I just was totally into\njust non-stop doing that.This is the height of Stack Overflow.I was asking really dumb\nquestions on Stack Overflowlike what is more pythonic?And then you get a bunch of up votesand try to steal a bunch of karma away,all the fun stuff to do.Good times.And I was just so into it breathingand I just breathe it in, breathe it out,and that's what I do all day every day.And so it's just like non-stop\nbuilding of a startup.Ultimately that startup failedand so I had to go get a real job.- Can you say what the startup was?- It is so wild thinking\nabout it in the past.Before I tell you what it is,I want to tell one quick\nthing about my dad.My dad in the early '90s, like '91, '92,was building kind of a phone card companywhere you'd be able to\npre-purchase long-distance minutes.Now, if you remember the '90s\nat about what '97, '98, '99,10-10-220, all those different\nthings down the center,all those companieswhere you can pre-purchase\nlong-distance minuteskind of came out and were very, very big.And so my dad was six\nyears early to that notionand ultimately his startup failed.But he was just really early to somethingthat would catch on really, really bigspecifically in the\ntelecommunication space.Me as I grew up and did my own startup,I did a startup where was\ntext message marketing.This was in 2010 where you could receive,say texts about various\ndeals, all that kind of stuff.And of course, 10 years laternow you don't stop receiving textsand text message\nmarketing is all the rage.And so I also, much like my fatherhad a startup in the telemarketing spacein which was just like\na half decade too early.- So is it fair to sayyou're almost always ahead of your time,that you're a visionary of sorts?- No, in fact, I am not ahead of my time.I just got, some would say I\ngot unlucky on that situation.But it seems so obvious to meat that time when I was doing it,80% of phones were dumb phones.Most people had flip phones.When I went and sold Via Text,is what the name was of\nthat specific product.And we had the short code via text too,so it was pretty clever, six digits.When I went out and sold it,I only had a flip phone during that time.I didn't even have a smartphonebecause they were kind of\nuntenable for a lot of people.So it's kind of just wild\ntimes to think about.But then after that, obviously\nhad to get a real job.We were living in an apartment\nright next to campus,Bozeman, Montana.And the guy below us must've\nbeen on some amount of drugs.He threatened to kill us several times,would just scream and just\nlose his marbles all the time.Very unhinged man, angry\ndownstairs man is what we call him.One time my wife dropped\na battery, double A.Okay, so we're not talking\nabout a B battery or D battery.We're just talking about a double A,drop it, pa, land on the ground,\"I'm going to kill you.\"Like crazy, absolutely\nunhinged behavior down there.So I had to go get a real job,we needed to move out of there.We were gonna start our life.And so I worked at a\nsmall place Schedulicity,which I kind of talked\nabout the boredom there.Got to go to a place called WebFilingswhere I'm working just\ntons and tons of hours.During all that time I'm still tryingto figure out startups.Did one where you couldpre-wish your friend's birthday messages,and then it would automatically send itvia Facebook beforehand.We called it Greet Feed.It was pretty clever.Nonetheless, I say all that storybecause everything that I\nwas doing was exploring,building, finishing things, working,learning about corporate life,learning how to communicate\nin corporate life,being able to be successful at a job,learning about a bunch of\ntechnologies that we're about.And one of the big\ntechnologies during that day,specifically 2013 was RxJS,if you remember that one, RxJS,that's a link from C-sharpkind of ported over to JavaScript.- And for people who don't know,I guess C-sharp, what\nis its closest neighbor?Java, is Java-- They obviously just took Javaand ripped it off at one point,but now it's such a dynamic,\ninteresting languagethat it seems like it\ncould be a really coolbounds of practical versus not practical.It's just I'm not really\ninto wearing pleated pantsand programming at a Microsoft house, so.- Is pleated pants a requirement?- [ThePrimeagen] I think so.- Okay.\n- We'll get back to this.Can we just get back-\n- All right.- Triggering me here.\n- WebFilings.- So anyways, WebFilings was that'swhere I had to do all the\nmatrices stuff and build systemsand just kind of all that.\nAnd it really pushed mebecause they also wanted\nme to do 60 hours a week.It was not very healthy work-life balance.It was very hard work.And kind of that really hard workgoing to cutting edge stuff,\nreally understanding the world,really made it so that I was able tojust be able to talk about\nstuff very commandinglybecause we had to build\nreally complex state machinesfor the UI for what we're building.And so when I went and\nstarted getting a LinkedInand all that, inevitably\njust due to the factthat I've touched all these technologiesand I had some sort of paper trail saying,I've touched these\ntechnologies or Microsoft.Dang it, Lex.- Pleated pants.- Pleated pants reached out.No, Netflix reached out and said,\"Hey, I see you've done\nRxJS. We do a lot of it.You want to come and interview with us?\"And I was always told that\nyou should never rejectkind of a handwritten personal\ninvitation to interview.This was way before bots and even the botswere pretty obvious to\ntell they were bots.This was a manager at\nNetflix, Jeff Wagner,first manager ever.And he just wrote a really\nnice note and just like,\"Hey, I see you're doing\na lot of these things.We really need help with JavaScript.I would love for you to come interview.We're even using a lot of RxJSif you're interested in that.\"And so I was like, all right,\nI can come and I'll interview.And lo and behold, interview went onand I called my wife I think\nhalfway through the interviewand I was just like\ndefeated, absolutely crushedbecause I said...And she might remember this but I said,\"We now have to make a decision.Are we actually going to\nmove to California or not?\"Because I already knew I\nhad the job at that point.I was just knocking them out of the park.I was doing a great job on that.And so I just knew for a fact,\nI'm getting a job at Netflix.There's this thing that people\nalways get so freaked outabout when it comes to\ninterviews and all that.And I luckily somehow avoided this.I don't get test anxiety,\nI don't get any of thatbecause when I go into these situations,my only goal is to show\nthe things I already know.And so it's like I walked\ninto this situation,I've been preparing for\nthis 80 hours a weekfor the last five years.So just walk in and I'm just\nshowing the things I know.And it was perfectly fitting\nfor Netflix at that time periodin the 2013, early JavaScript\ndays on television.And so it was just awesome,\njust worked out perfectly.Got hired there.- So we're in California with Netflix.This is San Francisco.- Los Gatos.So if you're familiar, so\nclassic symbol people dowhich is this is San Francisco, Oakland,San Jose, Los Gatos is\njust like a little bit,kind of a little bit below,\nlittle bit south of San Jose,same mega contiguous city.- Yellowstone is in Montana,\nYellowstone, the show.- Yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah.So is it basically like that,Kevin Costner riding on a horse?Were you riding on a horse to campus?- No, but I love those stereotypes.Actually to be completely\nfair, when I was 15 years old,I was driving around onwhat is now a very busy populated streetshooting gophers out the\nwindow of our car with a 22.So it's like Montana was a different placeat one point than it is today.And there's plenty of parts of Montanathat's still very rural,still kind of more of that old world.So yeah, a little bit, you know,you can get whatever\nyou want from Montana.As far as culturally goes,I'm not really sure the best\nway to put the differencebetween California and Montana.It's just different expectations.One thing I can really\nappreciate about California,or at least when I say California,I mean the Silicon Valley.Because obviously LA\nand the Silicon Valley,very different attitudes,\nvery different mindsets.You can't really compare one to the other.One thing I can say that's\nreally positive about the valleyis that everybody is\noperating on this ideaof trying to build or create something,and there's an energy to\nit that's very exciting.You meet somebody and they have a startupand they're working on the startup.And it's very exciting.And there's a lot of\nnegative aspects to that,and we can all agree that our entire lifebeing commercialized has\nprobably not been that great.But the kind of the\nexperience of being thereand everyone's excited to build something,it's a really cool experience.- Yeah, it's great. It's really great.The excitement, the energy.- Yeah, Montana doesn't have that.- I have an admiration,\na romantic admirationfor the shows like Yellowstone\nbeing out on nature.It's beautiful. I like riding horses.Somebody also said...Reddit is full of wisdom about you.Some of it could be fake news,\nbut something about horsesand this kind of thing.You like horses, you like riding horses?- We have horses on...Our neighbor had much more hilly landand one of the horses broke its leg,so they had to put it down.And so we just said, \"Hey,\nwe are on much flatter land.You can just have your\nhorses in our property.\"And so we just have horses\nthat run around on our...- What about milking cows?Somebody asked about cattle and cow.- So I've only had open cows.If you don't know, cow means girl,open means that, hey, they've\ntried to get the cow pregnant.The cow did not get pregnant first try.And so they're calling that gene,they're getting rid of that gene.The open cow is gonna\nnow go out to pasture,pasture for the year and then get turnedinto delicious T-bone\nsteaks and various things.And so we would house\nopen cows on our property.So no, there's no milking of open cows.- [Lex] Okay.- They'd be very upset if\nyou tried to milk an open cowbecause they're not milking cows.You have to get that cow pregnant.And then once you get it pregnant,you have to kind of put itinto this permanent state\nof milking and all that.And it's a little bit more\ncomplicated than say what we did,which was just cows on eating grassand I didn't have to touch them.- Okay, well, that's wonderful.- Reddit is not a great\nplace for wisdom about me.They're gonna give you\nthe craziest answers.- We'll return to Reddit time\nand time again, my friend.So yeah, you took the leap into Netflix.So what was that like?- It was, you know...This is one of those things\nwhere when you talk about it,people love to trivialize thisbecause it's like, oh,\nyou're taking a leap of faithby going into a FANG company.And in 2013, sounds super risky.My wife was 36 weeks pregnant.We had to travel to a place\nwhere we knew not a soul.We were about to have our first kid.We didn't even have a doctor.If you don't know what having a baby does,you kind of want a\nrelationship with a doctor.There's a whole thing that goes on there.So it was a really hard\nand great experience.So I went to a job in\nwhich their culture deck...So during this time, this\nis where Netflix still hadkind of that old generation X feel to it.Their culture deck was\nhire fast, fire fast.It was very in your face about like,\"Hey, this is how we operate.You don't meet the\nstandards, we kick you out.\"So it's like I'm leaving a placewhere it's more secure to goto a place I don't know anybody,to a job that's bold in its\nclaims about firing everybodywith a wife that's just\nabout to have a baby.And I'm from Montana and\nevery Montanan's bornwith a natural dislike of California.So there's all these things\nkind of flowing into itwhere it's just going to be like,wow, this is a very intense experience.And it was hard for sure.It wasn't just some easy simple experiencethat we were just like, oh,\nwell, I work now at FANG.We had to kind of work through that.Having a kid was very difficult.Our first kid was very difficult.Not having any family\naround to ever help youtook a much larger toll on\nmy wife than me, for sure.- What was the technical\nlearning curve for you?You showed up in your\nplaid pants, dressed up?- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- What did you have to\nlearn about the Stack?Because Netflix, I imagineis this incredible infrastructure.It has to deliver just\na huge amount of data.I'm just blown away by Netflixbut also YouTube.These companies that have to deliver,serve a huge amount of bits.Netflix has it easiest.Out of all the companies Netflix by...Even though you could saymaybe we beat YouTube in view\nhours, I'm not sure if we do,but let's just pretend Netflix has5X more view hours than YouTube.Whatever it is, Netflix has a\nfundamentally easier problemthan all other companies.And let's get back to that.I'm gonna first tell you about the Stack,but I'll tell you why it has a\nfundamentally easier problem.So when I first got there,they gave me my PlayStation three.My boss said, \"Go learn some code.Come back to me in a couple of daysand tell me what you've learned.And then I'm going to start\ngiving you bugs to fix.\"- Wait, wait, PlayStation three,\nwhat are you talking about?- Well, I was on the TV team.I had to go plug in a PlayStationand start launching programs\nonto the PlayStation threeand figure out how to work\nNetflix on a television device.- Oh, so you have\ndifferent kinds of devices.Why PlayStation three, is other different-- It's just 2013. That's what you have.- Any devices that plug into the TV?Okay, cool.- Yeah, not as many TVs had Netflix,let alone what they\ncalled their Darwin app,which is their new application.So if you bought a\nVIZIO earlier that year,you'd get their older one there.It's called Plus UI. You\nget their older version.And so not many had the newer version.We no longer supported Plusor we never actively developed on Plus,we only did stuff on Darwin.And so I had to learn that whole stack,the backend or the middle\nend, the middle layerbetween the actual\nback-end and the front-endwas written in Groovy.And as I went around, Groovy isif you're not familiar with Jenkins,then you've probably never\ninteracted with Groovy.But Groovy is a JVM language.It's a very interesting language,but here's how it got started at Netflix.- Oh, it's Apache.Apache Groovy is a\npowerful object-orientedprogramming language that runson the Java virtual\nmachine released in 2007.It has evolved to become\na versatile languagethat combines both static and\ndynamic typing capabilities.- All right, so the AI\nis kind of lying to you.Groovy is not a powerful great language.That statement makes it seem\nway cooler than it actually is.You'll meet one out of 100\npeople that have touched Groovythat said, \"Oh yeah, Groovy's great.\"The other 99 will be\nlike, \"Heavens forbid,you ever have to touch that language.\"So when I got there, nobody,\nnot a single soul at Netflix,those 40-some engineers had any ideahow Groovy pretty much worked.Somehow people just hacked\ntogether these scriptsand put them all on there and it worked.And this was before there\nwas a Groovy RX port.We wrote our own version called WX.It was a nightmare,\nobservables, all these things.I remember one time they told me that,\"Oh yeah, with RX it's really easy.You just say what you need to do.It maps out and boom, boom, boom,everything will run and all that.\"And I was like, \"Oh wow, really?\"So all I did was go like\nobservable.sleep onebecause I just wanted to see it sleepand then do the next thing.And it turns out when\na thread sleeps itself,no thread can wake it up.And I just turned off all of stagingbecause I ran it like 10 times.Like, oh, it's not responding.\nOh, it's not responding.Oh, now it's not even coming back.Broke all of staging for everybody.So no developer could work\nfor the rest of the afternoonbecause I locked up all the instancesbecause it turns out no, it\nwas in fact not multi-threaded.Every assumption we've been told is a lie.No one had any idea what they were doing.It was a wild time.And so I just simply naturally gravitatedtowards that because I'm\ngood at print off debugging.I'm good at doing those things.So I was like, yeah, I'll\njust figure this out here.I will do this.So I had the rewrite how\nwe do the data structureon the front-end for the TVfrom what is called a LoLoMo,list of list of movies into LoLoRoMo,which is a list of list of\nrecommendation objects for movie.Why would we need to do\nthat? Think about this.You have two lists, one has\nLive Free Die Hard, Bruce Willisbecause you love Bruce Willis.The other one has Live Free Die Hardbecause you want tough\nmen doing tough jobs.Well, during those days\nwe'd only have one waywe could show evidence why you wanted it.So we couldn't say,\"Oh, because you liked this other movie.\"You'd go to that one\nand say the same thing.So we had to add one level of indirectionwhere we could decorate the videowith the recommendation information.- Okay, so you can abstract awayinto the space of recommendationversus the space of movies directly.- Yeah, so you can't hang it off the videobecause obviously then it would\nbe the same for everythingthat shows that same video.- [Lex] That's amazing.- I had to do all this\nand I wrote it in Groovy,and I just did it-- Such a funny name.\n- And people were like,\"How did you write this in Groovy?\"And I was just like, \"Well,\nI read the language referencefor a day and then programmed it.\"Well, what do you mean?It was a very radical\nlanguage, shall we say.And so I just simply became the personthat knew these things,so they just give me more\nand more jobs with that.And so that's kind of how I excelled,being the person that was\nwilling to do the thingthat no one else was.- Yeah. Can you actually speak\nto the print off debugging.You walk into a systemand there's a lot of systems\nin the world like this.Twitter was like this,\nwhen Elon acquired Twitterand the rolls in and there's\nthis old junky code basethat's just like a giant mess,and you have to basically\ndo print off debugging.What's the process of\ngoing into a code baseand figuring out what the fuck?Well, how does this\nwork? What are the flaws?What are the assumptions?You have to reverse engineer\nwhat all these other engineersdid in the past and the messacross the space of months and years,and you have to figure outhow all that works in\norder to make improvements.- The reason why...I've always just been good\nat print off debuggingbecause one of my first kind\nof side quest jobs that I gotwas writing robots for the governmentwhen I was still at school.And so I'd kind of do this contractuallyfor so many hours a week.And my boss, Hunter Lloyd,\ngreat professor by the way,he just said, \"Hey, here's your\ncomputer, here's the robot,here's how you plug it in.Here's how you run the code.Can you write the flash\ndriver, the ethernet driver.Can you write the planetary pancake motor?Here's some manuals, I'm missing some.Just figure it out, I'll be back.\"So that was government work for me.So I was like, okay, I'll\nfigure all these things out.And I figured them all outand the only way to really get\nanything out of the machinewas to print.And so it's like I had\nto become really goodat printing my way through problems.And so that kind of became\nthis skill I guess I adoptedis that I can just kind of print off debugmy way through a lot of these problems.Obviously I'm not a game developer,probably a different world\nprobably should use...I think John Carmack was on hereand talked to how great the\ndebugger is, different world.Because when I was at Netflix,there's machines that\nexist somewhere on AWS,I'm not logged into them.I don't even know how to log into them.I'm not even sure if I have\ncredentials to log into them.They run once somewhere\nand I have to figure outwhat happened and why it's happening.So it's like I'm gonna become...This is what I've trained for.I'm a print off debugging champion.So it's just like I could\njust run through these thingsreally quickly and figure outwhy they're happening the\nway they're happening.- You're a special human.I think that's an\nincredible skill set to haveto be able to drop in into any code base,drop into any situation,\nand do print off debugging.Meaning you're in a dark roomand you're feeling around that roomto try to figure out what the room is.- Well, I had the codeso it's like I can kind of\nblueprint what's happening.I don't understand the\nservices or anything,but you can start guessing pretty quickas to what's going wrong.- Right, but then the print side of thathelps you confirm your intuitions,test your intuitions and build\nup more and more information.And then you start to\naccumulate this bigger picturefrom that, what the edge cases arethat break the system and not.I think that just that kind of space,that kind of situation is intimidatingfor a lot of engineers.They break down at that point.I think it really is a powerful thingto be able to come into a code base,that's generally a skillset of like,very few of us start from scratch.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- And actually this is\nthe fundamental problemof web development and in\ngeneral where they're like,I don't know what's going on.I'm going to write my\nown thing from scratch.As opposed to actually\ndoing print off debuggingon the space of languages,\non the space of problems,because there's a lot of wisdomand solved problems\nalready in this code base.It's a much more important\nskillset to understand,to learn from the mistakes\nand the wisdom of the past,of the ancestors that came beforeand build on them as\nopposed to throw it all outand start from scratch.This is something obviously you see a lotwith a JavaScript framework that comes outand you won every single day.- I have a very great story about that,that this is what I think\nhas shaped me the mostabout my perspective of other devs.There's this dev and he\nalways just wrote thingsin just what I thought was\nsuch a bizarre and weird way,and this had to do with Falcor.So our data fetching library for Netflix.This would run on mobile. So\nI had to write in Objective-C.It had to run on television\nand it had to also run on web.So it ran on everything.And me and one other\nperson were responsiblefor this thing working.And the request sidewhere we'd have to de-dupe the informationthat we already have, the\nrequests that were pendingand the new data. So I\nhad to figure all that outbased on what someone's requesting,and then just only\noptimally request the stuffthat we don't have.He wrote in such a goofy\nway and I'm thinking,man, this guy is just...What a goofball.So I delete it all and I\nstart writing and I'm like,look at how much nicer this is.It's looking so good.I'm like, ooh, there's that one edge case.Okay, I can see why he\nwrote it this one way.That's not a big deal though.The rest of my code's really great.By the end of it, I'm like, I\nliterally almost line for linejust reproduced what he already wrote.It's slightly different towards my style,but I just wrote the same code.I'm like, I'm an idiot.I am the idiot in this situationbecause it was already a solved problem.I just didn't take the\ntime to learn what he did.Instead, I relearned what he didby rewriting the entire thing.- I think that's a skill set\nthat is extremely importantfor people to learn.I see that in myself.That's a constant struggle for myself.When facing a code base, for example,but this applies generally in life,where somebody did a lot\nof work to do a thing,you should invest a huge amount of timeand get really good at\nfiguring out what they did,why they did it.Do a lot of print off debugging\nto understand what they did.It's a much more efficient wayto understand a problem deeply\nthan to start from scratch.Even though there's a constant temptationto start from scratch, because\nstarting from scratch is fun.You do get the puzzle solved\nand all that kind of stuff.It's just not going to\nbe the right thing to do.Usually pain is the right thing to do,and it is for most people painfulto understand other people's code bases.- I highly recommend starting from scratchif you want to understand a concept.You don't know how an HTTP server works,create a TCP socket,\nlearn how to parse HTTP.It'll become very easy and you'll go,this is the reason why\nwhenever I get a request,I have to await the text.I now understand why the text isfor whatever reason not there.I get it. I now understand it.And so you kind of gain\nthese new perspectivesjust by simply parsing something out.- All right. Back to the wisdom of Reddit.Apparently there are memes and legendsabout your programming arc in Netflix.This Falcor system you mentioned,somebody, I think it was Teej,how do you pronounce his name by the way?- [ThePrimeagen] Teej.- Okay, Teej.- TJ would be his name,but we call it Teej or Telescopic Johnson.- Oh wow, so many names.DDoS, distributed denial\nof service attacks,you apparently were ableto accomplish the simplified\nversion of that of just DoS.That's a legend.So you basically broke\ndown the system somehow.- Yeah. Yeah.- Can you tell the story of that?- I'd be glad to.So this Falcor, so there's\nthis Falcor business,and I kind of, I did discover\nthe bug before anybody elseand I did report it to\nsecurity and it was so bad.It actually got its own name,\nRepulsive Grizzly Attack,and they even give\nexamples of how to do it.Effectively what it means\nis that there is a requestthat targets both memory\nand CPU and will destroy.There you go.Look, how Netflix...The next one down was the article\nthat was actually written.I don't get mentioned, which\nis a little bit upsettingconsidering I was the\none that discovered itand told everybody how bad it was.Anyways, and had the right to\nfix for it or the first fix.So this is how it works,is that you can do\nsomething pretty similar,I believe with GraphQL as well.It has the same kind of danger.Any of these kinds of RPC request as muchor as little of the data as\nyou would like frameworks,are vulnerable to this kind of attack.So with Falcor, what you\ndo is you give it an array.That's an array is called a path,and that's the path to the data.But sometimes you don't\nwant to have to write out,I want movie, I want row zeroor list zero or row\nzero column zero title.I want row zero column zero description.You don't want to have\nto write out all that.So instead you could just be like,I want rows zero through 10,columns zero through 10,titles and descriptions.So you can write in a very\ncompact, nice little formatand it'll give you all that data.It'll go to the server.The server will fill that\nall in and give it to you.Oh, dang it, list three, it\nonly had three videos in it.So what happens when I try\nto re-request the data?Well, I need a way to be\nable to tell my systemthat you'd have requested the dataand there's nothing there.So call this like a boxed value.So it's gonna be like\ntype, something, value,there's nothing there.We've already requested it\nand there's nothing there.It's like a sentinel value,\nif you will, a boxed value.And we have this little\nspecial flag weed passcalled materialize.Meaning that when you ask for a path,we will make sure we fill it outso we don't accidentally erase anything.And at the very end we'll say okay,the thing does, the request you've madehas already been made and\nthere's nothing there.Well, what happens if I\nrequest rows 0 through 10,000columns through 10,000,one more item through 10,000and then a whole bunch of propertiesand then ask it to materialize?Well, I'm about to go create\nbillions of objects in the JVM,and what happens to the machine?It stops running.And then if we try to JSON...Even if it could create a 'em all,we then ask it that JSON serialize,it's not gonna do it.It's impossible.And so that was the attack vector,is a simple wild loop would've taken downand held down Netflix\nfor a very long time.Because one request would\nkill one machine on AWS.And so that means it would\njust turn it all off.And this was on the website?This was on TV, this was on mobile.This was profound.And here's the worst part, it\nwas in production for yearsso we couldn't even roll it back.There was no like,\"Oh crap, let's just roll\nback to two weeks agoand we'll fix forward and figure out.\"No, it's like we could roll back to 2011.That's our option is 2011 and that's it.So we had to figure out a\nway forward and all that.And so it was like...The amount of problems\nthat would've happenedif someone would've\ndiscovered this is unstatable.- Just to be clear, the infrastructurethat's serving the videos would shut down.- Yeah, the UI, you couldn't\nperform any actions in the UI.You surprisingly could still stream videobut you would never be able\nto get to a video to stream.Because every action you would takewould be completely shut down.And so it wasn't a DDoSbecause you didn't need a\nbunch of computers to tryto overwhelm the system by\nmaking a bunch of requests,one request, one machine.If we had 50 machines serving\nthe millions of requests,it'd only take 50 requests\nto shut down the entire UI.- Isn't it possible to do DoS or DDoSon basically any software system.Like defending against all the, you know,closing all those attack factorsis probably really difficult.If you take any sufficiently\ncomplicated software system,there's probably so many\nways to overwhelm it.- Yeah, I mean, this is\nwhy people use CloudFlare.I think DHH said it best, which\nis like, we have our websiteand we have a strong\nbodyguard on the outside.So CloudFlare has a bunch\nof utilities all built in.Because obviously this\nis why everyone hatesall these Bluetooth devices\nthat connect to the internetbecause they just turn into attack vectorswhere people use those to\nDoS or DDoS other sites.And so you don't need\nsomething sophisticated,you just need a bunch\nof requests to come inand you can take down websites.And so that's why these\nfronts are really goodat discovering where these problems are.But DoS is a bit different,because it doesn't have to be overwhelmingby using resources with a\nwhole bunch of requests.It really just means simplythat there's a denial of service attack.One of them could be there's\na RegEx attack that existedwhere CloudFlare actually did it to itselfand shut itself down,which is there's a RegEx expansion attackwhere given the right RegEx,if you know someone's\nrunning a specific RegEx,you can actually provide\ninput that is maximally badand that thing goes to super processing.It takes 10 seconds to\nprocess a single request,then you only need to\nmake hundreds of requestsand you shut down the whole service.It's not like you need\nsome giant machineryto make one trillion requests.You only need just some small amountto completely destroy a service.And so there's...The web is an extremely\ndifficult place to do it correct.- This is super fascinating.I do also wonder how many ultra competent,what is it, black hat hackers there are,versus the good guys versus the bad guys.How many bad guys there are\nand what is the average...What is the distribution of\nskillset on the bad guy sidethat are constantly trying to attack?- I assume there's probably a huge numberof just really simple ones,\nscript kitties, right?Just people trying to just do things.And then there's a huge\namount of social engineeringthat just goes in where hacking's\ndone, not with a computerbut just by one of the classic ones.Kevin Mitnick had this\none in his book which was,you'd call up somebody\npretending to be like,\"Charlene, we're doing some auditingand I think your pin's\nout of date on file.Is it 2323, still?\"And they're like, \"No, it's 4747.\"You're like, \"Oh, thanks Sharon.\"Boom. You just hacked him, right?The classic. People love\ncorrecting bad information.This is like a standard.So there's all these ways people hack.And so my assumption isthat there are really\ngreat white hat hackers,there's really great black hat hackers.But the vulnerability space,\nthe harp, the thing is thatdiscovering a vulnerability\nand you don't let anyone know,the white hat hacker still has\nto make that same discovery.And that's where I think the real thing isthat black hat hacking in some sensehas a fundamentally easier jobor at least a job in which\nthey can take advantage offor much longer periods of time.One's the process of discovering\nwho's breaking the system.The other one's trying to figure outhow to break the system.And it seems like most\nsoftware is held togetherby toothpicks and glueand there is a lot of\ndangers in every piece.- And also the social engineering aspect,that's a real attack vector.I think that's the attack\nvector that will doin the longterm the most\ndamage in the world.Especially as AI tooling\nbecomes easier and easierto convince people at scale,sort of do that email Grandma.I think that's a really\nserious attack vector,like human psychology and all that.I assume whenever there's\na girl that approaches me,it's some kind of social\nengineering project,some attack vector, some\nintelligence agency.In fact, I'm pretty sure-- We're back to A\nBeautiful Mind, aren't we?- Beautiful Mind? Yeah.I have a whiteboard upstairs\nthat I calculate everything,everybody's trajectory and move.- You're not wrong though\nwith the attack vector,especially in the day of AI.One thing that I don't\nthink a lot of peopleare talking about as we\nintegrate more and more AIis that prompt injectionis an extremely hard\nthing to defend againstbecause it's not really clear\nhow you defend against it.If it's just a, at the end of the dayword calculator make word come out.If you can figure out the\nproper word calculator input,it might just break its boundsand start doing something\nit's not supposed to do.And there's a whole future word.There's all these products\nthat are going to be vulnerableto things they never thought about.It's one thing where\nyou forget an edge casewhile you're programming.Now you have to guess what\npeople might be able to think ofmaking something that has access\nto a system be able to do.And you don't have a\nway to reason about it.Its reasoning came from\nReddit, and other wordsthat it's read and how\nto put things together.This is a very...It's a massive space\nthat's gonna be happening.It's why I'm personally thinkingdon't give too many powers yet.We don't know the attacks\nthat are about to happen.- Yeah, the more power we\ngive to software systems,the more damage they can do.That certainly is the case.But the more awesome they could do,and that's the knife's\nedge that we all walk alongas a human civilization\ntogether, hand in hand.Will we flourish or destroy\nourselves? Question mark.Folks on Reddit, the good folks on Reddit,demanded that I ask you about\nthe time you broke production.Is this related to Falcor?Did you break production?Is this fake news?\n- I've broke productionquite a few times.I've broken productions\nfor so many stupid reasons.One time I broke productionbecause I came up in the PHP.And PHP Static means static\nfor the lifetime of the PHPand PHP was the lifetime\nof every request, right?That's why PHP was so inefficientwas that every request\nwas its own instance,and therefore static memory\nwas for the lifetime.I guess I never put that together.And so I had some objects\nthat I made staticbecause I was like, oh I just need thisfor the lifetime of the request.And lo and behold, those weren't lifetime.A whole bunch of bad data\ngot all over the place.People were showing up saying they werefrom all these different countriesand everything was all\nwrong because I just...Whoopsie-daisies. I just made\na whole conundrum with that.So that was one time I did it.Another time is I took down,if you were on the homepage\non the website waitingfor Lady Gaga's video to come outand you were watching\nthe countdown go down,if it reached zero,the billboard would freeze\nand it wouldn't work.If you refreshed it, it would work.But the reveal, (chuckles)the big reveal, I screwed that upand my boss got real upset\nand so did other peoplein Hollywood got upset about that one.That was like a, \"My bad.\nSorry, Jeff Wagner, again.\"I remember that one. I\nremember that one specifically.One time I released a bug\nwhere again on the billboard,if you pressed add to my list,I accidentally programmed\nin an infinite loop,and your whole webpage would just freeze.- Are some of these bugs\ndifficult to discoveruntil you started-- That one seems really\neasy looking back at it.- [Lex] Infinite loop? Yeah.- And we actually, during\nthose days we had manual QAthat are supposed to\ngo through everything.So I didn't feel as badbecause my manual QA\ncounterpart also missed it.We all missed it. But\nit was just so simple.Just press that button, boom.It just completely freezes the website.- Polluting the code with global variablesthat are holding values,SPHP I think allows you to do,that's a tricky one to discover,because you rely on it,then there could be somebody\nelse assigns a value to it.- Yeah, it's a data race everywhere.And I just didn't understand...In my head static was like,\n\"Oh, this is for the life.\"I was just so locked into\nthe PHP world at that timethat I just made just such a,looking back on it's so obvious.But during the time, it's hard.- So in general, pushing to production,I talked to Pieter Levels about this.He, I mean, obvious he's operatingas mostly a solo developer, but\nhe often on the website saidthousands, not, hundreds\nof thousands of people use.He often ships to production,pushes to production,\nmeaning just no testing,just like push to fix.What are the pros and\ncons of that approachin general to you?What do you think?- It's obviously much easierthe smaller your organization is.I think no one would argue that sentiment.If it's just you working\non a singular project,it is obviously much easier\nfor you to push directlyto production because you\nare the only one working.You know all the ins and outsand if something were to\nbreak, you would discover it.So to me that makes sense.I think the way he operates\nis perfect for what he does.You couldn't take what he does\nand move it to say Microsoftor Netflix or Google because\nthat would obviously...It would just be a disaster,just due to the amount of people\nall pushing to production.And so I personally love that.I think that you have to gaugeboth the application you're\nbuilding and its complexityand what you're pushing,and how many people are working on it.I think those all go\ninto how you can do that.Because not all applications\nare created equal either.That application I was making\nwas zooming and scrollingwhere we had all of our own everything.It was a very deep heavy logic app,and that was regardless\nof what was happeningon the website, most of\nthe code was library code.And that becomes way harderif you don't have a good\ntest suite and stuff to runbefore you push it out.Because when you squeeze that ball,different things come popping\nout in different areas.And that's a very harder problem than sayif you're doing more of a heavy visual onebecause a heavy visual one,you're affecting just this\none area's visual stuffand you can test it and\nthat's normally the end of it.Whereas, you know...So it depends on the\ncoupling and everything.So I love his approach by the way.I have such mad respect for\nanyone that operates that waybecause I think is a great\nway, it just is so goodbecause it breaks this notion\nthat tech Twitter has that,oh, well, you have to use\nall these expensive services,you need to use all these thingsbecause if you don't use all this stuff,if you're not using the\nlatest version of React,if you're not using the\nlatest version of this,you're simply not going\nto make it as a startup.It's impossible.And it's just like, no,\nno, that's not software.Most of software isn't the new stuff.Most of software is old crappy softwarethat someone has to maintain,and it actually is really, really greatand has lots of really hard problems.And if you look at it differently,\nit's actually fantastic.- For people who don't\nknow his tech stack,in terms of web development\nis PHP, jQuery and SQL.- Yeah, all great stuff.I'm just surprised he still uses jQueryjust given the fact that at\nthis point on the modern web,everything is, I mean, you\nhave document query selectorand ad event listener click, right?It pretty much has\neverything you already need.It had DOM content load,all the reasons I used\njQuery back in the day wasadding a click on a button was hard.You had to deal with IE7, IE8, IE9.Those are hard differences.Whereas now, it's just so easy.I'm just surprised it's even that.- That's definitely a trade-off I have,I still use the exact same stack,PHP, jQuery and different flavors of SQL.But the question there is,you keep using jQuerybecause you can get the\njob done really fastand there's no significant\nperformance hit that you detect.So like why swish to something else?But it's always probably,\nas we'll talk about,good to explore and to learn.- Not all tools are great\nat solving all problems.And so what you think is really...The problem is you run\ninto this trade off,which is you have some tool beltthat you're very adept with,you know all the ins and outs.There's no unknown unknowns,but there's no surprises in this.You know what you're building,you know what you're getting into.You will go through and you'll\nbe able to solve the problem.But if you ever use a different languageor a different experience,you can find that some things are ableto represent states way easier,\nin a way more efficient way.And you can solve problems\nreally efficientlyin some versus the other.And so it's like, if\nyou don't take the timeto explore as well, you\ncould be missing outon something that makes you twice as goodon this one specific problem like subset.And so I value being able\nto look at all problems.And so I don't want to\nget stuck on one thing,though, I see why people do,which is for the efficiency sake.- Let's just return to the\ninfrastructure of the platformof Netflix and, speak more generally,Netflix, Twitch, YouTube.Anytime I use any of these\nservices, I'm just blown awayby the infrastructure it\ntakes to deliver this service.YouTube and Twitch are\nunique, versus Netflixwhere the creators can roll in\nthemselves and upload stuff.So on the consumption side,YouTube has over 100 billion views a day,over one billion hours watch time.But on the creator side,one million hours of videos\nare uploaded every day.One million hours.It's like you have to service bothand you have to deliver everything.It's just incredible to me.Can you maybe speak to your own intuition,just zooming out on it,what it takes to deliver\nthat kind of infrastructure?- For me, the thing that\nI find vastly complicatedand I can't imagine the engineering hours,is how do you even create\nan edge in that situation?And what I mean by an edge,when people say this phrase,\nif you're unexperienced,an edge is where you deliver data.You want that edge to be\nas close to the customeras possible because that's\nwhere the data lives.And then the communication\nbetween the customerand what you're doing\nis really, really small.Obviously the speed of light adds up,the amount of hops adds\nup, the amount of servicesthat you have to remotely call adds up.They all add up and they\nall add inefficienciesto the system.So something like YouTube,they want to be able to serve that dataas quick as possible, but\ntheir data changes constantlyand relevance is almost directly tiedwith the newness of the item.So it's like how do you\neven cache these things out?How are you doing this?So they must have such an\nincredible caching networkthat I can't even...I can't even fathom what\nit takes to do that.That just to me is just so impressive.A million view hours in how\nmany different resolutionswith how much data?What is a million view hours?Is it 4K million view\nhours, along with 1080p,along with 720p, along with 1440p?That number is an insane number.- Actually, it is brilliant what you said,which is for YouTube often the new thingis extremely important\nto show to everybody.And so, you can't rely on cachingor trivial kind of caching.- Yeah.\n- You have to deliverthe new thing as quickly as possible.Yeah, I mean, it's incredible.So there's the entire system,\nthe recommendation systemthat knows each individual\nhuman watching YouTubeand it has to integrate\ninto that the new thing,while also caching this incredible clusterof possible videos that you're\npotentially interested in.And integrate into that adsin the case of YouTube and so on.- It's a really tough problem\nbecause you have to thinkwhat is the cash hit rate on this?Because the problem now\nactually comes down to space,space actually becomes a real problem.How many hundreds of\npetabytes do they havethat they have for like,\n\"Okay, what do we cacheand where do we cache this?\"The number, I think in\nthe terms of gigabytesor maybe megabytes, they\nhave to think in probablyversions of bytes I don't\neven know the name for right?It's such a different problem\nand that's why I said Netflix.Netflix has a much easier\njob when it comes to caching.So if you've never looked\nit up, it's called OCAand that we know what\nvideos we're releasing,we know what videos are\nhot in specific areas.It's a very limited set.We're not going to all of a sudden get,\"Oopsies, we got a\nmillion new view hours.\"We don't even have to worry\nabout that as a problem.So it's like, \"Okay, we know\nStranger Things season five'sabout to drop, we're gonna\npre-cash Stranger Thingsseason five in every\nsingle OCA across the worldbecause that thing's\nabout to get hammered.\"And so it's like it's able to dosuch a different decision-making\nthan what you have to dowith something like YouTube.And then Twitch is even more wildbecause now you're\nactually ingesting videoand trying to make it go out\nall at the exact same timefor all video and you have\nto transform that videofrom whatever format and\nwhatever the bit rate isinto something that's more efficientin the system like that.Hats off to Twitch engineering,because that's some serious work.- And here's some asshole, Lex,coming out and tweeting\nabout YouTube features.So like, (chuckles)Listen...- You're not wrong on the\nfeatures you asked for, though.- I think this is an engineering problemof how do you allow fast\niteration and addition of featuresthat shouldn't have to be integratedor impact the whole code base.So at the edges of the code base improveon certain features,\nwithout having to consultthe mothership of the code.- It's the large team, right?That's the fundamental problem.When you get into YouTube size,there is the team/organizationthat deals with data warehousing.There's the team/organization\nthat deals with delivery.There's a team/organization\nthat's like the middle layer,how you even...They're gonna be like\nthe little micro-surfacesto talk to these places.Then you have this front-end engine...So for a small feature, you\nhave to get middle team,you have to get back-end team,you have to get all these things.Quick example, Netflix.Are you familiar with the\ndystopian, Black Mirror?- Yeah.- Okay. Season one, episode one.Do you know season one, episode one?Everyone who watches Black Mirrortypically knows this episode.- Okay, yeah. I don't remember what it is.- Forgive my language,but they call it the pig-fucker episode.- Oh yeah, of course.- [ThePrimeagen] Once\nyou've seen the episode,you will then know this episode.Well, when Netflix adopted\nit, I got pulled into a room,there's like a VP, a\nVP, a product designer,a VP, and they said,hey, we're about to releaseour own version of Black Mirror,season three, I think at that time.We need episode one, season oneto not be the first thing people see.So let's just reverse the season order.That required me...I had like 20 engineers\nI had to gather togetherto be able to have this happen.And that's just the\nproblem of big companiesis that eventually every little thinghas to become its own team.And so even small...There's no such thing as a small feature.- Reversing the order of the dropdownthat selects the seasons is a meetingwith a bunch of VPs and engineers.That's really interesting.- Yeah.- There's got to be a\nway to accelerate that.The natural scaling of a\ncompany and the bureaucracythat grows, yes, slows that down.But just having seen Elon work a lot,his teams are able to\nstill keep it very fast,even as the company grows.There's got to be a process to doing that,especially for,yeah, for the pig-fucker episode.I don't know where that's\nin the priority list,but for important things like that,you should be able to do that quickly.I don't know. Can you speak\nto how would you do that?- Well, I can tell first how it was done.Remember, so at a place like\nNetflix, there would be...I think that at that point it's called,a product called Dexter.I can't remember.There's our actual\nmovie metadata warehousethat's gonna be highly\nintegrated with Hollywood,that's gonna be, where that\nside is able to manage all that.So I'm like, \"Hey, you need\nthe ability to mark thingsthat need to be reversedbecause we're gonna\nrun into this a bunch.\"And we did.We ran into quite a few topical showsthat all need to be reversed and all that.And so it's like,\"We need to be able to\nreverse episode numbers,season numbers.We need to be able to hide\nseason or episode numbers.\"Like in the case of the\nChelsea Handler Show,it was like a daily show, so it's likeyou don't need episode numbers,you just need the latest one.And so there's this whole\nproblem that exists.And so it's like, okay,\nyou need to work on thatfor your UI over there,then you need to be\nable to store that data.Then we need to be able\nto go to the peoplethat can actually get the\nvideo data out of thatand provide it to our service layer.I need to go talk to\nthem and convince themthey need to be able to\ngive me the new methodsand everything to do that.Then I need to be able\nto go write the methodsto get it down, and then\nI need to go to the UIand make that accessible.Now I need to go to the website people,I need to go to the mobile people,I need to go to the TV people.And so it's like...\n- Yeah.- You can see this thing like snowballing.And for us, the big thing that\nNetflix did that was so wellis after I met with these\npeople that were high level,I was the captain. \"I'm the captain now.\"So I went to all these teams and said,\"Hey manager, I need an engineer.We need to get this done within\nthe next couple of monthsbecause we got Black Mirror coming out.\"So she would go, \"Okay, here you go.\"The map team, I need someone to help mewith being able to get data\nout of the LoLoMo for this.And so it's like, \"All right,you're working with this engineering.\"I'd go to the BMS team,\n\"Okay, I need this engineer.\"I'd go to the billboard\nteam, \"I need this engineer.\"I go to all these little placesto get all these little pieces of data.And then I was the captain, I was like,\"You're working on\nthis, you're doing this,you're doing this, you're\ndoing this, I'm doing this.Let's go.\"And so it's like that worked.And we were able to go pretty\nfast for a big company.And the fact that it required 20 engineersto do such a simple task,\nwe were able to do it in,gosh, I'd say about three\nweeks worth of effort.But that was still...I thought that was amazing, comparatively,to how many people move.- Well, because you have the\nfreedom of the agency to do it.You said the captain of the\nship. That's really powerful.For big companies, that's a risk.Because you can fuck it up.You might not see the bigger\ncontext legally or any,the bigger context of the\nimpact on the industryor all the contracts\nthat are made, all that.So it's a risk, it's a risk,but it's a risk you have to keep taking.And then when you fuck up, you fix,and then maybe pay the cost\nlegally for that, whatever.But the long term, that risk pays offbecause you're going to\nkeep creating a betterand better product, evolving\nwhere the industry is going,constantly innovating ahead\nof where the industry is goingand so on.Yeah.- And not only that, I think one thingthat is just so important is that,yes, the product will get better,but the people that you hireand the people that you\nkeep around are betterbecause they're the\nones that show maturity.They're the ones that can just...You give them something and\nthey can rally the troopsand make something happen.That's a very great\ngroup of people to hire.And so you also naturally\nselect out great engineersthat aren't just simply good at coding,they're good at coding and\nthey're good at explainingand they're good at\nconvincing, and they're good...And you have to create\na very lean audiencethat can move fast.- And I think for great\nengineers, having to waitfor like, \"Okay, let's schedule\na meeting for next Wednesdaywith the VPs and...\"That destroys their soul.And they either don't\nwant to contribute anymoreor they leave the companies\nor they just tune outand take the golden handcuffsand just buy a nice house\nand focus on a family.- And I feel like I\nwould die under that...Honestly, that is my death sentence iswhere it's just that\nthere's no reason to try,there's no reason to do anything.I'm just gonna go in there,effectively zombie through\nmy day and call it...I don't want to live like that.I want to feel like I'm\ntrying to do something.- I should also mention on top of that,so you've brilliantly laid outhow incredible the challenge\nthat Netflix has to solve.On top of that with YouTube,the metadata thing,because users are able to\nupload video and there's an APIwhere they can upload automaticallyand change all this kind\nof stuff automatically.Every one of those things\nis an attack vector,as we mentioned.That's something they\nhave to consider seriouslyon the engineering side.And on the legal side,they can get into trouble\nall kinds of ways.So they have to consider all\nof that, which is fascinating.- The legal side is obvious,\nbut it's not really like...I would never have initially\nthought someone would,say, upload images that you're\nnot allowed to own or have.But that guarantee you that happens.Then you have the whole kid side, right?I think about when you mark\nsomething as kid-friendly,how many times have they snuck porninto a Taylor Swift video or whatever?That was like a few years back,there was that whole\nTaylor Swift or whatever.I forget what it was, I\nthought it was Taylor Swift.But there'd be these mock videosthat'd come up and then, boom.It's like, that is such an awful problemand I'm so happy that is not a problemI have to try to figure out.- Yep. Okay.So yes, YouTube and Twitch and Netflixare doing an incredible job.You eventually chose,the madman you are, to leave Netflixand to start on a new journeyof being a wolf pack of\none, start streaming.What was that? What was the story of that?- So I was streaming for\nalmost seven years now.It started actually at Netflix.We did a charity, Extra Life,shout out to Extra Life for\nstarting my streaming career,effectively is just you stream\nand whatever money you raise,it goes to Kids with Cancer research.They are a great charity in the sensethat they take no overheadand they raise their own donationsfor their website and everything.And so it's a very great,\nstraightforward charity.Really love what they've done.It was super cool because\nI live in South Dakota now,but I actually could\nchoose a hospital directlywhere the money goes to.So there's a direct impact from A to B.So it's a pretty cool organization.And so my friend, Guy Cirino, Nice Try Guyis what I like to call him,he was probably the\nsingle greatest engineerI've ever met in my lifetime.And he was just like, \"Hey, come do this.We're going to all do\nthis.\" So I played Fortnite.And so before I did that, I was like,oh, I better learn how to stream first.I better get affiliated so\nI can take subscriptions.And then if anyone\ngives me a subscription,I'll also pay that forward.So June 2018 or something like that,I start, I start streamingand I start streaming some Fortnite.End up getting affiliated,end up doing the whole extra life thing.I end up really enjoying it.I'm like, \"This is a lot of fun.\"I'm playing Fortnite at that point. Okay?So mind you, I'm a Fortnite\nstreamer at that point,and I start really enjoying it.I keep doing it and then one day I decideI'm gonna do some programming.Because I really love Vim\nand I think I'm fast at Vim,and maybe people think\nprogramming is kinda cool.Because there was no\nreally programming sectionat that point.And I did it.I had like 30 people show\nup, which was just...And it felt like incredible\nnumbers at that point.So I was like, \"Oh my gosh,there's like 30 people\nwatching me program.\"And so it just kept on going\nand it kept on happeningand it just kept on growing.And I did it for year after year.I would do my job, I would come home,I'd eat dinner with the kiddos,I would read them Lord of the Ringsand the Hobbit during that time,I'd read to them for a half an\nhour, then I'd set that down.And then three nights\na week I would programuntil like 2:00 in the\nmorning or play video gamesuntil 2:00 in the morning streamingand building up this whole side thing.And I did this for a long, long time,and then eventually it just\nkept working out so welland I started making YouTube videos.And then that started getting better.And it was just a long, long\ngrind until April of last year.I went to the Streamer Awardsand I got to announce\nthe programming categoryand Pirate SoftwareOne.It was awesome. It was a great time.And during that time he\ngave me a challenge coinand just said, \"You just got to go for it.Just go full time.\"And so I just sat there and\nmy wife can attest to it.It was like an emotional turmoil thingand it just took a lot of,it was pretty awful because I didn't...Netflix is very safe option.It was both very fun. It was challenging.I liked a lot of the people worked withIt was overall a really great thing.I had a really great boss,\nreally appreciated him.I still have text him now and\nthen he's really great guy.So it's just like I'm\nleaving all these thingsfor something that's unsure.And the reality is that\nstreaming and all these things,you know, people love you one day,they could hate you the next day.There's all this stuff that goes intobeing on the public side.And I had Netflix as the backing,so it's like if public hated\nme the next day I'd be like,deuces, I'm out.I don't care.Now it's like, now I'm\ngonna do this as a job.And so there's a whole huge\nturmoil to this whole thingthat I kind of went through it.And eventually I just said,\nokay, I'm gonna make this.It resonated with mewhen I first made the\ndecision to join Netflix.I'm getting older.There's not a lot of chances\nto do something unusual.Those chances go down\nconstantly as you get older.This might be the last\ncrazy thing I get to do.Let's just try it.So in April I went full-timeand I guess I haven't looked back.I'm only not even a year into\ndoing this as a full-time gig.And it's just been a lot of fun.And the biggest thing is just\nbeing able to really exploreand do these things on streamwhere people really enjoy\nwatching and engaging.It's been a great, hard, fun,amazing, difficult experience.- It's a really inspiring leap.It's a really hard one\nto take for many reasons,like you outlined, but\nalso the loneliness of it,I think it's a pretty lonely pursuit.- It is. Yeah.- Just you and the camera and the audienceand the ups and downs of that.And there's not really a team.- I do have one lucky thing\nI'd say that, my editor, Flip,shout out Flip.- Flip, shout out.\n- He said it wouldmean the world to him if\nI said, \"Shout out, Flip.\"- I love you, Flip.- I love you, Flip.\n- We all love you.- Oh, man.He had, as he would say, he\nhad nothing going for him.He had a really hard growing up.A lot of rough life decisions\nhave gone into his lifeand he's crawling back out of it.And he just said, \"Hey, I'll\nedit full-time for you.\"So I just said, \"All right, like 50/50,whatever I make on YouTube, you get.We're gonna do this together.\"And we did that for years,\nmaking $0 a month pretty much.And so it's just like that\nwas an incredible jumpand now we get to work together.So I do get that one team aspectthat I think is really nice.But it's not like it was at Netflixwhere I could hear about\nstuff people are building,I don't have a team, I don't\nhave product or cycles,I don't have a manager that\nI have to try to make happy.It's just like...It is very lonely.And I don't think a lot of people realizehow lonely it actually can be.- Yeah, so combine that loneliness with,in my case, I don't know\nhow many people attack you.- I have a shockingly low\namount of attack rate,I feel like.- Yeah, people generally...I mean it's sometimes fun sort of teasing,that kind of thing, but\nit's mostly just really...You give so much love to the worldand inspire so many people,even when you're making\nfun of stuff, yeah.But with me taking the loneliness of itcombined with just really\nintense attacks, it's tough.It can be rough. Psychologically,\nreally a tough journey.You miss working with a team,just from even a software\nengineering side,where you can share\ncode or talk over code?- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- Or the collaborative aspect of it?- Yeah, multiple things there.One, hey, we love you Lex,so don't let the things get you down.- Thank you. Thank you.I love you too.- Thank you. Hey, little\nbonding moment here going on.But one thing I really miss-- Not in a sexual way, just to be clear.- The tension is a little tense here.- I'm getting uncomfortable.Yeah. Anyway, team.- It's just the one thing\nI really miss is just,even when I hated how people did it,just seeing how other\npeople solved things,it's really amazing just\nthe raw creative powerso many people have, and\njust being like, oh, wow,I would've never done it this way.Crazy, right? Wow, this is awesome.And then you kind of\ninternally process thisand you're like, oh, I\nnow have a new little toolin my tool belt.Because at some point it's\nreally hard to find a mentorwhen you're first, youngand you're just starting out programming.I mean, anyone with a\ncouple years of experiencewill be not just a little\nbit better than you,but infinitely better than you.It feels like crazy how\nmuch better people are.And so you have to get mentors\nand you learn from people.And then as you get better,that amount of availability\ngets really small.And so it's something\nthat I really do miss iskind of that forced hard\nproblem solving together.- I think there's also a\nskill to mining the wisdomfrom other people.I generally try to approach\neven junior people, young folks.It's just mentally, at least\nfor me, it works as a hackto assume they're the\nsmartest person in the world,way smarter than me.And so I take every single word they sayas potential wisdom,and that helps me sort of mine\nfor potential wisdom there.Because it's so easy once\nyou get older to judge,to be like, yeah, okay, okay.I've been through that. I\nremember feeling like that.I remember thinking that.\nThat's incorrect, whatever.But just kind of assume that I don't knowwhat the fuck I'm doing, and\nthe other person is this sage.And in that kind of interaction,I think you could actually learn a lot.And my favorite interactions\nis when we both think that way.So from there, I think that's a catalystfor a great, great\ncollaboration and interaction.- It just also makes\neverything much nicer.It really stinks to work with someonethat's combative and negative.I don't mind combativenessif it's like I'm trying to figure outwhat's best to do right\nnow, versus combativenessjust because you're a negative personand things have to be\nthis one particular way,because if they're not\nthis one particular way,it's the end of the world.And that's actually really\nhard for me to work with.- What's the origin story\nof ThePrimeagen name?- The origin story of\nThePrimeagen name was,are you familiar with a\nvideo game called Turok?Nintendo 64.- Yeah\n- So Turok had Turok Iand then Turok II.Turok II was a brutally hard game.This is back when first-person shooters,they would only give you a\ncertain amount of health,and you had to go discover\nhealth and get that health.And you had to beat the whole gamewithout effectively dying.That's an old, that's like\nthe first version right there.That's like Turok I and Turok II.- Turok is a renowned first-person\nshooter video game seriesfeaturing dinosaurs,\naction, and sci-fi elements.The franchise has evolved significantlysince its inception in 1997.- There you go.So in 1998, there, you\ncan see it right there.- Turok II, Seed of Evil followed in 1998featuring larger levels,\nmore challenging puzzles,and deadlier enemies.- The notable difficulty,it was very, very, very difficult.So I spent, when I got it,\nit came in a black cartridge,not like your standard gray Nintendo 64,the black cartridge.Badass game.And I got it and I put it in and I played,and I played every day for 10 hours a day,for a month straight.And I beat it.And it was such an\nincredible, great experience.And the last leader of Turok\nII is called the Primeagen.And so when I was a kid,\nwhen you're in fifth grade,that's super cool,\nnamed after the bad guy.And so for a long time\non any internet thing,like Graal Online that\nI mentioned earlier,the name was ThePrimeagen.It was great.And then I became an adult\neventually, and it's just like,okay, I'm an adult. My name's\nMichael Paulson underscore.And that's what I was on the internetfor a long time was that.And I remember it was like 2017,2018, somewhere in there.I remember just how bad the\ntech world had kind of become.It was just like this\nsuper pretentious place,tons of dick measuring,just everything that just was the worst.Ken Wheeler got canceled\nover playing the Circle game.It was just like,it is so hard to describe to\npeople that weren't there,but it was just the worst place to be.Tech was extremely unfun.It was extremely awful.Everything was just so, it wasn't academicbecause it was research.It was like we're building\nthe most sophisticated things,and this is for the smart peopleand everyone else is the dumb people.Don't worry. We'll design for you, dummy.We'll show you how to make\nthe perfect architecture.And I remember changing my Twitter handlebecause I got so upsetand just went back to my video game name.I was like, I want things to be fun.I want this to stop.And so when I started streaming tech,my goal became to destroy\nwhatever that tech mentality was,because it includes nobody.Everyone thinks that\nthey're the smart peopleand they design for the dummies.And it's just like, no, I\nwant tech to be this placewhere people feel like they\ncan be creative, and excited,and actually build something.And if you're new, it's okay to be dumband ask dumb questions.Learn from your dumbness.No one's expecting you to be\nsmart. Pick whatever you want.Actually do something and have funand build your crazy ideas.Oh, you're going to reinvent\nthe wheel, reinvent the wheel,understand what you're\ndoing, learn it really good,and interact and stuff.And it was just so different\nthan what was out there.And the name...Arnold Schwarzenegger talks\nabout this thing where,when he first started acting,his name was the thing that people hated.As he once said, you have a strange voice,you have a strange body, and your name,your name's unpronounceable.No one's going to Schneitzinfinitzel,no one's going to remember that.- Yeah.\n- And he said,but now the name is the strong part.And for me, I've always felt akin to that,though my name's not nearly as cool,nor am I as popular as Arnold,nor am I as tough or\ngood-looking or successful.But nonetheless, it's just the namerepresented this counterculture\nmovement within myself,in which I just hated what was thereand I wanted to defeat it.And so this has been the thing.And now people remember me so wellbecause of how weird my name is.And so it's just like for whatever reason,it became its own thing.And so that's the...Now I would never change it,and back then I would never change itbecause it was my rage\nagainst the machine moment,if you will.- Yeah, I love that as a symbol of rageagainst the machine\nand the rage being fun.- Yeah.I just want people to be\ncreative and have fun again.It's okay.- What about the mustache?\nIt's an epic mustache.It's an epic stash. It\nhas a life of its own.Is there an origin storyor did you guys discover\neach other at some point?Or did it emerge from the darknessof the struggle that is your life,or where does it come from?- Well, the original mustache isthat it was no-shave Novemberback before it became Movember.It was no-shave November back in the day.And after no-shave November,\nyou had all this hair.And so what's the natural\nthing you got to do?You got to sport a\nmustache for a day. Right?So whenever I'd forget to\nnot shave for a long time,and then I'd let it start\ngrowing out really big,I just go, oh, this is kind of funny.I'll have a mustache.So one day when I was streaming,it's just one of those\ntimes I just didn't shave,and then I started just letting it go,and then I got kind of a beard,and then I just had a mustache.When I did it, people were just like,yeah, it's mustache time. And\nI was just like, heck yeah,it feels like a lifestyle decision.This is the fun times.And so all of a sudden\nit was just excitingto have a mustache.And I shaved it off and\nI was like, oh, okay.But then part of me is like\nthere's this weird energythat comes from just having a mustache.So I was like, I'm going back.Told my wife, forgive her.She was very not as\nthrilled about my decisionsto have a mustache long-term,but I just decided to have it backand it was the right thing.It's always been the energy\nthat I had was the mustache.It was always been there.It just never was visible\nuntil later on it feels like.- Yeah, we're chatting offlinehow one of the components\nof a successful relationshipis sacrifice and your wife was\nwilling to take the sacrificeof allowing you to have a mustache.- I clearly was not willing to\nsacrifice not having one. So.- You do this incredible thingwhere you tried a bunch of\ndifferent programming languageswhen you stream.You have like...You go all out on certain\nprogramming languageslike Rust and then go and\nthen try to pick a new one,but also are experimenting constantly.So maybe one question I\ncould ask is about learning.What's your approach to learning\na new programming language,and maybe what's your adviceon learning a new programming languagewhen you begin that journey?- So I've kind of done a\nbunch of different waysto go through this learning process,and I've tried a lot of different ones.Something that is obviously successfulis just start building something.Just put your hands on the keyboard,especially if you already\nknow how to program.You're like, okay, I'm now using Zig.How do I do a main function\nso I can just run the program?Okay, now I know how to build.Okay, how do I do an if\nstatement? What does it look like?Okay, how do I declare my own functions?How do I do modules, right?You just kind of Google your\nway through it, if you will,to get to the end product\nand build something.It's a great way to do thingsbecause I find that repetition,rote learning is obviously\nthe best way to do this.You have to kind of go over it a bunchand you can definitely get outand build a lot of stuff with that.I like that initial kind\nof get used to things.But on top of it, I find\nthat, by doing that,you also fall into traps.You kind of Google and\nyou try to solve a problemin the language based on all\nof your previous experience.And so you don't have what\nmakes that language special.You have what all the other\nlanguages make special.And so you end up kind ofnot really being able to\nuse it very effectively,but you can certainly kind of learn itand get kind of good at it.And so the second approach\nI've been doing lately,and this has been inspired\nby the creator of Ghosty,Mitchell Hashimoto, is to just startby reading the language\nreference, the whole thing.And so lately I've been\njust kind of going throughand just reading the entire\nmanual for these languages.Like Zig, I'm almost done with that one.It's like 8 to 10 hours of\njust sitting down reading,and I'll whip out my\ncomputer and kind of practicea couple of the things\nfrom the actual docs,and that way I can learn all the things.So then when I start building\nagain, I'll remember,okay, I know there's a thing over here,let me go reread about itbecause now I have it\nindexed in my brain somewherethat will remember.And so I don't think there's\na right or wrong way.I mean at the end of the\nday, the right way is alwaysthat you have to build\nsomething eventually.You cannot just read about it.You have to put your\nhands on the keyboard,you have to build something out.And then once you do that,\nthat's where you really discoverwhat makes it painful\nor what makes it great.And if you don't have the breadthof what the language offers,you just may make it painful\nby simply being bad at it.- Where exactly are you reading this-- [ThePrimeagen] Language reference.- The language reference.- [ThePrimeagen] So it just goes throughevery feature top to bottom.\n- That's a lot. Yeah.- [ThePrimeagen] Every way it's described,all the different things.I think Zig's is, it's a decent size,but it's not just simply read the words.You want to internalize\neach concept as well.So it takes a long time.\nSo I'm a slow reader.- So you're building, in AI\nterms, like a background model.'Cause I don't think you\ncan just start buildingonce you're done reading\nbecause you probably forgothow to do a for loop.You kind of forget the specifics.You just are building\nup the design choices,the set of features available,what are the strengths and weaknesses,all that kind of stuff.And then you start building.\nThat's really interesting.Probably not the thing you would recommendto a junior developer,somebody who's just starting out at first.- If you don't know\nwhat an if statement is,that's not a good way to learn.To me, the best way to learn then isreally hands on the keyboardand building extremely simple things,and slowly growing in complexity.Because understanding\nwhat a class and methodsand instances versus the blueprint,which is the class versus functionsversus modules versus all that stuff.That just takes time to learn.And so that's a completely\ndifferent style of learning.- I wonder because for\nme, learning right now,AI is a huge help, but I already\nhave a lot of experience.I wonder, if you're starting from scratch,whether that's a good idea.But I still think it's\nprobably a really good idea,but basically generate some code using AIand figure out what it's doingby playing with different parts.Maybe can you comment on that aspect,like the use of AI as part\nof the learning process?- This is where I have both\nthe hopeful and the doomer takeat the exact same time.\n- Yeah.- And it's the same thing\nwith Google or Stack Overflow,it's all the same kind of take,which is it's just making\nthings more democratizedin some sense.I get to ask questionsin probably the most personal possible waywith my own voice, in my own words,and it's able to produce out answersand hopefully help guide me.Now, regardless of just say the errorsand the incorrectness of\nit, ultimately just using itas a learning tool and\nbeing able to just formulateand read answers in your own voice,I think is super powerful.And I think it's super amazing.But the part that I think\nis gonna be really difficultis that we don't valueremembering things anymore as a society.Since the internet came about,\nI can just look that up.I can just look that up.You don't need to memorize\nyour times tables. Right?You can just use a calculator.\nYou can just do all that.I remember I just was\nsitting on the airplaneand I watched someone do the\nworld's most simple additionand subtraction like 10\ntimes on their phone.And why are you not just...You should already know,you should be able to do these things.And I realized that we kind\nof offload our brains, right?Oh, I don't need to know these thingsbecause I can look them up.And that's not a bad answer in some sense.I can understand that.I don't need them to\nremember every last thing,but then it also makes me realizethat you kind of develop\nthis learned helplessness,that a new error comes up.I'll just ask the AI.AI says, oh, okay, I got to\nfix this line. I fix the line.You didn't actually learn anything.You kind of just used it as a quick meansto get something out and move on.And so you sacrifice knowledge for speed,which is a great thing in some...We have to make those trade-offsall the time in engineering.Sometimes you have to move fastat the sacrifice of knowledge,and I'm totally on board for that,but I worry that what we'll createis an entire generation\nof incompetent programmerswho can do some amount of things well,but anything that is unique, bespoke,or requires some extra\nlike little elbow grease,might become very difficult.It might cause a whole chasmwhere juniors remain juniors forever.And I don't want to see that.\nI want to see people grow.I want to see people\nactually be able to take thisas a craftsmanship thing.And so that's both my hope and my worryis that AI think can do both really.If you could ask whatever\nquestion you wantand you don't have to rely on, say, a bookto give you that exact answer.And if the book just said it wrongand you can't understand\nit, it's just like,sorry, you don't get\nto learn what this is.Like recursion for me, I\nspent way too much timeuntil someone gave me the right problemto understand recursion.You could imagine AI could\nhave solved that for meway faster because it could\nhave gave me the right problemand walked me through much better.But what happened if I just\nalways have recursion solvedby them and not actually learn it myself?- So if I ask AI to generate\ncode to do a certain thing,actually a large percentage of time,most of what AI generates is\ngoing to be correct for me,but some percent of time\nit's not, fundamentally not.And for me to recognize the\ndifference between those two,I think it takes a lot of experience.I think to learn that skill of knowing,no, no, no, a different\nnew out of the box solutionis needed here than the\none you're providing.You're missing the point.That's a skill, and how do you learn that?You learn that by building from scratch.So both are probably really necessary.But I think as a first step\nof learning how to program,it's pretty nice to generate a function,to generate for loops and\nall that kind of stuff,and then just fuck with the\ndifferent lines and modify themto try to adjust the\nbehavior of the program,and from the way the behavior\nof the program adjustsor bugs are created, you\nlearn about the syntaxof the language, the\nbehavior of the language,all that kind of stuff.So I think it's a super\npowerful way to learn.But yeah, you need to\nalso write from scratch.- At some point you have to\ntake off the training wheels,because I think what\nyou're really spottingis the difference between\nreading and writing code.I can read a lot of languages very well.I can see what's happening.I can understand it,but I would not be very\ngood at writing it.I can understand a lot of things about C++and I can read it, but I'm just not thatbecause I just don't, I\nhaven't done it in so long.I can't remember where all\nthe semicolons, and colonsand you do public and private,and how should you do naming conventions?All those things kind of add all together,and then you're just like, oh,\nI'm really bad at writing it,though I can read it.And so there's a skill gap chasmthat exists between those two.- All right. Well, let me talk\nabout the various languages.The cheesy, ridiculous questionof what's the best programming language?Let's say, what's the\nbest programming languagethat everybody should learn?Maybe let's go with the top five.I'm gonna pull up the Stack\nOverflow developer survey,because I think we have....- Yeah, those are...\n- You don't like them?- You gotta remember, because\nI mean, you're a data guy.You know about biases and data.What does Stack Overflow\nnaturally bias towards?- Well, they have the different slicesof professional developers,\njunior developers,they have different slices.Okay, what is the bias?- I hear you, but who fills\nout a Stack Overflow survey?Someone who participates\non Stack Overflow.Who's participating on Stack Overflow?Largely very, very new people,and that one guy that\nloves answering questions.And so I'm not sure if Stack Overflowis a great place to get data.It could be a very biased set of data.- Is it really only new people?- I mean that's who's\nusing Stack Overflow.- All right. Most popular technologies.On this...- JavaScript, HTML, Python, SQL.- SQL is the more general kind of...I'm sure they're not doing the individualsort of flavors of SQL.By the way, pronounce SQL versus SQL?- It's SQL.- SQL? You SQL?- SQL, I think is the correct way.- SQL.- I did SQL because I\ndidn't know the audience.I don't know if they can handle the truth,which is its SQL- The squeal of joy, squeal...- SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL.- By the way, I had a lot of joyfrom earlier saying\npig-fucker, for some reason.- It's such a dig...I mean, can you believe\n- I had so fun to say-- that was a real conversation that I had?- Yeah, that was.TypeScript, BAS,Java, C Sharp, C++, C-PHP.- It largely kind of aligns\nwith the world you'd expect,but Assembly, why is Assembly\nmore popular than Ruby?Who's writing just Assembly by...No one writes Assembly by handother than maybe that one\nguy that's developing TLS 1.3and hand rolling a cryptography algorithmto be the fastest possible algorithm.- Yeah. Assembly is a weird one.Maybe people write it maybe in school,but even in school nowfor a operating systems\ncourse or something like that,or system engineering.I don't know if they\nwrite Assembly anymore.I don't think so anyway.- And Swift and Ruby being\nless popular than Assemblyseems ridiculous.But nonetheless, okay, so\nyou get my ideas behind that,but as far as top five languages go,that's probably too broadbecause you could just name so many.I think you should\nprobably archetype it bywhat do you want to do?So if you want to get\ninto game development,perhaps C Sharp, C++\ncould be good choices.Or JavaScript and doing Canvas games,I could see that also working.But you're limited by\ndoing JavaScript obviously,because you can't do as muchbecause the language is just\nnot fast enough to do as much.So it's like a good thing to remember.If you're gonna be doing backend stuff,if you want a job, if\nyou're looking for a job,maybe C Sharp slash Java, or JavaScript,or Go would be great choices.If you're looking to do embedded,you probably want to do C, C++,like that would probably be a good choice.And so you kinda have to...I think you have to first determinewhat do you really want to get out.- If you're just curious\nabout programming,which I talked to a lot of people who are,yeah, you can consider jobs,but basically their question is,okay, what's the first\nlanguage I should learn,and maybe what are the several\nlanguages I should explore?- Can I say somethingthat's gonna make a lot of people angry?- Yeah, sure.- I think the first\nlanguage people should learnif they have no idea about\nanything is JavaScript.- Yeah. Why would that make people angry?- Oh, because people just, first off,I'm not supposed to say\nanything nice about JavaScript.- Yeah, usually that's the meme,that you hate JavaScript, right?- Yeah. No, JavaScript's\na beautiful language.And it has a lot of things\nthat are very great for it,and one of them is that\nyou can express anythingwith very little effort.And so someone that's new,\nI think it's really greatto be able to draw a box and move a box.That's great. You get to see it visually.I think that's one thing\nthat's really greatabout JavaScript is that you can do that.Then you can go, okay, I want\nto learn about the backend.I want to make a request now.You can write a quick backend in it.Now you're starting to get familiarwith programming a little bit.I can save this to a database.I can bring it down.I can put it on a screen and\nI can animate it all around,and I can even put it on a\ncanvas and render it in 2D or 3D.So it's like there's so much\nvariety of what you can dowith JavaScript.It's a great way to get\nintroduced into programming.But then at some point you have to go,okay, I now need to learn\nmore about this whole thing.- I mean, yeah, just like\nyou said, you can make games,you can do front end,\nbackend for web development.- You can even do embedded.They actually have...Like there's Wes Bos is\nbuilding his Roomba or somethingand programming it with\nJavaScript and React,which is just the world's worst languageto choose for embed,\nbut you can still do it.- Also, we mentioned sort\nof in terms of applications,anything that relates to\ndata or machine learning,Python is the sort of the leader there,so that's a great one.- It seems like Python, CUDA stuff and C++would be a dynamite in that,because a lot of these\nPython libraries are assumedyou're just smuggling in C++\nunderneath the hood or C.- Okay, so JavaScript. I'll say Python.- Python's a great one too.\nYou can get quite far with it,but you can't write the front end.What happened if you love the front end?What happened if you really\njust want to design thingsand you just didn't know that?- Well, it's okay. So\nfor that, JavaScript.- But Python's a good choicebecause you can't do the ML stuffin JavaScript nearly as easy.- Do we count HTML and CSS\nas programming languages?- I think there's some\ntechnical definition that it is.If you use this certain\namalgamation of CSS plus HTML,it actually has, it can be\na Turing complete language.But I mean for practical purposes, no.HTML is not a language.For me, yes, the Turing\ntest is a good one,but for those that are just\nnot wanting to be as academic,if I can't write a function\nand an if statement,I don't feel like that's...If I can't loop, if, and function,I don't feel like that's a good,that's a programming language.- Although modern HTML\nhas a lot of features.- It's crazy how much it has,but it's more of a specification\nthan anything else.I specify it to be a pop-up.I specify it to have this\nkind of accessibility,this kind of look.Under these conditions look like this,transform like this, move down here.- I don't know.I kind of like these popular\nprogramming languagesin this list.I like JavaScript.- You like Bash?- Oh, yeah. I like Bash a lot. Yeah. Why?- Okay, Bash is kind of one\nof those ones where it's like,do you really like it?I like it up until I need an array.- Oh, as a programming language, just no,but I like the command line.- Okay.- Do you like Bash? No, nobody likes Bash.(Lex and ThePrimeagen laugh)Do you mean-- Someone is so offended right now.- It means do you use it a lot? Yes.I mean, it's good to learn, right?It is good to-\n- It is.- Be comfortable in the command linebecause it's a bit of a superpower.It's like, I think I\nfollow on Twitter, FFmpeg.- Great account.(Lex chuckles)- There's certain Twitter\naccounts that are just legit.And I think FFmpeg,they have all these sort of parametersthat you can add on the command line,that it's like one of\nthose cryptic languagesthat only very few wizards understand.But once you begin to slowly understand,and I'm only at the very\nsort of beginning stageof that journey to mastery,the powers you gain at every step,it grows exponentially, it feels like.I mean, FFmpeg is just this incredible,what would you call a library system?There's just the people behind themmust be just brilliant mastermindsbecause they have to work\nwith all these codecs,with all these containers,with all the mysteries of\nthe media codec universethey're masters of.And they understand compression,which is another super fascinating\ntechnical set of problemsthat, I don't know, just\nFFmpeg just fills me with joythat it exists.But you need kind of Bash type comfort,command line comfort, to work with itto really unlock its power, yeah.- I think FFmpeg is probablyone of the most consequential\nlibraries of our day,and the Twitter account is so unhinged.It is the most amazing thing to seebecause I think FFmpeg does\nnot get the love it deserves.Every single application, OBS,probably FFmpeg underneath the hood.Everything, FFmpeg underneath the hood,and yet they do not get\nthe love they deserve.I just love it. I just\nthink they're the best.- Yeah, I would say JavaScript, HTML, CSS,Python, SQL, I mean that is SQL,SQL is a programming language.It's an incredibly sophisticated\nprogramming language. Yeah?- SQL is interesting.I believe you can classify\nit as a programming language.It does have, if.You have case statementsand it's pretty crazy\nwhat you can do with it.- You could do functions,\nyou can do all that stuff.You shouldn't.\n- Yeah, for stored procedures,that's how you make your life hell.I will say that all the\ntop languages right there,none of them are strict\nstatic typed languages.And so even TypeScript,\nI don't like this any.And so for people that are learning,doing something that's much\nmore strict would be great.Something like Go, Rust,I mean even C Sharp, C++.Anything that kind of changes\nyour perspective of typesI think is really helpful\nto kind of go through.They're not getting nearly as much loveon this most popular language list,but I think they're very fantastic.- All right, well, if I\nput a gun to your head,top five languages, let's list them out.There's a bright-eyed\n20-year-old asking you,what are the top languages,\nfive languages to learn?- If I were to pick five languagesthat I think people\nshould learn, or at least,let's restate it this way,I'm gonna say a couple languagesand you should at least\nexplore some of them.I think you should\nexplore a loosey language,so Python slash JavaScript,where there is truly only one\ntype, which is a boxed value,which is a multivariate, different typesunderneath the hood.- What did you call it? A loosey language?- A loosey-goosey language.It's a dynamic language,and so I think it's really good\nto explore one of those too.So I'd put Python or\nJavaScript right there.Even Lua, throw Lua in the bunch.I think you should\nexplore a strict language,so I'd do something like Rust, Go.I think those are both\nreally, really great.- C++?- You can do C++.You can do some type erasure in C++.You can do it with Go as\nwell, but for the most partit's a great language to do that in.It can get a little wild.\nNew C++ seems great.Everyone keeps telling\nme new C++ is great.It has every feature you've ever wantedand all the features you don't want.- Yeah, exactly.I mean there's smart pointers,\nthere's dumb pointers,there's all kinds of pointers.There's no memory leaks.\nThat's not an issue.- Foot guns, face guns, soft beds.There's everything in there.- Unless you like memory leaks,it has that too if you want\nthat kind of thing. It's great.- Okay. How about this one?Languages that I actually\nwant to really learn,that at least sit in my curiosity bank.There's three languages,which is going to be Swift, Elixir, OCaml,and then I'm going to throw Odin in there,just because Ginger Bill is great.But Elixir and OCaml,I don't have a strong functional languageunderneath my belt.That's something that\nI just genuinely lack.- Yeah, I've heard incredible\nthings about Elixir,about Odin, about OCaml.Obviously, I'm a person, as\nyou know, who loves Lisp.- [ThePrimeagen] I have never done Lisp.Lisp could be in that\ncategory too, just, or ClosureI think at this point is what\neveryone tells you to use.- So in the case of Lisp,I don't want to speak\nnegatively about Lisp,but it's important about modern community,what the community looks like.It seems like there's\nan excited, maybe small,but an excited community\naround Elixir, Odin, and OCaml,so that helps.Because then you can post shit\non Twitter that you're like,I accomplished this.People get excited and it's\nnice. It's a good feeling.- You can post something on Twitterand you'll get a thousand likesif you do something cool on Elixir,which is that's a pretty\nbig amount of peopleto like a post for such a niche topic.Programming's already\na pretty small topic.Then you get into functional program.That's a small topic in a small topic.- Yeah. I don't get that much.If I post something about Emacs,I'll get crickets if I\npost something about...If I proudly use Neovim,there'd be a lot of people like, good job.- Because it is the best editor.- Yeah, maybe it's just hype.- Come back to the Civil War, Lex.- Yeah, sometimes you have to sacrificeand go from the superior\neditor that is Emacsand choose Neovim just to be popular.You sacrifice integrity and valuesand quality for just popularity.It's a choice you made.\n- Absolutely.I love how you put it.- Okay. Anyway, what\nwere we talking about?I like how you're doing this\nin bunches. That's great.- Right now, my kind of side honeysthat I'm exploring-\n- Side honey?- Yeah, side honeys.\nThey're not my mainstay.Right now Go's kind of my favorite oneto build a web app in.If I'm gonna build some sort of backendwith a lot of complicated\nlogic, Go's just so convenient.But I get really\nfrustrated with its abilityto express everything that I need.If you have a list, a heterogeneous list,a list that contains two types,Go's just really not that fun to use.And I could see, so the ones\nI'm exploring is Jai or J,or the language as Jonathan\nBlow says, and Zig.And both of them have\na lot of power to them.They're both very interesting.They definitely have foot guns in them.They're definitely more, they\ndon't take it easy on you.Zig seems like it's a\nreally amazing language,and so does Jai.They're both very cool.- Yeah. Actually, I saw Dave\nPlummer's testing of closeto 100 languages for speed,\nand Zig came out on top.- Yeah. That was a mistake.I mean, when I say mistake,\nnothing against Dave Plummer.He's an extremely talented engineer.It's just that Zig, C, C++,all those languages\nthat were being tested,they're all LLVM backends, right?That's the one that\nactually turns the thinginto the executable part.And if there's a variation in speed,it just means in one language\nyou didn't quite expresswhat you are supposed to correctly.There's the language ball testthat's been bouncing around on Twitter.Zig was like sixth or seventh belowI forget what language it is.I played around with the example,added the word \"no alias\" to the argument,which means that the piece of memorythat's coming into this function,there's no global pointers,\nthere's nothing to it,and so the compiler can makethese really cool optimizations.And I made it faster than the C version.So it just means that it's\njust not correctly specifiedis all that means.- Yeah, but it's still exciting.To me, the competition between Zig, Rust,and C++ is really interesting.Part of it's for speed.Part of it's how easy it is\nto write performant code.- I'll say something that's...The reason why I think\nZig is so interestingcomparatively to say C or Rust.C is the ultimate language.It can do anything, you\nhave pre-process or macros.You can do quite a bit with it,but it's also really difficult.And it's also really simple\nand you can learn it.So it's kind of its own unique beast.And when you get really good\nat C, C is a magical languageand people are really great at itand people speak very highly of it.Rust is like this ultra safe language.What you can do in C, you just\ncan't even express in Rust.Rust is gonna be the safe\nman that holds you at night,keeping you warm, right?It's gonna be just the greatest.But somewhere in the middle\nlies Zig. Zig has optionals.If you're not familiar with optionals,that just simply means there's\na value here or there's not,but you first have to check\nthat before you can use it.So it prevents that whole null pointerdereferencing segfault problem.And that's not available\nin C, just by default,you have to kind of build that thing in.It is the only option in Rust,but Zig says, \"Hey, if you have a pointer,you can't express it as nullunless if you market that it can be null.\"There's ways around it,\nthere's other types of pointersand stuff like that that can do that.But for the most part,Zig will give you safety\nfor the most part.So it's like a little bit\nof safety, but more like C.So it kind of gives you\neverything you want in that regionwhere you can express\nsafe code and unsafe code.It's very easy to write. It's very pretty.Or at least the idea\nbehind it is very pretty.The language itself is bland, but.- Wow, there's beauty in everything-- Yeah.\n- Prime.You've programmed in Rust a lot.What do you love about Rust?What are the strengths?\nWhat are the weaknesses?Maybe you can speak\nabout memory managementthat you already mentioned,the challenge of memory managementthat several of these languages address,but yeah, what do you love about Rust?- What I love about Rust,I love the ability to free the memorythat you're using is\ndirectly tied to the stack.So whenever you create something,\nthere's a stack variableor there's some amount of stack memory,whether it's a pointer off to the heap,a pointer and a length.So some amount of memory on the stackand then some memory on the heapbecause a string is not all on the stack,it's some on the heap, some on the stack.And when that stack\nvariable goes out of scopeand gets cleaned up, it also\ncleans up what's on the heap.So it kind of simplifies\nthis whole idea of,whoops, I forgot to free my memory.It just does it for you.- So it's not a garbage collector,which will do it sometime later.It's not like C where you\nhave to call it yourself,it's somewhere in between.Now, there's a lot of\nstrategies people use,arenas and all that that\nmake that C part much easier.I'm just not even mentioning it,but it just makes it a lot easier.But Rust does that really beautifullyand it's just like a\nreally cool idea about itand I really like that.And the second thing that\nI think Rust does really,is such a good thing is\nthat mutability of somethingis you have to specify it.So you don't just create a\nvariable and then mutate it.You have to say this\nis not only a variable,it's a mutable variable.And I think that just\nmakes code really readableand really understandable.Because anything that does not havethe word mute next to it,you know for a fact it cannot change.There's some rules around that,but you get the general idea.- Unlike most programming languages,you have to explicitly statethat this is going to be changed.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- Yeah. That's really interesting.I mean it's safe, it's trying to be,and the safety might\nbe, create limitations.Let us consult the AI overlords.Rust is a blazing fast\nmemory efficient systemsprogramming language that\nemphasizes performance,type safety and concurrency.The language enforces memory safetywithout using a garbage\ncollector, as you said,instead utilizing the unique,\nquote, \"borrow checker\"that tracks object\nlifetimes at compile time.This prevents common programming\nerrors like null pointor dereferencing and memory\nleaks and so on, yeah.So you've also spoken\nabout metaprogramming.Which of these languages do you likefor the metaprogramming?I love metaprogramming in\nC++, but it's a giant mess.At least when I program\nC++ 17 standard, I believe,it's just a mess,\nespecially a mess to debug.- Yeah, I would consider myselfkind of a metaprogramming newbie.I have only solved some\namount of problems with it.That's kind of like what this year is for,is for me to really, I want to seewhere the ends can go in that.So I don't have a strong\nopinion on this one.Zig, one thing I really like about Zigis that the metaprogramming\nis also the language itself.So you don't have to,\nthere's not an alternative.So with Rust there's an alternative.When you create a macro, you\nhave to do the macro syntax.With Zig, it's just, it is the thing,you just program it and\nyou add the word comp timeif you want it to be a compile time only.So you can create the\nlist of prime numbersat compile time in Zig,which is kind of an\ninteresting, unique thing.So you have code that\nexecutes at compile timeand then you can take advantageof the result of it at runtime.So neat, right?That's how I'd look at it.But again, I haven't used it to the pointwhere I feel like I can super\nauthoritatively talk about it.- You have been undecided,what language are you going for this year?- I'm gonna keep Go as my mainstay,my two side honeys, Jai and Zig.I'm going to explore and try\nto build out a service in themthat can do a bunch of\ntalking to, say, ChatGPTand ElevenLabs and send\nstuff down to clientand work with web sockets.And I want to make sure\nthat, I just want to seehow do they perform in this realm.And I may be using the\nlanguage incorrectly,like Jai, it's not really been\ndesigned for the web world.I just got done writing the\nability to read Twitch Chatand it required me to do Berkeley sockets.So if you're unfamiliar\nwith Berkeley sockets,it's like the old way of doing\nit, it's how you do it in C.So you have to kind of go\nthrough the whole nine yardsof creating your own connection.I had to create my own connection,I have to read from the socket,then I have to parse\nout all the IRC, right?You have to kind of build it from scratch.There's not like a new TCP\nconnection to this server.You have to be like,\n\"I'm creating a socket.\"You're gonna be of the IPv4 familyand TCP and you're gonna do, you know,I'm gonna now have to take your addressand go look up your address\nwith DNS, get that address backand then connect to a TCP.So it's a lot more manual still.It's a lot more raw in\nthat area, but it's fun.- What are some epic projects\nyou've built on streamthat jump to memory?- My most favorite...Sorry for interrupting you.So I'm really jazzed right now.- Let's go.- Okay. So jazzed.- Jazz hands.- My most favorite project\nwas the one I did last year.Someone built a Doom ASCII port.So you could play Doom with ASCII.So that means you could\nplay it in your terminal.Very, very fun, very excite.So I made a Go program that\ncould spawn out the Doom ASCII,then I took that Doom ASCII\nand I sent it to the browserso that people could play\nDoom ASCII in the browser,but then I made it so that Twitch chatcould control that instance of Doom ASCIIby piping in Twitch chat,taking the average of the\nmovements over so much timeand replaying it as if\nit was a controller.And I had Twitch chat beat\nlevel one by spamming it.But the fun part wasI used a bunch of fun encoding techniques.I used quad trees to be\nable to take smaller amountsto use run length in coding.Tried to create my own\ncompression algorithmbecause if you're sending\nout a bunch of ASCII stuff,it's still pretty expensivebecause you have to represent\ncolor, color's not cheap.On top of it you have to\nrepresent what does it look like?What does the ASCII look like?Well, I realized there's all\nthese fun techniques you can dofor compression like the shape\nof the ASCII you send downin a lot of these engines are\nactually just proportionalto the lumosity of that pixel.So you'd use an eight to representor a pound sign to represent white,but black, you're gonna\nwant to do a periodor a comma or a bar, something smaller.So it's like I then developed all thesedifferent compression algorithms\nthat turn a bunch of data,which would take, I forget\nhow much it would take.It'd take gigabytes upon gigabytesto be able to send out\nto thousands of peopleto all see the same\nimage at the same time,to all be able to interact\nwith Doom at the same time.I turned it from gigabytes into kilobytesby just trying to figure outhow to make it as small as\npossible and send it all out.It was super fun.\nAbsolutely had a great time.- So you're actually sending\nit to all the people in chat.So where's that pipeline,how chat is able to\ncontrol the Doom thing?- Twitch chat.Yeah, so they would\ngo, people would spam Wand if you said W, it would\nhold down W for 150 millisecondsif the majority of people\nduring that time period said W.- Nice. Okay.And how are they getting the inputof where you are on screen?- So originally I was gonna\nsend that through Twitch,but Twitch is like five seconds behind,so that's why I piped it out to a website- Ahhh.\n- so everybody could seefrom my computer to the websiteand typical lag was right\naround 70 milliseconds.So it's like they could\nmostly see what was happeningin that short period of time.It was pretty exciting.So we had 1,000 people,or I had somewhere between\n1,000 to 1,400 peoplesmashing Ws and pressing\nF to fire and turningand we killed some zombies.We blew up the barrel at\nthe very end of level oneto kill the Imp.- How are you getting the\nWs from the Twitch chat?Is there an API?- I was using IRC, so\njust a little TCP socketand then you just parse out IRC.- Okay. And there's very little lag there.Okay.- Yeah, I think it's a couple\nhundred milliseconds though.It's enough that it actually\nmade it a little bit difficultbecause people would often overturnand then go forward and miss the doorand then they had to go back and...- That's awesome.- It was awesome.So that was my favorite I\nthink project of all timejust because I never got\nto do a lot of encoding.Encoding's kind of like,\nwhat do you normally do?Okay, I need to send something down.I don't know, gzip it,\nserver will just do it.Server just does the right thing.I don't need to think about it.So instead it's like I think about it,I'm gonna send the right thing.- Yeah, you have to think\nabout the compression. Yeah.And there you go.That's some more love towards FFmpegbecause they have to\nthink about that a lot.- Ultimately inspired by\nFFmpeg and their awesomeness.- So can you speak to just\nthe chat community in general?A big part of what you doin terms of streaming is the humansthat are communicating with you live.Can you talk to the\ndifferent chat communities?First of all, which is\nthe best chat community,YouTube, Twitch, or X?- This is where I feel bad for YouTube,because I do think it's\ntechnically the worst,but it's not YouTube's fault.And let me kind of explain why.- And then I will\nexplain why you're wrong.But go ahead. YouTube is great.- I know you love YouTube\nbut let explain why,is that when you go on Twitch,\nyou go to anyone's channel,they have this cultural\nhuman centipede thingthat's happening where\nas the memes flow in,all of Twitch reacts and\nmorphs to all those memes.So every channel you go\nto has this same culture.There's a lot of similar\nemotes and everything,so it's very tight-knit.So when I stream, I get all the same jokesthat you would pretty much see if you saw,I don't know, Sodapoppin\nor some big streamer,Asmongold, whoever,\nPortahteh software streaming.All the same memes would all flowthrough the exact same kind of pipe.And so it's a very\nholistic kind of community.So every time you're making jokes,you're making jokes that are in the ether.Twitter kind of has that too.Tech Twitter kind of has a set of jokesand so you can kind of see it.The problem with Twitter chat isthat there's just nobody there right now.Typically just to put it into perspective,I have somewhere between,somewhere between like 1,500\nto 3,000 people on Twitch,somewhere between 800 to 2,000 on YouTube,and like 50 people on Twitter.So the difference is massive.But Twitter has that same\nthing that's developingwhere there's memes that are\nconstantly flowing through it.And so they're very highly connected.YouTube just doesn't seem to have that.They're just a bunch of people\nand people go to YouTubefor various reasons.I'm going to YouTube to learn.So they come in and they want to learn.So they're not on the meme train,they're not in this\ncultural zeitgeist train.They're just like, \"But why\nwould you use this if statementwhen a switch statement in\nthis one particular case?\"And you're just like, well, that's notwhat I'm trying to do here.- Yeah, you want to captain the meme trainor you want to ride on the meme train.- Yeah, or you just want to be ableto create a culture on your chatbecause your chat's\ngonna be some variationof that kind of zeitgeist\nthat's flowing through Twitch.And it kind of is very\ncontiguous between X and Twitch.It just feels really out\nof sync with YouTube.And then YouTube\nparticularly does a bad job.And some people would argue a\ngood job because you can swim.Swim being, you can actually changewhat timestamp you're at.So all of a sudden you'll be like,oh yeah, something about\ndriving to soccer in my minivan.And then 20 minutes later\nyou'll be talking about Zigand then someone's like,\"I personally use whatever\nto drive to soccer.\"And you're like, \"What\nare we talking about?\"So YouTube is a very\ndisjointed chat as wellbecause it depends on where\nthey're at within the video.Swim comes from Netflix,\nby the way, call it swim.- The term?- Yeah, people said swim.- Oh, so you're, okay.- Swimming through the...- Yeah. So you're not\njust making up the term.Thank you. Wow.- Yeah, but it's probably made upand probably only 10\npeople said it at Netflix,so no one's gonna know it\nand they're gonna be like,\"Yeah, right. That doesn't\nhappen on Netflix.\"- So going back to projects,what projects on stream or in general?- No, you need to answer why\nYouTube chat's the best chat.- Well, you kind of convinced me.Okay, why YouTube is the best chat.Well, I think I'm just a hater.That's basically what it boils down toand I'm just talking shit.\n- Love it.- And I'm probably just\nfrom the outside shooting inbecause Twitch is such\na fun culture of memes.And so it's just fun to\nshoot from the outsideto egg the house of Twitch.And then I just sit back on my lawn chairwith the small YouTube\ncommunity just talking shit.No, you're absolutely right.There's a real sense of\ncommunity that Twitch can form.But I just like the openness of YouTube.It's just better at opening to the world.It's more accessible,\nit's easier to share.It's just a more established\nplatform, that's all.- Fully on that team.- For the open world.I can send it to people\nthat don't usually watchvideo game streaming\nor that kind of stuff.- Yeah. If you send a\nTwitch link, they're like,\"I don't like video games.\"And you're like, \"Well\nactually it's not video games.\"That talk happens every\nsingle time you mention Twitchbecause Twitch does have a perspectiveabout it that YouTube does not.- I was just on Joe Rogan's\npodcast and I think it came up,he asked something like,\n\"Is Twitch still a thing?\"So that just gives you an example.And then Jamie said,\"Yeah, yeah, it's\ndefinitely still a thing.It's still growing and so on.\"And so yeah, there's just\na big slice of humansthat don't participate\nin the Twitch sphere.Yeah, I just like talking shit so yeah.- That's a beautiful answer.- But it's cool that you\nsort of make it accessibleon all these different platforms.And I have high hopes for X, but yeah,it's feature-wise still has\na lot of growing up to do.- And just why do people use X?You typically are going there\nfor a text-based interactionyou want to look through.So I also think they just\nhave a user expectation changethat needs to happen.And that just takes a while.That's gonna take a little\nbit before people get to it.I think their idea of audio\nfirst is a great first stepwhere people can listen to it\nand have the phone away maybe.There's a lot of changes\nthat have to happenbefore X can be successful in that.- I mean, X has this\nincredible comment sectionjust like Reddit, right?So it's like...- You said incredible. That's not Reddit.Comment section, correct.- Comment, yeah.Incredibly dynamic and\nvibrant even if it's...Yeah. What is the technological platform?How does the interface and the technologyshape the discourse?It's fascinatingbecause X has a different\nstyle than Reddit,different style than Facebook,different style than Instagram.It's interesting.And all those common sections\nare different technologically,like how the sorting is done,how easy it is to sort of\nbuild a community around it?Because YouTube is not really a community.Every single video on YouTube\nhas its own mini community.You're all talking on just that one video.But you can't jump across.- There's not like,\n\"Hey Bill, hey George.\"There's no crosstalk that\nhappens in multiple videos.- Yeah. But the community is awesome.I love community.I love the feeling of communityand I guess that's what\nTwitch really provides.- YouTube also does have it though.They have an aggregate community.There's a lot of fun comments\nand all that on the videosand a lot of thumbs up and\nthen you see the fun discoursethat happens and it's\nlike that's the community,it's just only a certain slice sees it.- I think that's even more so\non YouTube for live-streaming.All the same folks show\nup and they talk shit,they celebrate, the meme train arrives.- Yeah.- Okay. So now, what projects\nshape you as a programmer?Whether the ones you streamed or offline.- For me, I don't knowif there's a one project I can point to,but I can point to a specific\nspot where I think it happensand where I think you\ncan learn a lot from.Any small program you\nwrite will be somewherebetween 1,000 to 5,000 lines of codeI consider a pretty dang small project.You can correlate this to any featurewithin a larger system as well.A specific feature on a website\ncould be a thousand lines,a couple thousand lines.- There's a point in which\nall of your choices add up.And I typically find thatright around 5 to 10,000 lines of code.The choices you've made\neither weigh you downor kind of free you up.And so it's right in that,that I feel like I learned the most isbecause I love getting to\nthat point in a projector in some small part of the code basebecause at that point I get to test, A,how good were my initial\ngut decisions abouthow I designed the software,but B, now I need to\ngo back and think abouthow am I going to do testing across thisin a more effective way?How can I scale this out\nto 20,000 lines of code?How can I do all these thingswith what I've got or do I\nneed to kind of rethink it?And I find that that's reallywhere the best learning\nhappens is that everybodyhas probably a different\nnumber that exists,and as you go to each one of these numbersor how well or holistic you\nwant your project to be,I think that you'll come\nup with different numbers.And I think that number\nshould just get biggeras you get more experienced.Because there's projects that\nare a million lines of code,but they're most certainly\nnot holistic, right?Every part of the code base is some ageat some capsule of time with\nsome sort of programming style.Some is more functional,\nmore class-based, more,God help your soul if it's\npre-processor macros in C++.There's all these different\nkind of things you'll findthroughout time.And so that's why I try to\nthink about it as the featureor the thing you're working on.It's usually about 5,000 lines iswhere I find that things get kind of,did I make good or bad decisions?And that's where I do all\nmy learning is, right,on that phase. I'm trying\nto get it to the pointwhere I should be able\nto shoot from the hipand do 20,000 lines and\nnot be upset about it.- So first of all,just enjoying the thing\nyou create part, yeah.About there you can sit back and seeall the parts dancing together.For me, also debugging,you get to see the choices\nyou make materializeas like how easy it is to debug.I'm a big proponent,I think you've mentioned this in the past,I put asserts everywhere.- No. You are the reason why I do that.You were like the first one.Keep on going, sorry.- Really? Okay.So for me, one of the joys,whether it's try catch box,whether it's assert, whether\nit's with the testing,I get to see the payoffof all the minefield of assertsI've laid out before me in my kingdomby how quickly I can debug\na system as it grows larger.And I can first of all discover errorsbefore they become real bugsand also how quickly I\ncan solve those errors.And that brings me joy.For me, a lot of the joys of programmingis creating powerful systems\nthat don't break down,that work correctly,that work correctly in\nmajority of the cases.And there, sort of the\nstress testing the systemand getting all of the signalsfrom that system that\neverything is working correctlyis something that fills me with joyand makes sure that the\nsystem actually works.So yeah, that, I don't know if\nit's 5, 10,000 lines of code,if it's Java or C++ it's\nmillions lines of code.But yeah, in Python,yeah, I would say 10,000 lines of code.That's when you first\nget to see the magic.But anyway, you were saying?- Okay, so you and John Carmackhad a conversation about asserts.- Yes.- You talked about this idea\nof putting asserts everywherethat effectively crash the programwhen you have some state in your programthat should not be representedand you have made this choice actively.And so I've never done that before.And I know this is like an old techniqueand I obviously must be too youngor too dumb to know that\nthis was a thing people did.I grew up in Java and I\nthink that's probably whyI didn't run into this.So I saw that and I was like,I'm curious about how to use asserts more.And then I ran into a person named Joran.He's the CEO and creator of TigerBeetle.It's like the world's fastest,\ngreatest financial database.And it was spawned out of a companythat needed to do a bunch\nof financial transactions.And it's written in\nZig and what they do isthey do deterministic simulation testingand they just use NASA's kind of guaranteefor creating really great software.So don't use U size,specify your exact size of\nint you expect everywhere.All these kind of things\nthey do to be very specific.And one of them is that every functionshould contain two asserts.Whether it's positive spacelike these things should\nhappen or negative space,like this pointer should never be null.You're programming into things\nthat should never happen.Normally, you would\njust never specify that.You'd never think about that.So every single function\neverywhere has all these assertsand these asserts run both\nin production and in testing.They're always on.And then they take\ndeterministic simulation testingand run like 200 years\nof just random data,just complete slop\ngoing through the systemand seeing how far it goes.And when an assert happens,they're like, here's the\ninput that caused it,here's every last little\nbit that happened,and now you can identify\nwhere this went wrong.And it was so cool.So between you, John Carmack and Joran,that's where I got like,\nokay, I got to really...And NASA, I'll throw NASA a bone as well.NASA can join in on that one.I was like, okay, I want to\ntry this. And I did try it. Ibuilt this big reverse proxyfor me trying to do some\ngame development stuff.And I just went ham on the asserts.And then I built the whole\nsimulation testing thingthat could do everything\ndeterministically.So even the result of requestswould all come in specific orders.And I found a bunch of bugsthat I just would never have found.And then I did it for a game I was making.I found some bugs where\nmy cursor went off-screen,it would cause all\nthese different problemsbecause I just never tested them.And it's super funand it's like a really\ngreat way to program.- Yeah, I think it's a\nskillset you grow over time.It's not just that you have\nto specify the preconditions,everything that has to be true,it's also adding things that are like,you might not even think about.You have to sort of anticipate\nreally weird things.And if you add asserts,especially in complicated functionsor in complicated classes thatare able to catch really weird things,that's going to save you so many headachesand it's going to help you\nlearn about your own code.This is one of the things,I think it was Jonathan Blowthat either in conversation with youor was it in a presentation,he said that when he's\nstarting in a project,he usually doesn't know\nhow to implement it,how it's going to work.And I think he was sayingthat he wants a programming language.This might have been a\ncriticism of C++, I'm not sure,where he wants a programming languagethat makes it as painless\nas possible for himto not know what he's doing,\nhow he's going to implement it,and to quickly get to a place\nwhere he figures it out.I think there's a fundamental\npart of programming isbuilding stuff while not really knowingwhat the next thing you're doing is.You kind of have a loose\ndesign, maybe a strict design,but really you're solving\npuzzles that are not...It is a dark room in a fundamental sense.And there you have to anticipate\nthe kind of weirdnessesthat might emerge while not\nreally knowing everything.Just this full fog, fog of war.And there that's a real\nskill to anticipatethe kind of issues that might ariseand put a asserts on top of them.And it's also like spiritually, for me,been a really nice way\nof programming a buildingof living life as having\nvery strict assertsthat say, \"You're gonna fix\nthis problem if it ever arises.You can't just look the other way.\"This idea of treating warnings as errors.Make sure your code compiles\nwithout any warnings.That was a big leap for me.It's like, but there's so many of themand it's not really that important.It's like, no, no, no warnings.Make sure you treat every single problem,even fuzzy problems seriously,because that's actually\nlong-term is going to create codethat's much easier to work with,\nmuch more fun to work with,much more robust, resilient\nto all kinds of weirdnesses,all that kind of stuff.So it's a different way\nof approaching coding,probably more NASA-likeversus web programming style.But yeah, it has made\nprogramming for me personally,much more funbecause one of the most painful\nthings about programmingis creating when you get past\n10,000, 20,000 lines of codeand you have to find a bug.And that bug can take hours,it could take days to find,and that's torture.- Yeah, when your system\ngets sufficiently large,some of these bugs are just,\nthey are very difficult.Bless anyone's soul that's workingon million line code\nbases, because it does.I can't tell you how many\ntimes I've spent multiple daysjust trying to figure out\nthe root cause of the bug.Not even the fix.Just like why does this\nhappen? And that's hard.So I love that.I just love the asserts\nbecause I'm not good at them,I can see it's definitely a skillthat I don't put into practice constantly,which means it's just not like\na muscle memory type thing.And so it's just one of\nthose things I just love.It's such a fascinating\nway to approach a problem,because I would've never thought,you know what I'm gonna do?If I'm wrong, I'm gonna crash this thingand I'm gonna crash it right herebecause I should never be wrong.But instead you're like,\"Oh, actually that makes perfect sense.I should crash this thing.I've done something terribly wrong here.Why would this ever exist?\"And then you're like,\"This is gonna solve a\nwhole class of problems.\"- Yeah, and especially\nif it's in production,it's like, well a user's\ngoing to see this crash.It's like, yeah, well you should minimizethe number of times any\nuser ever sees the crash,not by having a nice blue\nscreen or whatever the fuck,but actually stopping everything.And that's going to create\nan incentive for youto never have that happen.You're actually going to put in the timeto make sure it never happens.- And the nice part is\nwith the web and all that,you can always pop up something and say,\"Hey, things have gone very, very wrongor unable to recover.\"You can give them a nice\nmessage and then log it offso you can see it, and then measurehow often are you doing it.I understand that there's\na bit of interestingnessto a web project like do you\nwant to always crash a server?There's a bit of a gamble\nif you release a bad versionand you crash all your servers constantly.That's a pain you're\ngoing to have to accept.- I think this is more\napplicable for single systemslike robots and so on.You have struggled with ADHD.I think a lot of people\nare really inspiredby the fact that you're able\nto be productive and flourishwhile having ADHD.How'd you overcome it?- Well, there's a lot of\nthings that ADHD affectsand soI'll start with some\nof the easiest things,because there's directly applicable,then these kind of collateral\ndamage applicable thingsthat happen.So one thing that has\nreally helped me with ADHDis maturity.I think that's just a thing\nthat everyone needs more of.Meaning that I found\nmyself getting so wigglyand so out of control when I\nwould try to sit down and read,and I just couldn't handle it.I just felt like I'd read a\npage and didn't read anything.The part of me that just went,\"Oh man, gosh, I just can't even do this.\"I had to just simply quit\nlistening to it and said,\"Nope, I'm rereading this page.\"I remember reading some pages in collegelike 18 times in a row, just\nlike I'm going to force myselfto just do this the correct way.And so there's an aspect of\nmaturity that really helps,no matter what, I will do\nthe thing I'm going to doand I'm going to do it welland maybe it takes me a\nlot longer and that's okay.That's not the point of it.It's that I'm doing it\nand that's the point.And so that's one thing that\nI think just generally helps.And ADHD, no ADHD,the resilience, emotional resilienceis just a really important\naspect that just helps.And so I think that has been a large partthat really helps me.There's things that I still\nobviously struggle with.It's clear where I'm really bad at stuff,andjust trying to think through\nall the different thingsthat I'm bad at.There's more things I'm\nbad at than I'm good at.And so programming obviously has somethingthat just allows me to remain focusedand it's like a strength of mine.And so I started offwhere I could just do it for a little bitand then just through kind\nof that emotional resilience,I was able to start\ndoing it more and more.And so now I can just do it\nfor like 10, 12, 15 hoursat a time and I absolutely love it.And so it's become kind of like a joy.It's like playing a musical\ninstrument. I'm really into it.But then if it came down to,\"Hey, you need to go\nschedule your own dentistryand go do all these other thingsor make sure the kids have\nthis type of stuff readyfor the meals you need to\npack throughout the week.I'm historically very bad at thatand will probably continue\nto be very bad at that.And so I must say that one of the reasonswhy I excel so much is\nbecause I also have a wifewho is so good to meand she helps clear out a\nlot of the things in my lifethat cause a lot of me\nkind of getting snowballedinto a weird spotwhere I'm just distracted\ngetting nothing done.And so she's really helped me.So it would be foolish of me to claimthat I've defeated the ADHD by myself,but instead I find that the placesthat I can really control\nI've done a very good job at,and the things that I obviously\nneed to do much better at,my wife has helped me a whole bunch.And so I've kind of cheated.Maybe I found a cheat code, a loving wife.But that has been the thing\nthat has really helped.- You said a lot of interesting things.So on the reading and for\nme it's also audiobook side,I do the same thing and I've\ngotten much better at it,which is I tune out mentallyand I read a pageand you don't understand\nanything on the page.You didn't actually read it.And yeah, I forced\nmyself to just reread itor re-listen to an audiobook,which is a much more\ncommon problem for me now,and forcing myself to\nreally pay attention.Because I listen to\naudiobooks often when I runand it's so easy to just tune out.It's a skill.I didn't realize how much of a skilllistening to an audiobook is,especially when there's\nother sensory inputslike when you run.So I have to force myself\nto really pay attentionto every single word.And if I don't, like tune\nout and don't rememberwhat I just listened to\nin the past 30 seconds,I force myself to re-listen to it.And sometimes that means five timesuntil, it's like punishing myself to like,\"You're gonna listen to this\nboring shit over and overuntil you get good at that\nlittle skill of like zoom in.\"And you're like, yeah, there's people,they're doing stuff, there's\nnature, it doesn't matter.You're listening to every\nsingle word and loading it inand trying to stay focused,even there's just so many\ndistractions all around you, yeah.- It's definitely a learned skilland it takes a lot of time.And when I say, \"Oh, I was\nable to do from here to here,\"I'm speaking over the\ncourse of like five yearsof doing this every day.It's not some small...There's no...The nice part about\nthat decision though isyou can make that decision today.You can make it right now.You're going to be\nlike, \"From here on out,I'll never make that mistake again.I will say I'm going to read 50 pages,I will sit down and read 50 pages,and when I get distractedI'll go back to the last place I rememberand I'll start again.\"And like that's a decision you can make.That's a mature, non-emotional\ndecision to make.And you can do that, it\njust may be really painfulfor the first couple years\nof making said decisions.And then it gets easier\nand then it gets easier,and then it becomes more\nnatural to change yourself.- Yeah, and with every\nmedium, with every platform,I think it's like a new skill.For me, like using social\nmedia has been that,just like I end up like doom scrollingtoo easily on platforms.And one solution is not to look at all,which is kind of what I\nlean on mostly these days,but I feel like I should be able to check,just read, okay, feel a thing,learn a thing, and then put it down,versus you have this\nglazed look over your eyeand you're not really\npaying attention anymoreand you're dead inside and\nyou feel horrible afterwards.I don't understand.- The horrible afterwards is real serious.I've definitely...I can 100% notice that I\nam a more anxious personthe more time I spend scrolling.- Yeah, yeah.\n- I can just feel it.It's like something inside\nof me that's kind of...I don't know how to say itother than it like wants to get outbut I don't really know what that is.It's not anger, but it's not...It's very anxious.- It's like the opposite\nof the feeling I havewhen I wake up in the\nmorning and I'm feeling good,and I look out in nature\nand look at the sunand just, and there's like a bird chirpingand this kind of thing.Scrolling through social media,even if it's like super\npositive stuff or whatever,it's still not the same\nfeeling as the bird chirping.Bird chirping on Instagramis a different bird\nchirping than in real life,'cause bird chirping on\nInstagram, I'll start swipinguntil there's demons of different typesfighting inside my head\nand then different anxiety,insecurity, whatever the hell.Just the mixture of chaosversus the bird chirping in real life.That is beautiful.But again, that's the same\nthing as with the audiobook.It boils down to...Man, these people that\ntalk about meditation,I think that's probably...They're onto something,because that's what it\nis be able to like focuscalmly and deliberately on a thing,whether it's reading or\naudiobook or existence.When they sort of observe the breath,you're able to silent out everything elseand remove everything else from focus.Yeah. That's a skill.That's a skill.- I heard it put really\nbeautifully, which is thatwe in America really have\nmisunderstood libertybecause we typically have libertyas just the freedom to\ndo whatever you want.And the argument wasthat it's not the freedom\nto do whatever you want,it's the freedom to be\nable to do what you will.And how often is what you\nactually want to do, you don't dobecause you get trapped doing somethingthat you've convinced yourselfin this quick moment you want to do?And so it's like, \"I want liberty.I want the ability to control my energyand to be able to do\nthe thing I want to do,not to get distracted and destroyedin all the millions of distractions.\"And some of us get handed\na worse deck of cards,some of us get a better deck of cards,but I don't think there's anybodythat doesn't struggle with\nit in the technological age.- Yeah, and that's the skill.What can you say to the\nskill of achieving focusin programming?Do you have a process of how you sit downand try to sort of approach a problem?So, all the different,\nnot just distractionsbut the challenges of starting a project,of thinking through the design,how to maintain real focus,because it's really difficult\nintellectual endeavor.- At this point I'm lucky,but when I first started I can rememberthat every last part of programming,I had to go look up, I had to go read,I had side quests at all time.Every step was a side quest.Why is my screen blinkingwhen I'm trying to render this thing out?Oh, I didn't know about double buffering.Why is this happening?How do I even write to the screen?How do I...Everything was a question.I had more questions than answers.And so I constantly had\nthe problem of side quests,and I find that to be a\nvery exhausting thing.But as I learned my\ninstrument very, very well,I don't have as many side quests.I become more and more able to just focuson the thing I want to do.And I find that to be somethingthat is just super, super useful.So, when I say I'm kind of lucky,meaning that I've spent so much of my lifepreparing for this momentthat now when I have the\nopportunity to do something,I can just do that thing and I don't...Like I can be just on an airplaneand I can just program for hours.I don't have to look up a single thing.I don't have to do anything.I don't even have to test the code.I can write 1,000 lines\nof code on an airplaneand I'm very confidentthat it's gonna be 98% pretty dang good.And I'm very happy about thatbecause that allows me\njust to be in the momentsolving the problem I'm trying to solve.Then I have 100% of my brain\npower solving a problem.And this is why I also...It's the same reason why I recommendlearning how to type and\nlearning your editor so wellyou don't even have to\nthink about the actionbecause the people that have to...Even if you just look down,that's still mental processing poweryou have to spend looking at a keyboardin which you already\nknow where the key is.You do.At this point, if you've been\ntyping for thousands of hours,you know where the key is,\njust stop looking down,you'll learn really quickly.And so it's like this\nthing where it's like,\"I'm not gonna spend all that timeand all that mental effort\nlooking up the thing.I'm gonna just memorize...I'm just gonna get it in\nme, and then I can go fast.\"And it feels good.And so that's how I'd\nkind of defeat that isbecause now I get to do somethingwhere it's like there's no more questions.It's now me just expressing myselfinto this medium and it feels really good.- I'm sure there's still\nlike things that pull at you,like curiosities, distractions, like,\"Ooh, I wonder how...\"Anytime you have access to the internet,you're gonna get like-- Twitter's a big one on that one. Yeah.- You're gonna get curious about stuff,including, I guess you're\nspeaking about everythingin the editors optimize,but, okay, you can always improve stuff.You can always find\nbetter plugins and macrosand, \"Oh, let me... You know what,this thing that took this pain point,I just found this tiny pain point,let me spend the next five\ndays creating a pluginfor my editor or whatever the fuckto remove that one pain point,\"when you should have just kept goingas opposed to taking side quests.- So, I have a rule which\nis I do not edit my RCother than some kind of cataclysmic thing,like someone updates a plugin,\nI didn't know they updated itand now there's like a\nhard error in my editorand I have to move forward.But I have a rule where I will edit my RC,my Neovim RC or anything once a year.Something that bothers\nme, I'll write it down,I'll remember it. I'll be like,\"Okay, I want to change that,\"but I will just not go back to it.Now, every now and then I'll\nbreak that rule if I know,if like, \"Oh, I want a new remapto be able to do this one commandand that takes literally 13\nseconds, like copy paste,do this, bop-bop-bop, done.Okay, I have this new remap,it made perfect sense in this situation,but I don't go plug-in exploring.I don't try to solve every problem.I don't want a perfect editor\nbecause that is a pursuitthat will never stop.I just go, \"This is good, good breakpoint,I won't do it again.\"So, last month I probably\nspent a hundred hoursjust editing every possible thing I couldabout how I start up my system and make...I can have a computer from zero\nto 60 in almost no time noweverything the way I exactly want it,Neovim and everything\nall perfectly set up.Happy enough, I'm not going\nto touch that system again.Maybe I'll touch it next year.\nMaybe I'll take a year off.It's just I'm fine with that.I'm fine with not being perfect.- All right, zero to 60, let's\ntalk about the perfect setup.What's your perfect programming setup,keyboard operating system,\nhow many screens, chair?- All right, I like all these.- IDE, let's go.- So, keyboard,you're using my favorite\nkeyboard right there,the Kinesis Advantage.Saved my career. Beautiful keyboard.Concavity and thumb clusters\nare just so importantbecause if you really think about it,especially if you're using qwerty,when you're pressing the\nsymbols on a standard keyboard,you're just doing this the whole time:Backspace, Enter, symbols.You're just doing this,and it just screws up your\nwrist constantly doing this.And this when you're constantly\ndoing like Ctrl and Shift.And it just is like messing you up,so it's just like right here.That's so much nicer in life.So, keyboard most important, I'd say.Get that one done.- For people who don't\nknow, Kinesis keyboard,I think the thing that\nyou experience the mostis exactly the thing you just said now,which is the backspace\nis really easy to pressversus what it is on normal keyboards.So, backspace in general\nsymbolizes you're deleting a thing,it symbolizes a mistake.Not symbolizes, it\nusually means a mistake.And so not only did\nyou just make a mistakein what you were typing,you also have to take a\nphysically painful action,annoying action to fix that mistake.And for most of us, we\nmake a lot of mistakes,so Kinesis just makes it pleasant and fastand easy physically to\ncorrect the mistake.That's probably for me the\nnumber one reason of Kinesis.Everything else, yeah,\nsuper plus with the macrosand the positioning, the\nconcavity like you mentioned,but their mistakes are pleasant.- Yeah. I am on that team,\nso that's why I love that.I would say that's one of\nthe most important things.The next thing that I find\nto be very, very importantis that one monitor.I'm a one monitor kind of guy.- What? Really?- So, when I program,\nwhen I do anything...Now, when I stream, I obviously\nhave a second computerthat runs the stream because\nI sometimes crash my computer,I have to restart or whatever.So, I do have a second screen\nthere that I put stuff up,but most of the time you'll noticethat even when I'm\nstreaming, you've been there,I have to physically switch\nto the streaming chat channelfor me to read it, and that'sbecause I'm operating off of one screen.And so I have this whole style\nin which I like to navigate,inspired by StarCraft,is that I believe in the press one key,go where you want to be mentality.And so everything about\nmy setup is press one key.So, when I want to go to Twitch\nchat, Alt+2, Twitch chat.When I want to go to my browser, Alt+1.That's my browser.Alt+3, that's where I\ngo to my programming.That's power finger, obviously.The big middle finger right\nthere, just smash it down.Alt+6 is going to be gimp,so my GNU image manipulation program,so if I want to draw, I go there.When I used to have Slack, it was Alt+5.If I have a spare terminalwhere I need to run some\nextra things, that's Alt+4.I had all these kind of...Everything is perfectly\nmapped out to single-key.And then when it comes\ndown to using, say, Tmux,I have all my terminals\ninto one single terminal.And now I'm able to kind\nof switch between there.Prefix one goes to my Vim editor.Whatever project I'm in, it's\nalways the first Tmux tab,if you will.I'm not sure... They call it\na session, but I'm not surehow to describe it if you're\nnot familiar with Tmux.A tab.Second one is like my spare terminal,third one is my long-running\nprocess terminal,my fourth one is a\nlong-running process terminal.So, I have it all set up,\nso every project I go toautomatically spawns session one: Vim,session two: spare terminal,session three will also open it,so it's like, brrrrr,\neverything's just ready to rock.Everything has been\noptimized to where I do that.If I want to go to a project, it's Ctrl+F,and any terminal will\nbring up a fuzzy find listof every one of my folders\non my operating systemin which I can go to with\njust a couple keystrokesand, boom, I'm in that one now.And so it's very oriented to findwhere I need to be as quickly as possible.- Via keyboard.- Via keyboard.Then in Vim I developed\na plugin called Harpoon,which is I press one buttonand I can pin one of the files\nto like a temporary buffer.I think Projectile is potentially\nclose to this in Emacs.I can't remember if Projectile...I think Projectile is closer\nto my sessionizing script.Anyways, so now I have four pinned filesin which I can go to any\nof those pinned fileswith just a single keystroke.And so now it's just like...Because every time you develop a feature,usually you have like three filesyou're kind of primarily working in.And I can fuzzy find for the\nother files and that's that,but usually I just have\nlike these three power filesthat I'm always swapping in between.And so it's like now everything is just,\"I want go to the\nbrowser.\" That's one press.\"I want to go to my\nworkstation.\" That's one press.\"I want to go to a specific folder,I need to change folders.\"Sometimes you work between\ntwo different projects,so in Tmux that's prefix,capital L will swap between your last two.So, I have alternate projects,so I can even swap between\nprojects in pretty much one key.So, it's just like do-do-do,\njust trying to optimize it,so I don't think as much,because I think search\nfatigue is a massive failwhere you have to look for it.When I see people on a Mac do thisand then explode all the different ones,that gives me anxiety.I'm like, \"Why are you using your eyeballsto search for what you want to do?\"Make it into a key pressand never think about it again, ever.- You're making me think a lotwhether I can live with your system,whether it's better\nbecause it feels better.- It at least intellectually feels better.It may not be great for some people.- Well, there's a few\nprofound things you said,which is like really what,the number of windows or tasks\nyou're switching between,whether it's programming,the number of files you're working on,it's small at any one time,at any one space of 20 minutes\nor something like that.So, okay, that's a profound truth.Sometimes we think like,\"Oh I need the full freedom to search,\"but you don't.You usually work on a very small slice.But I guess the trade-off there...I always have three monitors,\nnot when I'm traveling,but my happy place is three monitors.It's like, do you really need all of themto be present there?So, you're turning your head.Now, the monitors I have\nis two vertical ones,which is just better for\ncertain kinds of content.They're positioned\nvertically, so you can read.You can use your eyes to scan quickly.- Interesting. So, I don't even do that.I even have it so zoomed inthat I probably only have\nlike maybe 25 lines of codeat any one time on my 27-inch monitor.- Yeah, I think that's...I think I feel fundamentally constrainedwhen I can't see morebecause your eyes are\njust good at jumping.Like, okay.Like you could...- Why not search? Why not\npress a couple of keystrokes?Ctrl+U, Ctrl+D, jump up\nand down by a half page.- Because the ape visual\nsystem was designed to...You're loading a lot of information.If every time you have to\ninvestigate this table,what's on this table, you\nhave to press a keystroke,you could develop the skillsetthat integrates that\ninformation but it's really...There is an effective thingwhere if you have a\nsheet of paper like thisand I'm looking at it,my eyes will be able to load inthe structure of the information,the topics of the information.You just can do it faster, I think.There's a big cost because\nit's an extra monitor,but there is some stuff that's verticalwhen vertically positioned.See, code is an iffy one codebecause code, you really,25 lines at a time, I\nthink you can do a lot.This is more for like articlesand especially with\nvisual information in themor documentation, you\ncan just jump faster.But I'm trying to...As you were speaking so eloquently,I was like wondering,\"Am I just like deceiving\nmyself that I need that?Can I just keyboard\nshortcut-ify everythingand just have everything on one monitor?\"That's something I should probably trybecause I'm a big proponentof just automating\neverything with the keyboardbecause you can just\nmove really, really fast,and you don't have to think.Because I also do creative stuff,whether it's recording\nmusic or video editing.It's hard...Some of these programs still\nmake it super easy for you.On Windows, with AutoHotkey\nyou can do quite a lot,but still there's limitations onhow much you can do with the keyboard.So, it really is a pain in the\nass to have to use the mouse,but, man, you're really making me think.- Even the text one, the reading one,fundamentally I think I agree with you,that you can see a lot moreand you can kind of look up and down,and see those two things.And probably in articles\nor things like that,if there's a graph down\nhere that's really bigthat take up your whole screen plus text,I could see why that would be\nvery beneficial to zoom out,to be able to have all that information,but for me, I can only\nlook at like a square inch.Really, that's all my eyes\ncan actually focus on.So, when I'm reading, I'm right here.Then I have to structurally\ntry to pattern matchwhat I think the information looks like.Then I have to start reading it.So, I'm not exactly sure if I\nactually get any real benefitof having a lot of stuff on screen,as opposed to I can relax my eyes so muchI don't even have to focus.The words are so big. I actually\nprogram pretty zoomed in.My text is bigger than\nthis when I program,and so it's just that it's so comfortable,I don't even have to exert\nany effort to read the code.- But you have to kind of\ntrain your brain to knowthat you can navigate\nspatially using keys.- Yeah, Neovim by the way.- Oh, maybe it has everything\nto do with Neovim. Okay.- All right. And then Neovim\nis obviously the next big one.I love Neovim.Reason being is that I think\nyou can make all the argumentsthat you want about\nwhich editor is the best.I do not think you can make an argumentthat Vim motions aren't superior.- Here we go. Can you explain Vim motions?What is this?So, Neovim.Vim is an old school editor.Neovim-- It's a modern take on\nan old school editor.- Yeah. And what's ELI5?What does it take to work with Neovim?- Oh, okay.I thought you were talking\nabout a Vim motion there.That's how...I know, but you know that\nmeme that's just like,\"Hey, Jarvis, can I tell\nyou about Vim motions?\"Because they can't fit\nanything else in their headbecause they only have Vim motions.You said EL5, explain it like I'm five,but in my head it's like,\"Okay, E is jump to the end of the word,L is the one more...\"Dude, I'm so broken that I'm\nlike, \"Okay, Vim motion,\"when I hear letters.Yeah, so, you can think\nof it like this is thatVim has a language to\ndescribe movements in textbecause its primary mode of\noperation is manipulatingor editing text.So, it is a well-thought\nthrough set of movements,deleting, yanking, pasting,copying, all that kind\nof stuff that goes in,motions that are optimized for workingwith pretty much code.A good example, say you\nhave three lines of codeyou want to delete.If you're in VS Code, take\nyour little beautiful mouse,highlight those things,\npress the backspace.That's lovely. Your\nhand left the keyboard.Very simple to do though.\nIt's very beginner friendly.I was a huge Vim hater, by the way,so I just want you to know\nthat before we go into this.I was probably the biggest Vim hater.If there was Saul to Apostle Paul,I am like the Saul to Apostle Paul of Vim,just so you can see how big the gap was.Or you can do something that's like...I don't know what the VS Code shortcut is,but I'm sure there's\nsome keys you can pressto delete the current line you're on.Delete, delete, delete,\nyou can just do that.In Vim, I can go DAP,\ndelete around paragraph.All contiguous code in that thing.I'm going to delete, so D,then I can choose my\nmotion I want to take,AP, around paragraph.Or maybe I want to DF, meaning\njump up to the next characterthat matches the next\ncharacter I'm going to press.So, DF opening parenthesis\nwill delete everythingfrom your cursor up to the\nfirst opening parenthesis.So, you get to describe your motionin these little keystrokes.And as you get really good...You've seen people that\ncan master Fortnite,it's the same thing with\nmastering Vim motions.When you get so good, you no longer thinkabout each individual movement,and instead you're just like,\n\"Get rid of the paragraph,jump here, jump this, highlight\nthis, yank this, do this,\"it becomes so fast that you\ncan superiorly edit textat a very fast rate.And there comes a pointwhen you know your language really well,you know the problem you're\nreally working on really well,where editing text and getting code outactually becomes one of\nthe many bottlenecks.People always talk about, \"Well,\nmost of the time I think.\"Most of the time I'm not\nthinking, I'm programming.I know what I want to do, I\nwant to go as fast as possiblebecause I've been just\ndoing it for so longand I'm so familiar with the general spacethat it becomes a huge problem for me.I cannot tell you how many timesthat I've been purely\nbottlenecked by the factthat I just can't type fast enoughand I just need to get it out of my headonto the text editor.And so that's why I think\nVim motions are superiorin all aspects.Keep your hands on the\nkeyboard, on the home row,and it can manipulate text\nin very wide and fast ways.- Oh, so, this is not\njust about writing text,this is about modifying text.It's primarily about modifying text.- Yes.\n- And I'm surethat most editors including Emacs,including VS Code can do\nall those same things,but there is something...They just don't encourage\nyou to discover those things.That's like an important thing\nabout a lot of technologiesand programming languagesthat a lot of them can\ndo a lot of the stuff,but it's something about\nwhether it's the communityor the style of the language\nor anything like thisthat encourages you to not\nbe lazy in the beginningand learn the fast way to edit text,in this particular example,\nhow to use the keyboard.That's a fascinating just reality\nof how technology is used.You want to be encouraged\nto find the fast thingas quickly as possible so that long termit's efficient and fun to use the thing.- It takes a long time for\ndividends, like a long time,but on top of that,\nnotice I didn't say Vim.I'm not saying, \"Go use Vim,\"I'm saying, \"Vim motions.\"Let me give you one more\nexample. I'm a big fan.Let's say you have a line\nthat contains some variable,some function you're calling somethingthat takes in a string. And\nyou need to do that again,so you would typically copy that line,you'd paste that line below,you'd go into the string\nand you'd change the string.Let's say it's calling\nsome sort of configuration,you need to call it three timeswith three different configuring strings.In Vim, I like to do shift-V\nto highlight the whole line,and then Y.Some people do YY, but I\ndon't like to do double ones.I like to be able to do\ntwo different fingersbecause you can do that way\nfaster than one finger twice.It's just a little optimization for mebecause you can't press that as fast.So, anyways, I'm very\noptimized in my approach,so I yank the line, paste the line.CI double-quotes will delete everythinginside the first occurring string.Then I can type the string, escape, save.And so it's like so optimizedthat I can just jump so\nfast in between that,whereas the copying and pasting lineis probably the same speed,but the navigating to the string,deleting what's currently\nin the string, and then...That's such a fast motion in Vim,and I just do that all the time.- To backtrack, really dumb question,CI, what's the difference\nbetween typing the lettersand using the letters\nto navigate and edit?How do you switch between the two modes?- Okay, so insert mode meansthat you're just putting in text,and then normal mode means\nthat you're moving your cursor.- [Lex] And how do you\nswitch between the two?- Escape. Escape goes from\ninsert mode into normal mode.And to go into insert mode press Ito take your current cursor\nand go to the beginning,A to go to the end of the year Cursor,capital A to go to the end of the line,capital I to go to the beginning of line,O to put a new line below\nand then put your cursorat the proper intended for the language,Shift+O to shift your current line down,and then put a new line in.You can see, there's a lot-- So, you're pressing Escape a lot.- Yeah, I mapped mine. I do Ctrl+C.Ctrl+C does the same thing\nexcept for in one edge case.People hate that.I got used to it just due to the factthat I was using IntelliJ,and I really hate pressing the Escape key,so I just got used to pressing escapee.- That seems like an essential thing to doif you're using Neovim to\nmap escape to something.- Cap lock would be your standard go-to.- Oh yeah, I map it too.\nCool. I got you. I got you.- Yeah, so then it's just\nreally easy to press it,and boom, boom, boom,\nnot a big deal at all.But yeah, I think that if\nyou're willing to learn it,Vim motions are superior,but if you're not willing to learn it,then they're not superior.You should just not do it.If you're willing to\nendure pain, it's good.If you're not, it's actually way worse.It's 100 worse.- Right, so if you like\npain, you use Neovim.Totally. I understand.- You're totally on-board.\n- 100%.- See, now you get it.- If you like joy, you use Emacs.- Sorry, sorry, did Emacs\never get a good text editor?I know they're a great operating system,but I never caught up if\nthey got a good text editor.- Operating system?I think you've been miseducated my friend.So, at least 30 minutes\non Emacs versus Neovimis what Reddit requested.Have you actually used Emacsin order to be able to\ntalk so much shit or no?- I used it for a year.- You used it for a year?- Yeah, yeah. Doom Emacs,\nSpacemacs and regular Emacs.- But you don't even know\nLisp, so did you really use it?- I kind of hacked my\nway through kind of like,\"Okay, so this is how to configure...\"You can kind of get your\nway through and do all that.- So, you recommend to mastering Neovimand really learn the depths of it,but Emacs is okay to just kind of usebefore making a judgment.I think everybody...\n- You got me on that one?- Yeah, no, and what's\nNeovim written? It's Lua?- Yeah, so Lua would be\nthe configuration language,but you have...It's written in C, but you have Lua 4.And Lua is just a dead simple language.Anyone can program Lua.- I actually don't know why...I think it's because my love for Lispthat I went with Emacs.I think you just choose a path\nand you walk down that path.And because there's just such a vibrant,intense battle between\nthe two communities,you just start fightingjust because everybody else is fighting.And then one day you're\nan old warrior on a horse,and you're wondering,\n\"What was this all for?\"And it's quite sad,in all seriousness,that I haven't to this day tried Neovim.I think because there is a learning curve.There's a learning curve\nto a lot of these editors.- Yeah. To really learn it.- To really learn it.And I think this is some of the criticismof maybe VS Code or Sublime or Atomthat it's so easy to not learn it,to just kind of halfass use it.And there is a big\nbenefit to having editorsthat force you to have\nsome learning curve,where you take the art,the science, the procedure\nof editing seriously.Because you spend so much time in it,you might as well learn\nhow to use the thing.- My big takeaway really,what I'm trying to say\nwith all these words isthat I honestly don't\nactually think that...The editor obviously does\nnot make the programmer,but I think it says a\nlot about your characteras a programmer if you don't knowhow to use your editor well.There's something about a personwho's willing to commit\ntheir life to programming,and spending literally 50,000 hoursdoing an activity over the\ncourse of their lifetime,and never take the time\nto learn their editorthrough and through.It just seems strange.You'd never see that in another world,where people would be\nable to build somethingor do something and just completely forgethow these things work,and only just focus on\none part of their craft.And so, to me, it's just\nlike it doesn't matterhow you use it, I want to see the personthat just knows how to use it,and they know how to use it well.When there's a problem, they\ncan say why the problem exists,and then go and fix the problem.To me, that's like, There\nyou go. You've done it.You now know your tool, go forth\nand conquer with said tool.- Especially for tools you use a lot.(ThePrimeagen chuckles)You have to look at your whole\nlife, your life, whatever,if you're a developer or anything,what is the thing you do a lot?- Meetings.- Yeah, yeah.- Sorry. Keep going, keep going.- Ask a question like: how\ncan this be done a lot better?Because every single day you do thisfor hours a day,how many hours did you spend on thinkinghow to do this better or\nwhether to do it at all,in the case of meetings?People surprisingly just\ndon't do this enough.I see this, just to go back to jujitsu,there's a lot of people that show upand do jujitsu or martial arts,\nand they do it the same wayover and over and over,and they invest tremendous\namount of energy.And they don't ask like,\"How do I do it differently\nto improve faster?\"In the case of jujitsu\nor any kind of sport,same with practicing\nthe piano or the guitar,they just religiously put in a lot of timeand derive a lot of joy\nfrom getting better.They don't enough ask the\nmeta question of like,\"How can I do this better?\"And with editors, it's surprisinglyhow often people do just that.With typing, it's surprising\nhow many people do just that.Like you said, they're\npecking or looking down.It's like the quality of\nlife improvement you can haveby learning to touch type,by just like typing without looking.It's immeasurable.You're bringing a lot of joy to your lifebecause all of us are typing a lot.And the reason, by the way,I was extremely efficient with Emacs.I'm sure you know, all jokes aside,it feels like Neovim has more roomfor the kind of efficiency\nI've had with Emacsto be able to move really fast\nas you described me to edit.There is a real joy.It's not just efficiency,it's a freedom that you can getwhen you get really good with an editor.The reason I chose to go\nwith VS Code is it felt likethere's going to be an\nacceleration of featuresto which Neovim or Emacswill not be able to catch up, in the...And I don't mean in the next five years,I mean in the next 30 years.And it felt like I almost\nwanted to take the painof learning new editors constantlyand just switching and learning that,because I was getting\nso comfortable in Emacs,with this Kinesis keyboard,\neverything, all the shortcuts,I know how to program, and\nit felt like this is not...Neovim will not be here in 50 years.Possibly might be, I don't know,but it felt like you want to learnthese constant different technologies.Cursor is a great example of that.I primarily am using Cursor now.I go back between VS Code and Cursor.Just the skill of using\nAI is a real skill,from the shortcuts to the timingto the layout of the\nwindows to how I think aboutwhere, when and how to use the\nAI that doesn't distract me,that it empowers me,not just for the fuck of\nit or for the fun of it,for the actual measure of productivity.It's a skill.And I feel like I would be stuckin a local maximum of comfort\nif I stayed with Emacs.And maybe the same should\nbe true for me with Neovim.I should try it seriously.I'm sure there's a plugin, like\na copilot type of situationthat you could set up with Neovim.I should possibly consider that.But Cursor is doing a lot\nof really fascinating stuffon the IDE side, not just\nsort of generate codeand edit that code manually,it's like continuously\nbe able to rewrite code.It's the idea of tab, tab, tab, tab,move the Cursor around, but\nalso modify parts of codeand do the diff really nicely,that whether it's Cursor or VS Codethat wins that battle out\nwith Copilot, I don't know.But that feels like a\nfundamentally different experiencethan the really efficient,\njoyful experiencethat you just describedin your selling me on this is Neovim.That doesn't have an AI in the picture,obviously immediately, but\nyou can, yeah, absolutely.- I would 100% agree thatCursor seems like such a cool product.I actually think there's a\nlot of really neat thingscoming down with all of that.And I could change from Neovim.I don't use Neovim because I love Neovim,I use Neovim because I\nlove the instrument I play.And so it's like if Cursor\ncan meet those needs,I could see myself moving over.I don't have some sort of\nobsessed attachment with it.I am curious though that\nevery time I use AI...I think I just have skill issues.I think I'm just so\nriddled with skill issueswhen it comes to using AI, I\nhave yet to be able to use itin a way that I really love it.- We'll talk about it, but before then-- Oh, ball to sit on. I forgot\nto say that, ball to sit on.Desk needs to be properly heighted.One monitor. Eyes should be\ntwo-thirds way up the screen.I don't like to turn my head.I prefer my hands in a\npistol neutral position.And there we go.- A ball to sit on. Yoga ball.- Yoga ball.- What's that about?- It just helps just\nmaintain good posture,because when I have something\nto lean against, I do this.- You're for hours sitting without...Wait, what are you doing?- I sit on the ball, and then I bounce.- Is your back leaning on a thing?- No.- What the fuck?- Well, how else do you-- You're the only person in the\nworld sitting on a yoga ballas you program for hours.\nYou do realize this, right?- It feels great.The problem is whenever I\nget a back, I just slouchand I find myself just\ngetting uncomfortable.And I'm like, \"I'm uncomfortable.\"My shoulders are getting goofed up.I'm chicken necking constantly.It's just like...- But you're able to keep your posturefor hours on the yoga ball?- Yeah. And so I can just do that.And then I find myself, if I slouch,I'm like, \"Okay, Nope. Got to get back.- Do you have incredible\nback muscles or what?- No, well, I don't thinkit takes incredible back muscles to-- Keep posture.\n- remain upright.Yeah, I think that's a\npretty basic human function.I would not consider\nmyself a strong person.- Yeah. Basic human function.I don't know.- [ThePrimeagen] Facts and logic.- Okay, cool. With one screen.Neovim. What operating system?- Linux, just because I\nwant a good window manager.That's the whole press one\nbutton, bring up Chrome.I just use i3.I'm sure I could use\nsomething better than i3.People always tell me\nall these window managersare really great.But I just have those three\nscreens I switch between,so it doesn't really... I\ndon't really care what I use,just long as I can\npress one button and go.- Yeah, I'm the same, so half and half.Half Linux, the other\nhalf Windows with Linux,meaning WSL.What's that? Windows Subsystem for Linux.- Weasel.- Weasel.See, no, there's got to be a better onethat's more positive.Weasel just sounds-- Seems right up Microsoft's\nalley. That seems perfect.- People often accuse me of\nbeing a shill for somebody,sometimes dictators.If I'm a shill for\nanybody, it's for Windows.There you go.I get paychecks every week from-- Dang. Bought by Bill Gates.- Well, he's not Microsoft anymore.- [ThePrimeagen] I know.- Developers, developers,\ndevelop. No, I'm just joking.I think, man, I need to try Mac.I need to try.I'm surrounded by people with iPhones.I use Android.\n- I use the Android.- Yeah. There you go.See? Oh.- We're losers together.- Losers on a sinking ship.Okay, just to stay on Neovim for a secand to give love and a\nshout-out to your friend, Teej.- [ThePrimeagen] He Streams, by the way.- He's a streamer. And I subscribed.And I've been enjoying it.My allegiance is slowly\nshifting from you to him.The quality is far superior with him,the looks, the intelligence, the skillset,everything, just far superior.No. Okay, so he...- You know you're making his day.(Lex laughs)- All right.He mentioned that he loves Neovimbecause it gives him\nthe ability to eliminatehaving to do things he doesn't like.That's just a nice way to framewhat this automation processthat you described of automating a way,assigning shortcuts to\nthings that are painful,that procedure.I wonder if you agree with that.- Fully agree.We have very similar mentalitieswhen it comes to usage of\nNeovim, why people should use it,all that kind of stuff, and\nhow to even use it well.He definitely takes it\nprobably to a further degree.He spends more time\nautomating and all that.I don't necessarily derive a lot of joyfrom getting the perfect setup.But a lot to learn from.He's very, very good at what he does.He is by far probably one of these...He's 30 years old, been\nprogramming for not too many years,and he is one of the most\ntalented developers for sure.It's very shocking to see\nhow smart someone can be.- People should check him out at teej_dv.- Yep.\n- Teej.- DV, is last name is DeVries. DeVries.- Oh, it's not developer. Okay, cool.- Yeah, yeah, it's just TJ.That's just his name just spelled fun.- All right, Teej. What\ndo you love about him?- Wow. How much did he pay\nyou to ask these questions?- Thousands of dollars.- Just so many dollars.\n- Thousands.I can't even count that many dollars.- Trust, obviously trust is\nthe biggest thing, especiallyin the, quote, unquote,\n\"streaming\" YouTube world,if you will.It's very easy to find peoplethat will want to be a part of stuff.People tend to latch onto\nthings, and it's very hardto find someone that you\ncan really, really trust.And so he's just somebody\nwhom I can genuinely trust.He will always tell the truth.He's all the right\nthings for a good friendin this kind of endeavor.- As a good friend, he told mequestions I could backstab you with.- Okay, I hate him. I forgot\nhow much I don't trust him.- Speaking of a harpoon, you mentioned it.He said to ask youbasically how many years or\ndecades it's going to taketo transition to Harpoon\n2 to actually release it,develop it, and so on.Can you describe what Harpoon isand why your seem to be incapableof finishing a single project?- That was a lovely framed question.Harpoon 2 is actually done.This is what I did: To avoid the swirlin the thousands of questions\nI will inevitably get,I kept the master branch as Harpoon 1,and I've kept Harpoon\n2 as Harpoon 2 branch.And people that don't\nread the read me to saythat I just use Harpoon 2\nnow, that's their fault.That's it.I really don't like answering\nhundreds of questionsabout open source stuff.I used to love doing\nopen source and all that,but I got my soul crushed\nduring the Falcor years,and so I guess I'm just allergicto being a really active maintainer.I build everything just for me.Harpoon's just literally\njust built for me.I spent three months trying to figure outthe most optimal navigation for files,and that's what I came up with.Harpoon, it's a take on alternate file.If you're familiar with\nthe alternate file,typically you'll have this in all editorswhere you can go back to\nthe file you were just in.And so that means you can\nhave effectively two filesyou swap back and forth in.\nYou've probably used it a bunch;really fast way to navigate.Pretty nice thing to do.I want alternate file, but\nthree of them or four of them,and so that's all Harpoon isis just being able to pin a file.And so I have one button\nto press to go to a file,another for another, another for another.And so I can have up to four.I just had my four power fingers.For Dvorak, what is that? That's HTNS.If I go Ctrl H, T, N, or S,it goes to one of the four files.And that's it. That's all it is.And you can technically make\nit so you can add in functionsand be able to execute things externally.You can open up terminals,you can send requests off to servers.You can do anything you want with it,I just have it primarily\ndesigned for opening files.- Since you mentioned it, what\nkeyboard layout do you use?You use Dvorak?- I use Dvorak, but I used\na custom version of Dvorak.The reason why I used it is in 2017,we are just having my second kid,it was Christmas and I'm\nhaving so much pain in my armand I'm sitting there freaking out like,\"Oh my gosh, is this the end of my career?Am I done programming? Is this all over?\"And so I decided that I was goingto create my own keyboard layout optimizedto prevent the pain that I'm experiencing,so I used to Dvorak as the baseand then laid out the\nsymbols in a symmetrical,reasonable way so that\nit's opening, closing,opening, closing, opening, closing.And they all are right here.I actually have to hold\nshift to press a number.Symbols are actually my\nfirst thing I get to press.And so it's very optimized\nfor a laptop keyboard layoutso I can use my laptop in\na very efficient, nice way.That's how I got started\non Dvorak and all that.I wouldn't actually recommend itbecause I didn't have\na Kinesis at the time.I didn't even know Kinesis\nexisted at that time.And so when I discovered\nKinesis in also 2017,that's when I was like, \"Oh, okay.\"- Would you recommend Kinesis to people?- I'm technically sponsored by Kinesis,so it's hard for someone\nto believe someonethat's sponsored by it.But I did use it before\nI ever became sponsored.They're the only sponsor that\nI reached out to and said,\"I need a sponsorship from you.I'm going to use you either way.You can say no, but I really love it.\"And for the first three\nyears of using Kinesis,they gave me free Kinesises,\nKenisi, as my sponsorship.- Kenisi. Yeah, I'm always torn.I tried to leave so many times.- You can't. It's too good.- But, see, I have this absurd situationof traveling with it.- I relate. (chuckles)- Yeah. I'm literally going\nto the war zone in Ukraine.I have a Kinesis keyboard, (chuckles)a laptop, and just a few other\nsmall things and that's it.And it's like is Kinesis\nkeyboard really going to be 30%of volume that you're\nbringing to a war zone?- Looks like the answer is yes.- Yeah. Do you really\nderive that much value?I think it's probably spiritual\nor psychological for me.It feels like home.There's comfort associated with it.I try to leave.- I love this experience.It's like a relationship\nyou have with the thing.- It is.But I'm trying to figure outif it's a toxic relationship or not.I think it's mostly\nlove. I think it's love.Like all relationship, there's somepush and pull complications, but-- They say that distance\nmakes the heart grow fonder,so maybe sometimes the Kinesis keyboardneeds to stay at home and the\nlaptop keyboard can be the oneso that your heart grows even more fondand that connection grows even deeper.- I already miss it as you\nsay it, so I don't know.I think it's coming\nalong to all the trips.If it breaks down, though...I was worried that Kinesis\nwas shut down as a company.I'm like, what's the business model here?Who actually uses these keyboards?But apparently they're still going strong.- Yeah. Who uses these keyboards?As you use the keyboard\"I have to take it with me everywhere.\"I wonder who uses these keyboards.- Yeah. Yep.I should mention that one of the thingswhen I first became a fan of yours,I heard you talk about coffee and term...I still don't, by the way, understandwhat you're even talking about.\nI need to actually use it.But you run, amongst many\nthings, a coffee company.Man, this smells so good.This one is dark mode, dark\nroast, whole coffee beans.There is seg origin, dash,\ndash location. Brazil.- Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff on there.- Stuff on there that's very devy.Shop, server, web.Can you legit, as such,\norder coffee via SSH?- As of right now,it's the only way you can\nget the coffee is via SSH.Okay, can I just origin, origin story you?- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right.I was going to do some\nkind of command line.Command to request or dash\ndash help or something or-- Command coffee?\n- Command coffee.- Okay, TJ and I, again,\nsame Teej, Teej TV, about...By the way, very amazing\ndesigns done by David Hill.They're very, very good.\nLet me give the basic ideas.It must've been about\na year and a half ago,TJ and I were talking like,\"Hey, every one of these peoplethat have some sort of following,some sort of online presence,they're always selling a thing,\"but I got nothing to sell.I don't really want to do merch.I've never really enjoyed doing merch.I just find that, I don't know,it's just not as much fun for me.- Don't want to have a tequila?- I don't want a tequila.I want something that-\n- Like The Rock.- And I also want somethingthat I really don't\nfeel bad about selling.There's a lot of people\nthat will go on the internetand they'll shill for a\nwhole bunch of products like,\"Oh, okay, try this, try this.\"And this is why I've only\never really done Kinesis isbecause it's like, well,\nI can point to somethingthat was really bad in my\nlife, I was very scared,and now it's not bad anymore.It's like, okay, that one made sense.But everything else always has\nbeen... It's harder for me.And so we just talked for\nso long, and we love Neovim,so we're just like,\"Why haven't we could do\nsomething from Neovim?\"And we're laughing about that,ordering from Neovim\nis just so ridiculous.And then at some point, we're just like,\"Well, wait a second.And maybe we could do coffee.\nEvery developer loves coffee.Maybe we could figure out\nthis coffee business.\"And so I had a good\nfriend named Dax, THDXR.Dax, yeah, Dax. The\nmost sassiest man alive.- Sassiest?- Oh yeah, he has a lot of sass.- Beard?- Yep, he has a beard.He does SST. He does a lot of stuff.Very, very talented. We'll\ncall him DevOps engineer.He's more than that.\nBut very talented guy.Him and another person named\nAdamdotdev, vegan, by the way,great guy. We take him to\nKorean barbecue all the time.He eats nothing.- That's great.- And Liz, she has been super importantto the terminal coffee company.I think without her, we would\nnot have been able to dowhat we have done.And then also David Hill,\ndesigner, he does Laravel.He designs for Laravel.\nVery talented designer.And so we all came together.And we were just laughing\nabout how could we do somethingthat's just ridiculous? And\nthat's what we came up with.Yeah, there you go. You\njust open the website.You literally cannot order.We actually do not allow you to order.- The website is something\nthat looks like the terminal.Use command below to order your\ndelicious whole coffee bean.SSH terminal.shop.- Yeah. You can only SSH into it.You have to copy that command\nand throw it in there.If you want to add in\nthe little terminal shopfor your known hosts, you could do that.- How do you handle payment?- Through Stripe.And so one of the things, we'll\nbe adding a mobile checkoutto where I'll show a\nQR code in the terminaland you can just check out\non your phone, but right now,you enter in your credentials,\nit goes to Stripe.- [Lex] Via all terminal, like SSH.- Yeah, SSH, obviously it\nstands for Secure Shell.It uses elliptical quantum safe algorithmsto ensure that your data's\nnot being intercepted.- Yeah, but does he use AI?- I'm pretty sure Dax uses AI.- Quantum AI?\n- Can this-- Fusion quantum AI?\n- Can this even be a companyif it's not using AI?- We have some crypto\nchains with some quantum AIthat's powered by Fusion,\n- Great.- so it's pretty wild.Anyway, yeah, we just came\ntogether where we thought,what is the...That was from the Mike Tyson fight.It was literally that night\nMike Tyson kissed the reporterand then walked out without any clothes.We did an ad for somebody.- Nice.\n- But we decidedto make a coffee shop, and then we thoughtinstead of just making it Neovim,what if we made it from SSH?Because everybody has\nSSH. You have VS Code.Launch VS Code. You can order\ncoffee from within VS Code.Because your little bottom\nterminal that has access to SSH,bada bing, bada boom.It's fun, and so we really-- I love this.\n- We just wanted to dosomething where there's no\nlevel and there's no worldthat makes me feel bad about selling thisand people buying it.It's good, ethical coffee.We developed the entire\nsupply chain and everything.It's all packaged, it's all boutique.It's pretty high-end coffee.It tastes really, really good.- At this point, I don't\nlike drinking other coffee.I get upset about it\nbecause it's not as good.And so it's funny that I've\nfallen for my own stuff.I'm high on my own supply\npretty hard right now.I just got done ordering 16 bagsand gave it out to my family\nto try to convince them.But it's just something where it's likeI didn't sell you a software productthat's going to influence your startupthat could potentially lead to disaster,I didn't convince you\nto do a bunch of stuffthat's going to change\nyour career, I just said,\"Hey, here's some coffee.\"And it's like a fun experience.- Yeah, it's fun, everything.The humor on it is great.People should go to terminal.shop.- SSH terminal.shop.- I'm speaking to people\nthat don't know what SSH is.And there, you can read the commandand then figure out how\nto use SSH in order to...It's a kind of documentation, right?- Yeah.\n- On the website.- If you can't use SSH,you probably should just not\nworry about buying our coffee.Like that's the-- You can learn.\n- You can learn.If you're active and\nyou're a computer person,you'd like to launch the terminaland feel like a hacker, go for it.We even have subscriptions.- What I would love to see...This is how it came up I think\non the cursor conversation,is that I would love it\nif an AI agent did this,like Anthropos computer\nuse or something like that,actually took the action\nof ordering the coffeewhile it was programming.- Yeah, like, \"Hey, order me some coffee,\"and it actually go off.\"Give me dark roast.\" Order coffee.It could actually go through\nthe whole flow of order.- Yeah, the whole flow.But even better, if you\ndidn't ask it to order coffee,you asked it to do something,and as a tangent, as a\nside quest it did that.Which is computer use does that.They showed off that it's\nable to go to I think Googlefor some images, take a pause,and then continue doing other stuff.Anyway, yeah, super cool idea. Love it.Speaking of which, let's talk AI.- All right.- You've been both positive\nand negative on the role of AIin the whole programming\nsoftware engineering experience.As it stands today, what do you think?What's your general view about AI?What is it effective at?\nWhat is it not so good at?- Okay, my general view isit comes down to something\nthat's pretty simple,which is that if you're doing somethingin which is very predictable,\nAI is really nice.When you're doing something\nthat is just not predictable,AI is not very nice to use.If you're using anything\nthat's more cutting edge,AI will not be using it,or AI won't be very good\nat doing stuff with it.It's not great at Zig because Zig is just,say, less documented. It's\nreally great at TypeScript.I think there's a lot\nof interesting thingsthat are going to come down through AIthat I think a lot of people\naren't really prepared foror thinking through.TJ's the genesis of this\nidea, but the idea thatI think there's going to be\na lot of market manipulation,if you will, through AI.Meaning, hey, you want to research,say, best woodworking tools.Someone's going to be buying an ad spot.Someone's going to be buying\npremium training data.They're the ones that get\nthe big boosts in the LLMs.But LLMs don't really have\nto market as an advertisementbecause it's not really\ndirectly an advertisement,they just had a more premium spot, per se,in the training data; a little\nbit extra learning to it.It's like there's a lot of things about AIthat I fear upcoming.A lot of it just comes\ndown to people not learningor making the trade-offwhere productivity is the\nonly thing that matters.And I don't think productivityis the only thing that matters.If you want to build something\ncomplex and difficult,productivity is not the only thing.You actually are going to\nhave to do deep learningand pursue it beyond the basics.And so I see AI as this really cool thing.It feels like a magic trick.I remember the first time I used it,I got early access to GitHub Copilot.In fact, Nat Friedman\nsaw my Twitch clip of measking GitHub for it, and he\nsent me early access himself.It was awesome.And when I used it, it predicted\nan if statement correctand my mind was just absolutely blownbecause I had nothing before then,and now it's just like first time ever.And I just remember thinking, man,this is going to change\nprogramming so much.And then the more I used\nit, the more I just...For me personally, I\nkept introducing bugs,and I couldn't figure out why.And what I realized is that I developedI wasn't copiloting well, I\nwas autopiloting much better.And my ability to read codeversus my ability to critically\nthink and write code,they're definitely different\nsets of skill levels.I don't consider as well\nwhen I just read codeas opposed to what I write code.And so I struggled there.- I do think that's a skill set.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.\nSkill issue for sure.- Skill issue.For people who are not\naware, that's a hashtag thingsometimes used mockingly in this case.There's several layers\nmockingly, but also seriously,meaning the criticism\nis grounded in the factthat you lack the skillversus some kind of fundamental truth.Yes.\n- Yes.- I think that that's the reasonI use actually Copilot cursor a lotis for developing the skill of editing AIso I can just learn how to\ndo that better and better.Because I think as I do\nthat better and better,I start to utilize AI better.At this time, it is a bit\nof a boilerplate code thing,but you can do out of the\nbox novel design decisionsor tricky design decisions from scratchbut fill out stuff using AIand then just learn\nthe skill of modifying.I personally just...It's more fun to program with AI.Even when I delete a lot\nof the code, it's more fun.It's less lonely.It's what I imagine\npair programming to be.And I've never done it,but it just feels likethat friction that you getwhen you're staring at an\nempty thing is not there.Empty function, empty class,it's just more fun, less lonely.And I do think that a lot of\nthe easier type of coding,it really helps with like\ninteracting with APIs,basic things that I would\nusually have to look upto stack overflow for.It's just really fast at that.As example, just interacting\nwith the YouTube API.The YouTube API documentation\nis not very good.And you can just load it all in thereand ask it to generate a set of functionsthat access the API, all kinds\nof read and write operations,and it figures it all out.Well, you do have to read.You have to read and check everything.And you start to develop\nthe skill of understandingwhere it misinterpreted the task.What is that skill?I don't even know.You have to be empathicabout what the AI, what\nits limitations are.A lot of the times that has\nto do with prompt engineering.You have to at the same time understandwhat the AI is aware of.What did you actually give it as datato be able to generate the code?A lot of times, we don't realizethat we're not giving\nit enough information.- Yeah.\n- So you've to like...Okay, okay, all right.You have to be empathic.Be like, okay, these are\nthe files it's aware of.This is the specifics of\nthe question you asked it.You have to imagine you're an internthat doesn't know anything else.Oftentimes, we want the AI\nto just figure out the thingsthat's left unspoken.But you can't know those things,you have to specify those things.And so you have to actually\nbe much more deliberateand rigorous in the things you\nspecify, is to spell it out.And so I just have this sea of\nprompts that I have saved up,and I'm building these\nlibrary of different templatesfor prompts and it's a mess.And I'm sure there's a lot of developersthat have this similar kind of mess.A lot of it has to do\nlong-term with the toolingthat's going to improve that.One, the systems are going\nto get much more intelligentwhen you don't need the nuance.And two, there's going to be the toolingthat allows you to specify those thingsand load it in correctly\nand give all the contextthat the system needs in order\nto make the good decisions.And maybe the system asks\nyou follow up questions with,\"Here's things you didn't make clear,\"all that kind of stuff.A lot of that has to\ndo with the interface,with the actual design of the tools.Like we said with Cursor,it's going to keep getting\nbetter and better and better.My sense is developers in\ngeneral should be learning thisto not be left behind,to see how that can be\nused as a superpowerto boost their productivity,\ntheir effectiveness,their joy of programmingversus be seen as a competitor to themor something like that.But for me already,it's been a big boost to productivity.If you measure the actualhow quickly you're able\nto get a thing done,it's been a big...And measured not across minutes\nand hours but days also.Sometimes there's things I have to dothat are not that importantthat I'll just out of\nprocrastination will push off.- I know that.\n- And AI helps meactually get it done,because that thing, the empty page,like I mentioned before,it helps me write the thing, get it done,get it tested, ship the thing.Maybe it's just because\nit's just less lonelyto work with an AI.I don't know.I don't know if any of\nthat made sense, but-- It all made perfect sense.I really do like that phrase,\nit makes it less lonely.I think there's something\nto that that's interestinghaving just some level of interactionthat's not just like an LSP autocomplete,having something that's\nactually a little bit morethan just that where it\nactually is thinking throughand you can see a different\nthought and you're like,\"Oh wow, that's a way different approachthan I would've taken.Hey, that's cool. I\nlike these kind things.\"And the thing is that I'm\nnot a AI negative person.I can see why people\nreally, really like it.I used Copilot from when\nNat gave me the accessall the way up until about six months ago.I used it for quite some time.And I really did enjoy the\nthings I used out of it.It did the opposite for me.I felt like I was more\nreviewing than writingand I felt like I was more\njust letting things slidewhere I just didn't really\nthink too heavily about stuff.And just I wasn't as engaged.And so I'm like, \"Okay,\nsomething's kind wrong here.\"And that's just a me personal thing.I recognize that is nothow someone should approach these things.That's not a good reason forwhy you should or should not use AI.I just don't think that that's right.I could probably correct thatand figure out a better way to do it.I've been meaning to\nhave another AI round,and so I've been thinking aboutmaybe I just need to\nspend two weeks in Cursorand just fully embrace what does it meanto be somebody like this?And what can I do with these new powers?Have they improved to the point\nwhere they're actually good?And for me, because a lot\nof the decisions I make,a lot of the little functions\nI'm writing, it's notbecause trying to write this\nfunction to solve this problem,it's because I'm writing\nthese functions or this setnot just to solve this problembut because I know in\nabout another 2,000 linesof code of building\nall these other things,I'm going to need to start\ndoing this next activity.It's like I'm trying to really\ntry to chess move myselfinto the exact things that,\nas I let things go faster,I kind of fall apart on that chess move.And again, skill issues for on my behalf.And I mean it in the\ntruest sense of the wordwhere it's like I'm making a critiquebecause I don't use it well enough.- The better you're at programming...I don't know if this is a general rule,this is my anecdote data.The better you're programming,the less you want to use the\nAI, the more gets in the way.Like the good programmers...- It's fair enough, as far as I can tell.- The more beginner\nprogrammers are much more happyto use AI.When I use AI, it's for basic for just...I don't know if there's a better term.It's not boilerplate, but\nit's pretty easy programming.And that kind of programming\nis much easier to do.The 10X, not to use the meme,programmers that I know\nthat are ultra productiveand brilliant people, they hate AI.They're like, \"This is nowhere\nclose to what's needed.\"There's something to that.I still think they should be\nusing AI just for the learningbecause it's going to get\nsmarter, it's going to get better.It's the same thing,it's like when you super optimize Neovimor super optimize Emacs,you may not discover new things\nthat are in the pipeline,so it's always good to\nbe training in that way.- Let me ask you a question\nhere just for my understanding.You talked about this ideathat you have all these LLM prompts,all this big backlog of messy LLM promptsthat you have these templates forthat you can do various actions.You have these strategies of\nmaking itself explain itselfand then do the right thing.As far as I can tell,that's really built into a lot of people.Well, then you make this\nphrase where you're like,but then at some point, the\ninterface is gonna get better,and maybe it can do a lot\nof these things betterwhere I won't need that.Then my question is,well, is anyone actually falling behindfor not using AI then?Because if the interface is\ngoing to change so greatlythat all of your habits\nneed to fundamentally changeand it will be able to clarifyand make all those statements,have I actually fallen behind at all?Or will the next gen\nactually just be so differentfrom the current one that it's like, yeah,you're over there actually\ndoing punch card AI right now.I'm going to come in at compiler time AI,so different that it's\nlike what's a punch card?- Obviously open question.\nIt's a fascinating one.I personally think, yes,\nyou're falling behind.Not you,but if you're not-\n- It could be me.it could be me.\n- not playing with it,you're falling behindbecause the thing I'm\ndoing with the promptsis you're learning,you're building up this\nintuition about how AI works.You're understanding what is\nits strengths and weaknesses?Not even the current version,but the next version and so on.What does it mean to teach\nan AI system about the world?What kind of information does it needto make effective decisions?I think that does transfer to\nsmarter and smarter models.You'll need to make less rigorousand specific in details\ninstructions over time,but you still have to\nhave that kind of thing.I think it's a skill of almost\nempathy with an AI systembecause it doesn't know...You know what it's missing?\nIt's missing common sense.It's missing long-term memory.A lot of things, when\nwe talk to other humans,they have a basic common\nsense about reality,and AI systems often lack\nthat kind of common sense.And they also don't remember things.You have to realizethere's a constant blank slate happening.It's almost just a skill\nof talking to an AI systemthat I'm training.And by having to write all those promptsand communicating back and forthto understand what kind of\nprompts work better or not,you build up that intuition.And also just raw the skill of\nreading somebody else's code.Maybe for people who work on large teams,that's a skill that's already developed.For me, not so much,so learning how to modify the codethat somebody else\nwritten is a real skill.And also, the other thing you mentioned,which is considering another perspectiveon a piece of code is really nice,but it is also a skill to understand,okay, this is what you did.There's a skill to asking\na question that codethat's been generated such that\nyou can have a conversationabout the approach that was taken.I think there's just a lot of\nsubtle, little skills involvedin a cooperative endeavor to code,kind of like there was a real skill issuebetween you and Teej when\nyou guys did the videoof two idiots, one keyboard.People should go watch that video,where you guys obviously sucked at it.- Yeah, co-using.- That was pretty cool,\nwhich you guys did,which is controlling one Neovim interfacefrom two different keyboards.- Yeah, and then we each get an allowanceof certain characters or\nmotions we could perform.- Yeah. And so you both had\nto communicate together.That's a real skill.I'm sure you can get\nsuper efficient with that,but it just takes time to\nlearn that kind of thing.So yeah, I think there's some value to it,but I think there's a learning curve.- I do want one thing to be pretty clearis that I actually use AI quite a bit.I just don't use it for programming.And so one thing I've been\ntrying to get it to isto be able to have a long interviewor understand what Twitch Chat is sayingand become Twitch chat\nand be able to speakas if it is Twitch chat.Try to learn how to prompt\nit in different ways.And so I think those things\nfor me are just really fun.I tried to get it to learn\nhow to play tower defense.I made a tower defense game in Zigand then made it play tower defense,and then played a Claude\n3.5 against OpenAI.Claude 3.5 would do better\nduring the daytimes,and OpenAI did better\nduring the nighttimes.I don't know why, I have no\nidea what was going on there,but one would just start winningand the other one would start losing.It was just very strange.And so it's just this, I'm\nlearning to prompt well,but I'm learning to prompt\nin a very different axis.I just don't find it very useful yetin programming.\n- In programming.And I should also say that I'm using itin every walk of life, in every context.I use that same kind of exploration\nabout prompts and so on,I'm using and learning.I think it legit is a\nwhole field in itself.- Yeah.\n- Prompt engineeringand how to interact with AI systems,I think it's worth the investment.Can you actually speak to that?Because I saw you're basically pullingfrom Twitch chat and having an LLM speak.I didn't realize, I thought you're,you're not reading the\nexact chat messages.- Yeah.\n- You're doing kind of,some kind of summarization?- Yeah, so I try to go like a....I ended up making like\neight queries off to OpenAIwhere it's just like\nthe first thing is likeI have it have it like\na default personality.\"Hey, you're Randall, the manager,you're a software engineering manager.\"Kind of explain their\nposition, what they like,what they don't like, and then be like,\"These are the list of\nthoughts you have in your headand you need to talk to this personand ask them a question.\"- This is amazing.\n- \"Give me 10of these responses that you\nthink are probably thoughtsthat you have and you want to ask.\"Make it kind of give you a\nlist and then be like, \"Okay.\"Then re-prompt and be\nlike, \"Hey, you're Randall,you're this, this, this, this, this.You have these 10 questions before youand now you need to select one of themand reword it in a way\nthat sounds more like you,the engineering manager.\"And I'm constantly trying\nto make it iterate on itselfas opposed to just one-shotting it.And I found if I iterate too much,it loses what it was\noriginally trying to askif I don't do it enoughand it's just too\ndegenerate from Twitch chat.And so it's like I have\na lot of improvementto do with this idea-\n- Just to clarify,you're feeding in Twitch chat,these are the thoughts.You're a manager,these are the thoughts\nyou have in your head,pick out some of the\nmost profound thoughts?- Effectively. It's like\ndepending on what I want it to do.I'm trying to work on a\nbetter system still for it.- [Lex] Kind of brilliant.- And so it's like, how can\nI give voice to Twitch chat?Can I make it so that I can\ncreate adversarial charactersagainst Twitch chat or for Twitch chat?Can I incorporate YouTube?\nAll that kind of stuff.And how do you describe to an LLMto role-play into its position?And so just thinking through\nthose kinds of things.So maybe I am having some prompt skills,but it's just not in the coding world yet.- Sure.\n- One day I'll get there.- I saw that you were playing\nwith different voices.There was like a sexy voice?- That started off as a French voice-- French voice?\n- and then it turns outElevenLabs just cannot do a French lady.And when you do multilingual French lady,she starts talking.It's like, \"What? What is this?\"- I tuned into one of your streamsand there's this ladyin a sexualized way.- It became too funny.And so we call her Not\nFrench Stormy Daniels.- Oh, nice.\n- Yeah.But I want to go back to the\nAI and some of the aspects.- [Lex] Sure.\n- And so my big gripe with AIhas nothing to do with its capabilities.It's exactly capable,\nas it should be capable,because that's what\npeople programmed it as.The things that I really dislike is,A, there's a whole group of\npeople that are just like,\"The end is nigh.AI is here, you just need\nto stop programming.\"I cannot tell you, even you\nmentioned Pieter Levels earlier,he made some sort of tweetand one of the person's responses was,\"No one in 2025 or whatever\nshould be acquiring hard skills.You should rely on everything\nfor the AI effectively.\"And it's just like these are\nreally damning pieces of advicefor young people.Young people are being toldthat you should never become\nan expert in anything,you should always offload.And the problem is that\nanyone worth any of their saltwill tell you that AI,\nthough can produce code,is going to get it wrong\nin a huge number of cases.And as the code becomes\nbigger or more complexor more input, it's going to just startkind of sloshing back\nand forth between bugs.And so if you don't have those hard skillsand you're not ultimately the\ndriver at the end of the day,you're going to really\nfind some hard times,and your ability to progress\nwill be directly boundto how good the LLMs are.So if you believe that the\nLLMs will be vastly superiorto humans in the next year,\nmaybe that's a good bet.But if they aren't,\nthen your skill ceilingis bound to whatever they are.And even beyond that,there's just a level of\ninformation problem, which is like,Can the thing actually navigate larger...Do we even have enough compute powerto be able to solve\nthings at this real scale?And even if we did, if everybody\nstarted using it right now,\"Do we even have the compute powerfor everybody to use it right now?There's a lot of kind\nof bounding questions,there's privacy concerns,\nand I just don't want peopleto make the immediate,or what appears to be the obvious choice,where you don't need hard skills,you don't need these things.Our life is already gonna be...We just need to only think creatively.It's like, no, I don't think so.I think these hard skills\nare going to be aroundfor quite some timeeven with a massive improvement in the AI,you're going to really be\nneeded to step in regularlyfor quite some time as far as I can tell.- But I also think even on top of that,just even acquiring the hard\nskills or whether that means,programming from scratch, for example,in the context of programming,that's going to make you\nbetter at steering the AI,not just correcting the\nAI, but steering the AI.I think there is some kind of,if you know how a computer works,you can program Python better.It's maybe counterintuitive,but if you know the\nlow level abstractions,some intuition around that,you can steer the high\nlevel abstractions better.- Yeah.\n- But that just seemsto be the case.Unless of course AI becomes\nlike truly super intelligentlike many levels above,but it's very unlikely in the short term.And in the long term it's still goodas it gets better and better and betterto be able to ride the\nwave of the improvement.- Yeah, I'm on that team very much so.- A lot of people have written to me,I think a lot of developers,programmers are really concernedabout the future of their professionin the context of quickly\nimproving AI systems.So do you think AI will\neventually replace programmers?- The hard part about that phrase isyou use the term eventually,meaning do I think in five\nyears, 10 years, a hundred years?What does that term actually mean?I think at some point\nif we are able to scale,if all things continue at the\ncurrent rate of improvement,there does come a point where programmingas a hard skill does become unnecessary.At some eventual point,\nway, way down the road, yes.I don't know what that point looks like.I don't know when it's going to happen.I don't even attempt to\nmake predictions about that.But there are still some leaps\nand bounds we need to make.I mean even just societally,there's plenty of companiesthat don't even allow you to use AI.I mean, there's just\npractical problems that exist.So that's a question I\njust try not to answerin the direct sense.There will come a day\nif humanity continuesand all things continue in\na good positive direction,where a lot of skills\nwill go out the windowdue to immense computing systems.So, yeah, I'll give you that one.But it's just like if I\ndon't think it has anythingin the near term, there's\nbeen no computer improvementup to this date that did\nnot result in more jobs.- Yeah, absolutely.I would say that I think it dependshow you define programming also,because when the communitymoves from assembly to C, from C to,I don't know, Python and JavaScript,that's evolution.That's really painful for a lot of peoplewho are used to programming\nthat lower-level language,so there's going to be\na continuous evolution.And maybe that means with AI,there's going to be\nmore and more evolutiontowards natural language\nas part of the tool chainlike being able to learn\nhow to write proper prompts.Yeah, because natural\nlanguage is still a language.And in the long term, it's possiblethat a large percentage of\nprogramming is natural language.There are probably still going to besome percentage that's not,that's going to be extremely\nstructured language.- Right now, I don't think we areanywhere near natural\nlanguage being possiblebecause it's ambiguous.And I think what we'll end up seeingas people push really hard into this,you're going to see some\nsort of pseudo-lang,which is going to be a language\nfor AIs in which you prompt,which is going to be less ambiguous.People keep striving towards\nthe less ambiguous state.And at that point you're just programmingor just programming yet another evolutioninto a higher order language.And perhaps that is a futurein which people will have\na more terse language.I'm just not sure how much\nmore terse it can get.I mean, all I see is thatif you say natural language\ncan be used in the pipeline,you've just made that many more peoplecan become programmers, which\nmeans that much more softwarewill eventually be created,which means there's\nthat much more softwarethat will need to be maintained,and just becomes a real\nbig snowballing effect.- But there's just people\nwho are programmerswho are worried about their jobs.Not a complete replacement,\nbut maybe a rapid evolutionof what it means to be a programmer.Like you mentioned, if\nnatural language becomes a waythat you can communicate\nor you can program,that means the pool of peoplewho can get programming\njobs changes rapidly,so they're really concerned.- And to some extent,because no matter how much we\nwant to say how good AI is,there comes a point\nwhere there exists a bug,there exists a large piece of softwarein which to describe the changerequires just pages and\npages of descriptionto the point where it is\nsignificantly just faster or easierfor someone to just whip something out.There's definitely a balance there,it's not like a perfect trade-off.And so I think people\nneed to quit worryingand think about how they\ncan integrate it and try,like prove it to themselves.Do they actually make\nthemselves irrelevant?- And if you truly make\nyourself irrelevant,I would challenge you that you're already,you're just doing somethingthat was just slightly too\ncomplicated to automate.If you're only writing\njust straight up crud appsfrom backend to front end\nand simple table displays,yeah, maybe we just couldn't\nquite automate that awayand now we just have somethingthat can just do that a little bit better,so now that's automated away,but that's not really programming.That's almost like building\nLegos at that point,where the designs are already set,you just simply have\nto move piece from baginto correct position.- Yeah.Is there something you recommendhow a developer or programmer\ncould avoid the situationwhere AI can automate them away?- I think that the bigger\nthe project you can manage,the bigger the thing you can\nbuild, the more understandingboth down and up the stack you can go,the more valuable you become.Because if you understand\nhow to build somethingin the front end,okay, well, now you kick off\nsome LLM task of some sort,that's going to go off and\nmake a change to the front end.Okay, while it's doing that,you can go and kick off\nsomething in the CLI tool,you can go and you can go kick\noff something somewhere else.And as these things\ncome back with results,you can review the results,make sure it's the way you want it,change it, commit it, go to the next.You only become more,\nas you said in the end,more productive if we reach this statewhere it's truly able to do that.- I think there is like a skill\nto working together with AI,which is why I'm kind of excitedto watch you keep trying to do it.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- It's like we don't\nknow how it fits exactly,but it feels like AI should\nbe a boost to productivity.And I definitely think it's a boostto just the joy of programming.I think there's a lot of people,yeah, it's a job, but it's\nalso a source of meaning,a source of joy.Programming is fun, you're\ncreating something cool,and also potentially\nthat a lot of people use.- There's this one thing that\njust really frustrates me,and this is kind of going\ninto the Devin category,which is that I want an intern that cares.- [Lex] Yeah.- You don't get that out of\nan LLM. It does not care.Meaning that I don't want\nit just to make a UI for methat displays these icons like\nI asked, I want it to care,I want it to think about it,\nI want it to present to meand me being like, \"Oh\nyeah, yeah, that's great.\"And then me to make changes.\nAnd then later on it's like,\"Actually, I really rethought about thisand actually it'd be way\nbetter if we change...\"It doesn't actually care about the craft.But when you work with an internor you work with somebody else, they care.When they factor something,\nthey actually go over and go,\"Oh yeah, this is actually kind of bad.I'm going to come back to that.\"They finish this, they go back over hereand they make this even better.They actually care about the thing itself.It's a completely different experience.I just want something that also caresthat wants to make the thing better,not just simply accomplish the task.And I know I'm asking way\ntoo much that's not...Now we're getting into\nBlade Runner's level AI.I just want something thatit just feels like I'm missing that,where it's just like it\nwill complete the taskto whatever level it understood\nwhat I was prompting,but it doesn't actually care about it.- I mean, there's so\nmany aspects to caringversus the trivial version of\nthat is a kind of restlessnesswhere you want to keep improving,and I think that is very much AI could do,where it constantly just ask itself,\"Can I make this better?\"And if it keeps doing that,it probably is going to take\nit to some ridiculous place,so actually it's also\nknowing when to stop.I think developing something\nyou can call taste,which is like trying,\nworking extremely hard,constantly improving\nuntil it just feels right.This is it.And I think that is a thing\nthat AI is not good atwhere it's just like, \"Yes, this is it.\"- I've had write iterated\nthree times and three was the-- Yeah, that's it. We're now there.And I think ultimately that\nis what humans are amazing at,which is like knowing\nwhen something is rightlike, \"This is it.\"Especially as you understand,as you develop taste in\na particular industry,in a particular context\napplication, knowing like,This is it. Yeah.The rounded corners on this\nbutton, that's exactly that.That's beautiful.So it's just a sense of\nbeauty, a sense of function,and efficiency, and so on.Yeah, but humans could doalmost like supervision of\nAI systems in that context.- Yeah.- Yeah. You've ranted about\nDevin just full of rage.- I mean, first off,the people that run\nDevin are extremely nice.I want that to be understood.I don't have some sort of upsetnessagainst them or anything like that.Second, Devin, it's like the full packagewhen it comes to programming.So it's going to have, you're\ngoing to give it a taskand a repo, and it's going to go through,it's going to try to understand\nthe repo and the task,make the change to the\nrepo by exploring it,then actually make a commit to GitHuband explain what it did, so\nthat you can have like...So hopefully you have\nthis whole offline thing,which is the other part of this AI partthat I actually really\nlike, where it's just like,\"Go fix this thing.\"Then I can just go and\nunbroke and fix this one thingand come back and go, \"Okay,\ngood enough, merge, boom.\"I want that kind of running,\nbeing able to complete things.I think the ideal solution is thatyou can start giving it small bugsand it goes and fixes these\nbugs and you can just come backto these backlog tickets\nthat no one ever does,and it actually starts going\nthrough these backlog tickets,and it's actually a\nreally amazing experience.So I love the idea.I think we can all agree\nthat that sounds great,but every time I've done it\nand I've asked it for manyand I try to keep narrowing\ndown the problems,the more narrow the\nproblem, the better it does.So if I'm like, just\nadd one singular icon.And when it gets clicked,I want you to do this\njust console, click me.At least create me an SVGand place it so it's nicely placed.The more narrow the task,the more likely it's to be successful.There's like a certain level of specifyingwhere if you specify too much,\nit just like can't do it.If you specify too little,\nit just does weird things.So it's kind of like\nthis very kind of fun,unique way you have to\nplay the balance game.But so far, every time I do these things,I always end up going,\"Gosh, I should just\nget better at Tailwindand write it myself,\"because I always go back\nand I just rewrite it,and then it's just like,\"Dang it. What am I saving at the end?\"I feel like I'm not saving anything yet.And it's just like this,\n\"I want it so bad.\"I actually want AI to be greatbecause then I can really go fast.I mean, I can go amazing fast,\nbut then I always just go,\"Gosh, I should have just\nlearned Tailwind myselfto like the nth degree and just go fast.\"- Yeah, we should also\nmention that debugging,this might be intuitive\nor counterintuitive,AI is really bad at.- Yeah.\n- Like that isone of the hardest...It actually makes you realize\nhow special humans areand how difficult the\ntask of debugging is.Obviously, for trivial debugging,\nmaybe you can find bugs,but that is the real art of programmingis finding bugs, logical bugs,extremely complicated\nrare bugs, edge cases.AI can assist, but man,the hard ones really\nrequire so much context,so much experience, so\nmuch intuition from,again, operating in a\nfog full of uncertainty.It's hard.\n- Yeah.- Of course AI could maybe create logsand do traces and do some kind ofloading a huge amount of\ndata that humans can't,but ultimately that just meansit could be a better\nassistant in debuggingversus the actual lead debugger.- Yeah. I mean, it'd\nbe great if they could.I mean, the more it can\ndo that, the better,because as far as I can tell,correct me where I'm wrong on this,current state debugging is\nreally, it looks at the code,it looks at the bug problem,it just kind of tries to text-predictwhere it's most likely accurate,and then just tries to fix that spot.And so it's like it's likely this spot,you said admin panel, it's\nslightly off, this, this, this.It's probably this location,which could actually be a\nreally great way to do search,let me do semantic searching,\npoint to me where this is,because maybe that is a really great wayto navigate large code bases.It's like smart intelligent search.As opposed to trying to\nmake it do the thing,ask it to just help you do the thingin pinpointing problems.I'd love to see more of that,because that's for me is\nlike the exciting part.And there's this really great articleby creator or maintainer of curl,it's the I in the LLM\nstands for intelligence.And he writes curl and maintains Curl.Curl has been inundated with\nsecurity problems and all this,and it's all from LLMs being like,\"Oh, I found a security flaw.\nHere's the security flaw,\"details it out in the code.And he's just like,\"Okay, how did you\nreproduce that? Show me,\"because if you look at\nthe code right here,that's actually an impossible\nsituation you're speaking of.And it's just like going in these circlesand security right now is being inundated,these bug bounty programs\nare being inundatedby LLM-submitted responsesbecause they can't\nactually analyze the codebeyond just like basic text prediction.\"Oh, this is a stir copy.Stir copy is commonly referred,\nblah, blah, blah, blah.Boom, there you go. Here's the bug.\"And it's just like, \"No,\nthat's actually impossiblebecause the if statement right beforehandleaves the function if\nthe string is too long,so it's like we don't\neven run into this case.It's impossible what you're saying.\"So debugging is very interesting.- Yeah, I mean, that\nfor me would be the big,if it can solve that, not\nsolve that, but improve that,that would be huge, whether it's agentsor just LLMs integrated into IDE.- I think there's this whole idea,I call it a denial of attention.I think there's an entire attack vectorthat's going to be happening.We're using LLMs to\ngenerate fake bug reports,fake all these things to\njust actually effectivelyto demotivateand hurt open source maintainers.Polykill was the first bug that\nkind of had this experience,is this denial of attentionwhere an active malicious\nmaintainer just hounded the owner.And then a white knight came outand offered to buy some\nstuff from under them.And when they bought it,\nthey actually replaced itwith a malicious piece\nof code and then used it.So there's this whole security worldthat's developing around using thesein a very aggressive format.- I mean, it's a fascinating\nworld we're entering into,but I do agree with youthat human developers will\nbe a huge part of that world.- Yeah.- That the job might evolve,\nbut it's going to be there.If I can, I didn't\nreally look at this page,I thought it would be\ncool to go over with you.This is, again, the-- Stack overflow, my favorite.- Stack Overflow Developer Survey,talking about their sentiment\nand usage of AI systems.The general sentiment of, yes,61% say yes, they use itand 25% say no, don't plan to.So majority use it,majority have a favorable\nsentiment over it,favorable or very\nfavorable or indifferent.That's like looks like over 90%.- That's really surprising thatthat many people just have\nno plan in looking into AI.As much as I don't like\nusing it for coding,I hope one day I can use it more.And so it's like, to me,I'm always looking for the next thing.I'm just surprised that people are, that,I guess obstinate for it.Obviously, the second one,\nthe AI tool sentiment,it must be only the users who respondedto the top two of that first onejust given the amount of respondents.- [Lex] I wonder if no and\ndon't plan to are peoplewho have tried it and quickly\nbuilt up the intuition like,\"This really sucks.\"- Yeah.\n- So it could belike experienced programmers.They're like, \"No, this is not\nmaking me more productive.\"81% agree that increasing productivityis the biggest benefit that\nthe developers identifyfor AI tools.Okay, so this is, what are the benefits?Increased productivity, speed up learning,greater efficiency,\nimprove accuracy in coding,make workload more manageable,\nimprove collaborate.Where's the fun, increased fun?I would say that's like number one for me.- Maybe speed up learning is\nlike a subcategory of fun.If you're able to learn more\nand be able to become better.To me, that sounds good.- [Lex] I don't know.It's different because\nproductivity is part of fun too.There is just a lightness.I mean, maybe improved collaboration,all of these elements for sure.- My time using Copilot,there was certainly a level of wonderthat would happen for quite some timewhere it's just like, it's\njust amazing what it can do.- Yeah.\n- I'm just super impressedby what it can do, even\nthough I don't use it.It's amazing to me that we have somethingthat can even get that close.- [Lex] In terms of accuracy of AI tools,only 2.7% highly trust.- [ThePrimeagen] I would say\nthat you have to be very greento think that you should\nhighly trust an AI output.You should be very skeptical.- [Lex] Yeah, I don't know where I stand.Probably somewhat distrust.Highly distrust seems aggressive.- It does seem a little, true.You definitely be in the somewhat like...You should always assume\nthat there's something wrong,and then from there you\ncan go and challenge it.- [Lex] And then estimationof whether AI can handle complex tasks,most people don't think it\ncan handle complex tasks.I mean, it seems like\npeople have a good senseof what it's able to handle and not.- I would argue that people\ndon't have a good graspof what complex is in programming.- [Lex] Sure, yeah.- If you say, \"Write me quicksort,\"some people will think\nquicksort's super complex.But I would argue that that's actuallyprobably the simplest thing\nyou could ask an AI to do.Things that are so well documented,it's going to do a great job at that.- Yeah, probably high-level\ndesign decisions,which people don't even\nuse AI for right now,I guess agents are supposed to\nbe doing that kind of stuff.That's probably the most difficult thingor the most impactful thing,or the most difficult\nthing is finding bugs.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- [Lex] AI tools next year,\nwriting code, and so on.- [ThePrimeagen] Now,\nthis one, the ethics part.I'm actually super curious\nyour take on the ethics.Will we see Europe laying\ndown some new regulations?- [Lex] Oh, boy.- [ThePrimeagen] What about artists?What about people that are really...Because the difference\nbetween coding and artistsis very, very simple.If you gave me a sheet of\npaper, I could draw you a crab.You go, \"That's a crab.\"But you can't do that with coding.It's like it's right or it's wrong.There's not a variation of interpretationfor what a crab is.It's like, \"No, you cannot\nmake that statement.\"It's very bounded in what it can express.And I could see why artists,that's a very frustrating point.And then who gets rewarded for all that?And then there's like the whole thingwith coding and licenses.How much of it is GPL\nlicenses, do you think,they've scraped and used as training data?GPL forces open source.What are you going to do with that one?That means your model might\nneed to be open source.OpenAI may have to get forced open,all their previous stuffif there's any hint of GPL.- Yeah, that's a weird one.That's a really weird onebecause most of these models\nI think are training on datathey don't technically have\nrights to be training on.- Yeah, there's a lot of questions.- There's an unspoken,\nit's a real Wild West.- Because you could imagine\nthat, I always use Europebecause they tend to have likemaybe the most consumer\nprotection laws out there.You could imagine what happens\nif a law came down that saidthat if you used a model that\nproduced GPL potential code,you have to open source?How many companies are going\nto be like, \"Oh my gosh\"?Like, \"You have one year\nto get rid of all codethat was generated that's\npotentially GPL-sourcedfrom a model.\"You could imagine just the sheer panicthat's going to happen.It'd be a fire sale of code.- So given all that,can you give advice to young programmers?This is another question from Reddit,the infinite wisdom of Reddit.\"What should a person\nin their early 20s doto move forward in the tech industry?\"And this is an interesting\naddition to the question,\"And by doing it,will this be walking on\nsomeone else's path?\"- I am going to try to\nanswer that question,I guess the best I can,which I think that if you're\nentering into the tech world,one of the hardest pieces of advicethat I took a long time to learn wasI became enamored and addicted.Obviously, we talked about that I programfor way too many hours,forgetting to spend the\ntime I needed with my wife,with my friends, all that stuff,like totally wrapping\nmyself up into one activity.I think though it made me who I am,it was probably an unhealthy activityand probably not a wise activity.And so the best advice I can give is thatyou got to develop the love,\nthe skill, the desire for it.Whether that's just only using AI agents,programming yourself, using\nZig or programming JavaScript,whatever that flavor isthat's going to get you\ncoming back every single day,getting the reps in the gym,\nif you will for programming.But also knowing how to\nvalue what is valuableand not getting lost in the\nsauce where you're just so stuckon trying to make the\nnext greatest startupthat you sacrifice your health,you sacrifice your relationships.Or even worse, you\nsacrifice your own moralsto take certain shortcutsthat you probably shouldn't be takingin life to be able to\nachieve these things,because I'm sure there's\nhundreds of horror storiesyou could hear where peopledefinitely shortcutted their\nmorals for monetary success.- Yeah, I mean, the\ngolden handcuffs comfortcan destroy the soul in some sense.Yeah, so that's really\nimportant to remember.There's young people kind of thinking,\"Do I even want to be a programmer now?\"It seems like AI is\ngetting better and betterat programming.If they were trying to make that decision,would you still say,\"Yeah, if this is something\nthat fills you with joy\"?- I still want my kids\nto learn how to programif I can answer that, if\nthat's a good enough answer.- Yeah, that's a really\n- In the sense that- Powerful answer.\n- my kids aredecade younger than a young\nperson trying to learnhow to program right now.And so if I want...I'm hoping that my kid can run and buildwhatever he wants in Roblox.I'm showing him ChatGPT and be like,\"All right, let's ask\nquestions. How do we do this?\"It's still extremely confusing for himto do all these things.And so it's like, \"Let's do this.\"I want him to learn and be effective,and maybe one day he has to throw awayall those skills in 20 years.But I bet you that whatever\nskills he threw awayor whatever hard skills\nhe had to throw away,an entirely new field that\nnone of us have thought about,just like if you would have\nasked somebody in the '70sabout social networks, they'd be like,\"What the heck are you\neven talking about?\"Things will exist in the futurethat are going to be massively different,and crazy, and exciting.- Maybe in virtual reality.- [ThePrimeagen] There you go.- Maybe all of us actually down the linewill just be building video games.- Just entertainment for all,the brave new world of our world?- Well, I think entertainmentis a kind of trivialized versionof what a video game could be.It's like, what is the\npurpose of life anyway?I mean, it could be a deeply\nfulfilling video game.It doesn't have to be\njust like dopamine rush.It could be educational,it could be scary, it\ncould be challenging,forcing an evolution,the leap into adventurethat it makes up a fulfilling life.That could be video games. Who knows?Especially in virtual reality.I tend to...That's the other thing. I\nplay a lot of video games.I think there's a lot of roomto make video games deeply fulfilling,like there's a lot of\nspace where that can go.- I didn't know you played\na lot of video games,because when I asked you specifically,\"Should I play World of\nWarcraft or do Advent of Code,\"you're like, \"Advent of\nCode, Advent of Code.\"- Oh, well, that might meanI've never played World of Warcraftbecause there's certain games I avoid.Fortnite, by the way,\nI think was one of thembecause I was worried\nit'd become too addicted.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah, yeah.- So there's certain games I just knowI won't get super addicted to.Like for example, I'm\nterrified of Civilization.I have never played a Civ's\ngame because I'm worried.I'm worried the dark path in my leadbecause there's some games\njust really pull you in.I'm much better with,\nthat's why I play Skyrim.I can play these games or a Baldur's Gate,and moderate how much I play.And they could be like\na lifelong companionversus an addiction\nwhere it's like sunriseand you're like, \"What's\nhappening with my life?\"And I find myself naked\nbehind a dumpster somewherejust wondering what happened.Yeah, so that's how I\nchoose my video games.- You're not the first personwho has specifically\ncalled out Civilization.- Yeah.\n- I've had morethan one person, also very\nhigh up in the tech world,be like, \"Civilization is my downfall.If I get near that game, I'm done.\"- [Lex] Yeah. So.- I've never even played the game.Now it makes me be like,\"Dude, I got to give this\na try. That sounds crazy.\"- Yeah, and the new oneis actually supposed to\nbe really, really good.What were we talking about? Yes.For that same young developer,is there a trajectory through jobsthat you could give advice on?So you started out with Schedulicity?- Yeah, that was my first full-time...When I had the government\ncontracting one before,that wasn't quite full-time.It was in C. It was a lot of fun.And then building my own\nstartup for quite some time.So if you count either\nof those as full-time,then those would be the full-time.Schedulicity was the official on the docs.- Is there some value to jumping around,working in one companyand another to try to figure\nout what brings you joy?- I think there's a lot to thatbecause not every job you're\ngonna get is gonna be great.Now, your first job you could getcould make you think you hate programming.It happened, I did an\ninternship at a placeand I keep on surprising youwith more kind of things\nI did in the past,did an internship at-- Fuck. You did so many things.It's incredible.- At a place called Total\nInformation Management System.Remember when I talked\nabout that hours ago,about healthcare and thatand industrial shipping and all that?It was a C-sharp shop.It was so bad that after I did that,I went and changed my majorto mechanical engineering\nfirst semester in college.- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.\n- I thought I,\"Okay. Actually I like computer science.I hate the programming.\"So just because you've had a jobdoesn't mean it's going to be the one.And the thing is, here's\nthe best part though,if you get a job and you like itand you want to do it and it's exciting,you don't need to change.I think a lot of people are like,\"Oh, I got to find the next thing.I've been here for two years.\"There's of this, you got\nto move around mindset.I don't think you have to move around.I don't think it hurts your career.Because if anything, you'll\ngain more responsibilityand you'll be able to talk\nwith way more authority.And the next time you interview,you're going to be way more into like,\"Oh yeah, I had to get these\nX people and these X peopleto be able to do all this stuff.\"And it's like you can talk\nwith much more authorityif you stay at a place longer.And that's nothing but\nbenefits in my book.It's only if you stay at a\nplace because you're afraidor you don't want to...You already have something\nthat works for youand you just never want to\nchange and you're just like,\"I get to go in and just\nbe completely mindless.\"I think if you go mindless\nfor a couple years,you'll find yourself...That's the only real danger.You just come out with nothing at all.- Especially when you're\nyounger, that's the whole point.\"Take the risk.Take the leap out to the next\nthing, to the next thing.\"And not for money, but for\njust personal joy, joy.- And money could get at the\nend, that's the best part.When you don't strive for the money,sometimes the money just shows up anyways.- Yeah.And some of the, what\nmakes life worth livingis the people you work with, a good team.Some of it's not to be\ngeneric, but culture matters.It's whatever makes you happy.For example, I just had\nwon't call out places,but there's certain companieswhere everybody is very nine to five.And even if the work is exciting,they don't work hard enough I would say.I'm one of those people\nthat likes to go all out,likes to be surrounded by\npeople who are super passionate.Now to be fair, a lot of them\ndon't have families or don't-- Yeah.- It's a fascinating choice.I really don't want to\ntalk down on any choicelike work-life balance or not,I think both are beautiful paths.And if you really derive a lot of valuefrom joy from your work,going all in, at least for\nsome stretch of your lifeis a beautiful thing to do.Just all out,full-on passion, sacrifice\na lot of social life,all that kind of stuff.I don't know. That\ncould also be beautiful.- There could be something\nvery, very exciting about thatin some sense, especially if\nyou're building your own thing.I could imagine that\nwould be very exciting.If I was Amazon, Jeff\nBezos building Amazon,one could imagine that those early yearswere probably very rough\nand the amount of hourshe probably put in were very, very rough.But I will say that\nthere's this unique aspectin our culture where we make\nthis as an equal trade-offbetween family or work,like \"Oh, you do or you\ndon't have to have kids.\"And my only real notion\nwith that one is thatyou will never know your capacity for loveuntil you have kids.You just don't know.And some people are like,\n\"Oh yeah, but I love my dog.\"It's just like I loved my dogs too.And then I had kids and now my dogs are,\"They're all right. I like them.\"- I get it.\n- I could come homeand I pet Indy and I'm like, \"Oh, Indy.\"And then I'm just like, \"Okay, bye Indy.\"I can't even describe the\ndifference between the two,it's not even the same.And so that trade-off making\nis no one can tell youwhat it's like because\nthere's a real realitythat's right now, and I'm\nsure, I'm 100% positivethis is with my wife as well,where if right now we got news that saidyou have some medical\nprocedure where if we do this,you will die, but your kid will live,there's not a question in my\nsoul that I wouldn't do that.If I could look into the futureand if I had to die right nowknowing that my kids\nwould've a better life,they would be happier,\nthey'd be more fulfilledand all those things, I guarantee youeither my wife or I would\ntake that every single time.It's just like you'll never be ableto say that about most things.People will jokingly say thatuntil it's actually on the line.But it's like with that, you\njust have this ferociousness.I can break out and sweat thinkingabout somebody fictionally\npushing my kid to the ground,actually get real adrenal\nresponses flowing through my body.So it's just such a different worldand it's hard to explain.And you could never have convinced mewhen I was young that it'd be this big.- [Lex] Yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah. I thought I knew.I didn't know.- But to add on top of that,some of the most successful people I know,some of the most productive\npeople I know have kids.So I don't know if it's even a trade-off.That love you feel, it seems\nto be a catalyst for liketo make sure you have less time,but you're going to use that\ntime better to be productive.- I would argue that it definitely\nchanged a lot of my lifeand how I approach\nproblems and everything,in a very different way.- Let me ask some random\nquestions from Reddit.On a scale of one to 10, how\nmuch do you hate every productMicrosoft has ever created\nand why is it a 10?I think we covered that.- We haven't technically covered it.- There you go. All\nright, go ahead, go ahead.- Okay, the only thingI'll say is that\n- Use your time.- I don't like that Microsoft\npretends to be the good guywhen what they really\nwanted to get you addictedto their products, to get\nyou to use their productsas much as possible so they can extractas much money out of you.- Well, in this world, are\nthere really good guys?- That's a great point. I would\nargue Neovim is a great guy.There's no way they can make money.Justin Keyes is the benevolent dictatorand he thinks deeply about the productand tries to make it the best as possible.Whereas something like Microsoft,they made VS Code as a loss leader.Copilot's probably\noperating on a loss leader.These things are all\ngetting you so tied into,GitHub, remote workspaces, CI, Copilot,you become this trapped\nin permanent personand if that price rises,the switching cost is\nso great at some pointthat you'll never be able to switch.That's my only fear is that\nMicrosoft was once accusedof EEE and it feels like\nthey're EEEing again.- Yeah, I'm nervous about\ncriticizing a good thingbecause you could see an\nincentive to do that good thing,like Google creating all these servicesthat don't make money\nlike Gmail for example,you can cynically saythey're only doing that to\ntie you into an ecosystemso they can basically keep you for life.But also it's awesome\nthat they created Gmail.- Yeah.- And they created an\nincredible product, so...- I can side with you on that one.It is a good product. VS\nCode is a good product.- Yeah.\n- Now, I think,don't put that on the...But it is fine. They did a great job.- Yeah, so there is going\nto be financial incentivesbehind some of these companies.And by the way, me\ndefending, not defending,but saying positive things about Microsoftis just so I could talk shit to Prime.But that's...- I love that by the way.- Yeah, Linux is my first and\nlast love, it definitely...The spirit of Linux and open\nsource is a beautiful thingso I do think that when you\nhave these large corporations,even when they try to do good,oftentimes the profit imperativejust takes over and they\ncan corrupt themselvesand Microsoft has a long historyof doing just that to themselves.- Yeah.\n- That said, they've done,they have you could say for cynical reasonbecause they want to\nseem like the good guyamongst developers, but they've done a lotto support open source.It's just like, same with Meta,\nMeta has done insane amount-- Yeah.\n- to support open source.You can say, actually for that one,I don't know if I can\neven make a financialor a cynical case for why Metais open sourcing Llama and these-- Yeah, that one's confusing.\nIt just seems great.- Maybe for hiring.But no, I think that's legit,just an ethical, really powerful decision.And sometimes these companies,because they have a lot of cash,can make the right, do the right thing.- Yeah. It's a really\npositive way to look at it.And I think that's really nice.- Well, we should always be skeptical.- Yeah, I mean because at the\nend of the day, companies,they're not good, they're not\nbad, they're morally neutral.It's the people that are running them,the decisions those people\nmake that are reallywhere the bad or the good comes from.- Another question, ask him\nif he knows how to milk a cow?I've already asked that.The answer is-\n- No.- Oh, no, you don't know.- I've never milked a cow.- Never milked a cow.- Almost been killed by a\ncow, but never milked a cow.- Did you ever ride a bull?- No.\n- All right. Why male models?- Okay, so I can explain that one.I will say something like,\"I really dislike the color purplebecause the color purple makes me upset.\"I don't know, just something very benign.But then someone right\nafterwards will be like,\"But why don't you like the color purple?\"And it'll just be like...It's just like Derek Zoolander.It's just like I get done on\na five-minute talk about itand then the next question's like,\"But seriously why though?\"It was just like, \"Why male models?\"- Yeah, so that's the Zoolander referencewhen there's a long explanationwhy male models and he\nagrees and then forgets.- Yep.- What is Ligma?- I've died by Ligma quite a few times.So do you know the origin story of Ligma?- [Lex] No.- So Ninja, famous streamer,\nsomeone got him with Ligmaand said like, \"Oh,\" something like,\"Have you heard about Ligma?\"And he was like, \"No.\" And\nhe's like, \"Oh, Ligma balls.\"And then after that Ninja got so hurtby getting had by that,he started banning anyone in\nchat who's said the word Ligmaor something like that.And so then if you don't embrace\nthe meme you get destroyed.So of course, gets destroyedand so then the whole goal is that,can people get me with Ligma?TJ did iladies.He's like, \"Oh, did you hear that E-girlsgot renamed to iladies?\"And I just didn't even see it coming.And I was just like, \"What?\"And he's like, \"iladies\nnuts on your face.\"And then it's just like, \"Oh my gosh.\"And then a pirate software\nhas also got me like,\"Oh, have you heard about Google SIMA,\"which SEMA is a real product by Google>And I'm like, \"Oh yeah,\nI've heard about this.What is this again?\" He's\nlike, \"SIMA balls,\" right?It's just like, \"Dang\nit,\" how do I keep...?So I've just had it happen live\non stream many, many times.I've died by Ligma the most.- Please ask him about\nthe size of his dict.- Okay, so that's D-I-C-T,\nthat's dictionary in Python.- Who doesn't love dicts?- Yeah, that's a great question.Just a dicts party when you use Python.- I love dicts.- That should be a T-shirt.That's actually a hilarious T-shirt.So on Stack Overflow, you can\nask any question you want,and I decided to craft a question\none day on Stack Overflowthat says how to measure\nyour dict in bytes.And then I proceeded to really go to townand explain all the different things like,\"Well, what about the cost of the stringsand the references?\"And when you really get\nboth hands on your dictand really go after it, it's very hard to,really threw in some innuendos.The Stack Overflow team\ndeleted the question,and then someone hand wrote\nme an email explainingwhy they deleted the\nquestion and complimented meon how thoroughly and\nthoughtful the question wasjust to weave in innuendosand that the entire team was impressed,but it's inappropriate\nand it had to be deletedand don't do it again or we're\ngoing to ban your account.And so it was a very funny\nmoment and so I was like,\"Oh, that's funny that happened.\"That was about six years ago.Last year I was at a conferenceand there's a guy wearing\na Stack Overflow name tagand I was like, \"Oh, you\nwork at Stack Overflow?\"He's like, \"Oh, yeah, I do.\"I'm like, \"Do I got a story\nfor you.\" And he goes,- Oh, no.\n- \"No, wait a second.Are you the dict guy?\"- Yeah.\n- That was hisonly question was that.And I was just like, \"Let's go.\"I didn't even say anything about meand he already knew\nimmediately I was the dict guy.- I should say in all seriousness,I think I've had a bunch of conversationsin the Python world where\nI would have to mentionthe name of this data structureand it makes me uncomfortable every time.- It's a very unfortunate\nshortening of a word.- Dict.It's just like when I\ngo to the hardware storeand ask for caulkand there's always a nice old ladyand I ask her where to find,\nand it's very uncomfortable.I try to pronounce it as hard as I can.- Really get that L in there, like caulk.- Caulk, just to be clear.And try to avoid eye\ncontact the whole time.You said that God was a big part,was a big part of your life.Can you speak to that a little bit more?Who is God and what effect,what role did he play in your life?- So I did talk about that\none important evening where I,for whatever reason, gained\nmy conscious that moment.So obviously for me that\nI grew up with a lifewhere I would probably argue\nmyself as a functional atheist.I went to church a handful of times.I can't quite really remember\nactually going to churchas a family in any sort of sense.So there wasn't some super strong tieor anything like that to it.Pretty much anyone else growing\nup in America in the '90s,you had some sort of\nimpact or intersectionwith church at some point in your life,that was just a very normal\nthing I would probably say.And so when that happened,it was a fairly big surprise for me.I wasn't necessarily going that directionor deciding to do any of those things.And so for me, it's\nobviously the turning pointof my entire life.I cannot speak to who I\nwould be now without that.I can just tell you that I\nwouldn't have had the drive.I probably would not\nhave completed college.I would've not have found\nmy wife or had my kids.I wouldn't know how to value people.I don't think without that whole thing,my value for people would've\nbeen very, very smallbecause I would've continued\nto just objectifyingin the way I was.And then probably the biggest thing isthere's this one verse, I\ndon't even know where it's at,it effectively says that we\nlove because he first loved us.And so for me it's likeI don't think I would've ever lived a lifethat was happy without this.And I just didn't even know\nthat that was an option for me.And I never really,it was a very tough set of years for meand I was very, very sadand just always just constantly\nlooking for somethingto fulfill me.And so it's like I didn't\nhave any confidence,I didn't have any joy.I felt very sad.And so that was this moment wherefor the first time ever\ndidn't, all of a suddenI just felt like I didn't\nhave to live up to a standard.The standards have already been paid for,everything's already,\nthat's the free gift,that's the exchange.And so it's just like for the first time,I didn't have to be the cool guy,I didn't have to have all the right words,I didn't have to feel, I didn't\nhave to go on the conquest,the sexual conquest to find validation.I didn't have to do any of those thingsand it was exceptionally liberating.And so who is God?That's more of a catechism\nquestion perhaps.What is man, who is God?Those are much harder questions.I believe that anytime\nyou try to get too deepinto describing who God is,you typically fall into Christian heresy.- But for you, he gave\nyou a chance to be happy.- Yeah, he gave me a chance\nnot just to be happy,but also made it so that the first timeI can actually feel forgiven\nI guess in some sense,and able to forgive people that hurt me.For a long time I had this\nweight I'd carry aroundfrom the things I hated about high schooland all that kind of stuff.And through that experience,I just wrote down every last person's nameand actually held them\nwith me for quite some timeand this was the list of people I forgave.And I read it a few times.I couldn't let myself be angry or consumedby that kind of stuff\nbecause hate is so sticky,it sticks for a lifetime.And there really is\nonly one cure for hate,which is forgiveness.I just don't think you can\nget rid of it without that.And so I just had choose\nto forgive these peopleand to move on, and it\nreally kind of freed me.And I would never have\nthought forgiveness as a meansfor that change if I didn't\nfirst experience it myself.- What's the role of love\nin the human condition,to go to the philosophical,and what's been the role\nof love in your life?- It's very obviousthat every person wants or desires love.My wife has recently convinced meto watch Love is Blind with her one time.And you watch the show and if\nyou're not familiar with it,it feels like just a\ndisaster of an experimentto just cause crazy filming.But anyways, the idea is thatif you just don't see somebody,you can fall in love with somebodyand want to marry them after 10 daysor some very small period of time.And what you really end up\nseeing is all these peoplewho are just desperate for actually love.And there's some part of it...I told my wife, \"It's\nlike love gladiators.\"We're watching people\nbattle it out for dramaand really what they want is love.And it's like they're fighting\nto the death and love,if you will.And it's this almost kind\nof sad aspect to watch.And so I think that it's hard to call,what is its role in the human experience,because I think it's just somethingthat we all naturally\nnot just want, but need.And I don't think that\nyou can really progress,and when I say the word love,I would like to kind of narrow\nit down maybe a bit more.And I don't mean Eros, the\nGreek word like sexy love,I think that paternal and friendship loveare extremely important.And I think agape, God love\nis also very important.Agape love is the one that\nis superior to them all,but obviously different and also co-neededwith the parental ones and all that.And so you kind of need\nthis mixture of them all,and each one is different for each reasonand where it's applied.And so I don't think...I just don't see a world in which is goodof any kind without that as\na very foundational piece.Because again, I didn't come heretrying to quote any sort\nof scripture, but it saysthat it's not the nails that\nhung on there, it's love.That's the reason why these things happen.And so if forgiveness is the requirementto kind of pay off hate in some sense,then love has to be the\nmotivation for forgiveness.- Yeah, that's the tragic aspect of life.I think there's a deep lonelinessin all of us and a longingto be a part of this bigger thing.And that longing is a love and\nit has many names, but yeah.Yeah, the love aspect of it,it's the beautiful aspect of life,the tragedies, the loneliness,and the unfortunate sufferingthat is a fundamental part of lifeand the beautiful aspect is the love.- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.- Which I think is a good\ntime to mention more Reddit,the place for everlasting\npositivity and love.Somebody wrote, \"Please thank him, you,for his everlasting positivityand give him a big hug for me.\"So I won't give you a big hug on camerabecause I'm afraid I'll get a bonerand that'll be very unfortunate.- Hey, let's not bring\ndicts into this again, okay?- It's my favorite data structure.Like I said, I love dicts,all kinds of dicts, ordered dicts-- Unordered.- Unordered dicts. I don't discriminate.Yeah.But just that to say\nbig thank you from me.I listen to you a lot and\nI just really enjoy...I've been going through\na lot of shit myselfand just the positivity,even when you're building\nthe stupidest shit,it's just the positivity radiates from youand you inspire me to be a good person.You inspire me to build\nstuff. So thank you.And I'm sure there's many, many otherswho listen to you for the same reason.So thank you for your positivity.Thank you for being the\nlight in many people's lives,and thank you for talking to me, brother.- Dang. That was very, very kind.I really do appreciate all thoseextremely nice words even from Reddit.That's very surprising. But thank you.I mean, I know you knowthat there's many people's lives,and I'm sure you've received the lettersthat have been changed from\nactions and things you've saidand things you've done.And so it's one of the best partsabout doing this side is thatyou get a chance to potentially\nimprove somebody's life.And you getting to\ninterview a lot of people,there's a lot of people that\nlistened to Chris Latnerand saw his excitement for Swiftand probably went and learned Swiftand then got really amazing jobsand it can be all origined\nback to back to youand that interview, and so\nthose are amazing things.And so same goes back to you,you've done a lot of good stuff.- Right back at you brother.\nThank you for talking today.Thanks for listening to this conversationwith Michael Paulson, aka ThePrimeagen.To support this podcast,please check out our\nsponsors in the description.And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Paulo Coelho.\"When we strive to become\nbetter than we are,everything around us becomes better too.\"Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time.",
    "summary": "The Lex Fridman Podcast episode featuring ThePrimeagen covers a wide range of topics, from the joys and pains of programming to addiction, faith, and personal growth. ThePrimeagen shares his early experiences with programming, recalling the \"magic\" of linked lists and the struggles of recursion, and contrasts that to the pain of monotonous, unchallenging work. He identifies as a tools engineer with a generalist skillset, capable of tackling UI, library, and build system challenges, highlighting his time at Netflix building tools for developers. The discussion delves into his life story, marked by early exposure to pornography and drugs, the loss of his father, a suicide attempt, and eventual finding of faith, which led to a transformation and a newfound purpose.\n\nThe conversation explores the challenges of overcoming addiction, particularly pornography, and its impact on relationships and objectification of others. The importance of self-improvement, the balance between work and life, and the need for both hard work and smart strategies in programming are emphasized, while also criticizing the pressure towards unneeded technology hype. He shares insights about programming language choices, praising JavaScript for accessibility but stressing the importance of a statically typed language for understanding types, and elaborates on his preference for Neovim, advocating for mastering one's tools. The duo discusses the future of AI and its impact on programming, the importance of good human connection and purpose, and that the best code might emerge from those working towards something they truly find joy in building.\n\nThe podcast culminates in a discussion about maintaining focus and the importance of having a good team around you. They touch upon the ethics surrounding AI-generated code and its implications for the future of the programming profession. The conversation ends on a positive note, reflecting on the importance of human connection and the desire to improve the world, as a key driver for choosing coding, or any professional path."

    "transcript": "so I want to take a little bit of timeand tell you kind of my story I knowthat there's a lot of Engineers outthere a lot of people going intoengineering right now for computers foryou know computer science making sweetscience to computers and you know you'redoing react you're doing JavaScript youyou feel defeated you're like well maybeI'm not smart enough maybe I'm not goodenough if only I would have startedearlier right you know the excuses youknow the things that kind of fill you upand so I wanted to take a moment andgive you my story now I think the mostimportant part of my story is when I wasfour years old I saw porn for the firsttime and from every day up pretty muchuntil this day of my life now I havethought about porn it's just beensomething that's been with me my entirelife from that moment and has reallyrobbed me of a lot of things in my lifeafter that the next most important thingthat you just kind of have to know is mydad died when I was seven so I didn'thave a lot of you know I didn't have alot of Parental figure in my life for alot of my years my mom did the best shecould but she had three kids and she wasworking like 80 hours a week she is asaint a boss she's amazing I absolutelylove my mom and I have zero problemswith how she raised me but the realityis is that most of the time I wasRaising myself which means I neverlearned how to like take things reallyseriously so that's why by the time Igraduated high school I graduated withthe 2.16 okay I was not top of this youknow student chart I was pretty muchdead in the middle and one of theteachers I had told me I was the worststudent she's ever had so you knowwasn't the best but at the end of highschool is where everything reallystarted to go downhill now I had agirlfriend during that time and it waskind of like a longer relationship andultimately it didn't work out surprisesurprise and I just felt like I put allmy identity and worth into it and so ofcourse I tried to commit suicide duringthat time and I just felt this huge deephole inside of me which ultimately ledto me just stopping all forms of carefor my life and so from there on out Ijust did as much drugs I could of coursethe whole porn thing was every singleday I was very addicted to that I justdidn't realize I was addicted to thatand then of course it went from smokingpot mushrooms LSD cocaine all the way upto methamphetamines did meth quite a fewtimes but for whatever reason I just hadthis desire or this I I don't know whatit was this calling Destiny telling me Ihad to go to college and so mygrandfather CU my dad dying when I wasseven said he would pay for my collegeand lo and behold Montana StateUniversity accepted being to go tocollege so I went and of course I alwayswas really fast at typing I lovedplaying video games so I figuredcomputers I could make video games rightdon't we all think that at some pointand when I go to school I did nothingbut party I drank I smoked more coca toomuch LSD to the point where I hadproblems with my vision for years and ofcourse that led to me dropping out andbeing done with school but I still hadall this unhappiness and like this delike I don't know how to say it otherthan like just despair in my life stillat this point and so I did go back toschool in the spring and I actuallyended up completing that but during thattime I just had this extremely realencounter with God to the point where Icould see myself standing on a forkeffectively where it's like on one sideI keep going down the path I'm going andit's just like there's more of what Ialready have I'm unhappy I just hate mylife or I can try something differentand I really did try this somethingdifferent I said okay I'm going to I Idon't know what this means I guess I'mfollowing God now and after that pointnothing changed I was still just asaddicted to porn I still just did drugsI even in fact I did LSD after I didthat but something happened in my heartit's where every time I did anything Ifelt like a conscious right it's likethe thing that wasn't there for allthese years woke up inside of me and allof a sudden I just knew I was not madeto do that and so this led me down acompletely different path I actuallypassed School sure it was like C's andB's but I still passed it it was thefirst time I ever really passed anythingand of course you know we go through thesummer I go the next year and I kind offall back in line with my old friendsand so I intentionally drop out at thatpoint I just say you know what I cannotdo college I'm going to go down thewrong road here at that point I wasstill really struggling with pornographythat was by far the hardest stillsmoking cigarettes really finding thatdifficult to stop uh the drugs part itwas easier as more just like avoid thepeople but cigarettes and porn were veryvery hard because you don't have you youcan avoid people and still do those soof course in the springtime I went tojust like a local school I just I feltso defeated I felt like I had no ideawhat I was doing I thought I might joinSeminary at that point I I didn't evenknow what I was doing I was just like Idon't even know who I am I am anymore soI do a little local programming classsome some math some just some core stuffto get out of the way hated it hated itand then I went to summer school but Iwent up back to Montana State Universityand something happened during this timeI did calculus one you wouldn't knowthis from the story I've been telling sofar but I failed pre-calculus twice andbarely passed the third time so Cal oneI'm like there's no way I'm probably notthat smart to be able to do these thingsand so every single day after 3 hours ofCalculus class which was 5 days a weekI'd go to the math learning center whichwas available 4 days a week and beingthere for 1 to three hours with thetutors and by the third week I wascrusing I was covered from head to toein coconut oil I was the number oneperson in the class something clickedinside of me and what it really was wasthe realization yeah smarts will get youfar but hard work will get you furtherany day of the week and I was justmurdering it by the end we had a finaland it was a 2-hour long test I did itin less than 30 minutes and was thehighest grade in the class it's justlike something happened I was changedand I started to love school I startedto build this passion for learning forwanting to pursue excellence and it justkept happening every class I took I keptbeing one of the best or the best at itevery single time but still during allof this I was struggling with porn andcigarettes and it's just like I couldn'tbreak these addictions and it was justeating me up on the inside I hated itthen after probably my 5,000th timequitting pornography for whatever reasonit just clicked it stayed it was youknow my my head and my heart finallymade a connection and it just left mealong with smoking it was like I wasfinally free of these chains it wasamazing and from there I just reallyhave felt Unstoppable in the sense thatI can learn anything I have proven tomyself I can do it I liked what I wasdoing I liked programming and so I justwent nuts over it I tried to start myown company I was working like 80 hoursa week my wife and I didn't have a verygood relationship at that point becauseI was working way too hard I really wishI could have done things probably alittle less enthusiastic at that pointyou know fostered a better relationshipwould have been a smarter move I gotrejected from Google I got rejected fromlocal compan I got rejected actually afew times went from the top of the topto the bottom pretty quick but I endedup getting a job at a local place and Ihated it again it's just like man I'm sobored I'm dying here and finally when Ijust made the commitment in my heart I'mgoing to be happy in this situation I'mgoing to find Joy regardless of howentertaining my job is about how much Ilike doing it I am going to have joy Idon't need to be happy because of my jobI kid you not I made that decision on myway to my job that day and as I wasgetting coffee someone from a buildingnext door went hey you program right andI was like yeah I I am a programmer overat schulist and he was just like hey youwant to come work over here I'll giveyou 50% more money I was likeyeah yes yes yes I do and I did it itwas hard it was awful but it was amazingall at the same time it really reallyhelped uplevel me a significant amountand yes it did strain my wife and I'srelationship yes I probably should havesaid no more often but it was alsoreally really good long term for mycareer which is a hard balance to haveand I really didn't have a good way ofsaying no at that point but during allof that I got to go to a conferencewhere I learned about rxjs yes laugh Iknow just laugh about it go ahead laughabout it right rxjs right any who I putthat on my resume that I knew it and Istarted learning and playing with it andguess what happened Netflix was lookingfor people that knew rxjs and they sawthat I did it and they offered meinterview and then I got the job and forme again that shows that hard work witha little bit of luck preparation withtiming and boom I got a great job andI've been there for the last uh you knoweight nine years you know I failed a lotduring that intro part of my story Ifailed a lot it took years upon yearsthere was no magic bullet there was noone night things went from bad to goodit was a decision I made every singlemoment it was a decision I had to makeevery single day multiple times a day todo it right and during this time of theyear this is by the way Christmas season2022 there's this whole idea of NewYear's resolutions and I've always hatedthem because there's not just some pointin time some new turning of the wheel inwhich all the sudden you have theability to be somebody different no makeyour resolution a daily resolution aminute resolution if you have to say noa thousand times 10,000 times you haveto pursue the change you want to be andthere's going to be a ton of really hardmoments I know there's a plenty ofpeople right now in this moment who arejust learning how to program and theyfeel defeated you feel like you're notquite learning it or maybe you're ajunior engineer and you're hating yourjob trust me keep building those skillspursue the things that are good andvaluable and give it time time time timeit just takes a little bit of time ittook me about 6 years you're probablysmarter than me honestly it'll probablytake you way shorter but nonethelessdon't give up quickly keep pursuing keeppushing in now there's lots of parts ofmy story I didn't tell I tried to smoothover the bits but I just wanted to bekind of honest about the higher pointswhich is just like you know I didn'thave a great childhood I didn't have agreat many things in my life but I stilldid something with it and I want you tobe able to do it too hey I hope you likethis story hey hit the like button hitthe sub button mean a lot to me and Ijust been loving building this channelso appreciate you all genuinely thankyou",
    "summary": "This YouTube video, \"From Meth to Netflix,\" chronicles the speaker's personal journey from a troubled youth marked by addiction and suicidal thoughts to a successful software engineer at Netflix. He details a difficult upbringing, including exposure to pornography at a young age, the death of his father, and a lack of parental guidance, leading to drug use, academic struggles, and a feeling of deep despair.  He emphasizes that hard work, not just inherent intelligence, was crucial to turning his life around. A turning point occurred when, after a powerful spiritual experience, he felt a newfound conviction to change his life, though the immediate struggle with addiction persisted.  His dedication to calculus and consistent hard work led to a realization that smarts can get you far but hard work will get you further.\n\nThe speaker underscores that the path to success wasn't linear or easy. Even after achieving academic success and landing initial programming jobs, he faced challenges like job dissatisfaction, marital strain, and rejection.  He highlights the importance of perseverance, making daily choices to overcome struggles, and cultivating a positive mindset, even in undesirable situations.  Ultimately, his willingness to learn new skills, coupled with a bit of luck and timing, led to his dream job at Netflix.  He encourages viewers, particularly aspiring engineers feeling discouraged, to persist in their endeavors, emphasizing that consistent effort over time yields results. The key insight is that success is not about instant transformation, but rather a continuous process of daily decisions and relentless pursuit of goals, regardless of past failures."

    "transcript": "ROB PIKE: Hi, everyone.Wow.Voice is always so big.Thanks for coming.I'm going to be talking today\nabout Go concurrency patterns.My name is Rob Pike, and I work\non the Go team at Google.First of all, let me give\nus a little background.When Go came out in November of\n2009, a lot of people wereimmediately fascinated by the\nfeatures of Go that providedconcurrency, and wanted\nto play withthem and goof around.But also, a lot of people had\nquestions about them.And there's a question\nabout whyconcurrency's even in the language.What exactly do I mean\nby concurrency?What is the origin\nof the ideas?And what is it all useful for?And today I'm going to talk\nabout all those things, butI'm mostly going to talk about\nhow you use the features.But I need to give you\na little background.So if you look around in the\nworld at large, what you seeis a lot of independently\nexecuting things.You see people in the audience\ndoing their own thing,tweeting while I'm talking\nand stuff like that.There's people outside,\nthere's cars going by.All those things are independent\nagents, if youwill, inside the world.And if you think about writing\na computer program, if youwant to simulate or interact\nwith that environment, asingle sequential execution is\nnot a very good approach.And so concurrency is really a\nway of writing or structuringyour program to deal with\nthe real world.And what I mean by concurrency,\nwe define as thecomposition of independently\nexecuting computations.And I want to stress that\nconcurrency is a way ofstructuring software.It's a way of thinking about how\nto write clean code thatcan interact with the real\nworld, and maybe simulate thereal world or behave as an agent\ninside the real world,and be a good actor in\nthat environment.Concurrency is really\nnot parallelism.Although a lot of people got\nconfused by that, and I thinkwhen Go first launched, a lot\nof people thought Go was aparallel language.It's not really a parallel\nlanguage.It's a concurrent one.And one to realize the\ndifference is to imagine--if you have a concurrent piece\nof code that you've writtenthat uses the concurrency\nfeatures of Go or any otherconcurrent language, but you\nonly run it on a singleprocessor, then it's certainly\nnot a parallel program,because it's not executing\nanything in parallel.But it can still have concurrent\nstructure.And even on a single processor,\nthat could be auseful way to model the\nway this stuff works.Now I actually give a talk at\nthe beginning of the year at aHeroku conference, which you can\nfind online, where I talkabout in great detail about what\nthe difference is betweenconcurrency and parallelism.I don't want to spend too\nmuch time on it today.But I want to stress that I'm\ntalking about concurrencyhere, not parallelism.And just to stress this,\nconcurrency is a model forsoftware construction.And the reason it's valuable is\nthat to interact with thereal world, you have to figure\nout how to write your softwareto do that.And concurrency and features\nprovided by Go, but also inother languages, are\neasy to understand.They're easy to use.They're easy to reason about--which is really important,\nbecause you don't need to bean expert to use them.You can use the concurrency\nfeatures of Go withoutunderstanding all of the\nminutiae of memory barriersand threads and condition\nvariables and all the otherstuff that people often think\nof as the standard way toprogram parallel or concurrent\napplications.It's just not true.You can work at a much higher\nlevel and make it a lot easierfor yourself.And in fact, a lot of people\nhave used Go to writeconcurrent programs who've\nnever done concurrentprogramming before, and they\nfind it's actuallyquite easy to do.Now to many people, as I said,\nwhen Go came out, theconcurrency stuff seems kind\nof new and intriguing.It's not actually totally\noriginal.In fact, there's a very long\nhistory of concurrent ideasand programming languages that\nleads towards Go, and I'velisted some of them here.The most important one is\na seminal paper, which Iactually recommend every\ncomputer programmer in theworld should read, is by Tony\nHoare, in 1978, called\"Communicating Sequential\nProcesses.\" And that is thefundamental paper.All the real ideas\nare in there.And all these other languages\nbuild on the ideas from thatpaper to construct real\nprogramming environments.Probably the most original\nlanguage that came out of thiswas this thing called Occam,\nwhich was the programminglanguage for the transputer.It came out in the early '80s.You've mostly probably\nheard of Erlang.And there's another branch that\nI had a role in, withlanguages like Newsqueak\nand Limbo.There's also Concurrent ML, done\nby John Reppy, which isactually a lovely language.It's a functional language,\nbut it's concurrent.It's kind of amazing, but it's\nanother level of intellectualdepth that some programmers\naren't as comfortable with.But it is a beautiful\nlanguage.Go is on the branch of the\nNewsqueak-Limbo-Alef sequence.And the thing that distinguishes\nthem from mostof these others is that it has\nthe idea of a channel as afirst-class value.In the original Hoare CSP, you\ncommunicated directly with aprocess by name, and that's\nessentially the way Erlangstill works today.But in Go, instead you don't\ntalk to a process.You talk to a channel, and the\nother end of that channel issome other thing that could be\nreading the values that you'resending to it.And one way to understand that\ndistinction is that the Erlangoriginal CSP idea is a little\nbit like writing to a file byname, whereas in Go, the channel\nidea is more likewriting to a file descriptor.And the level of indirection\nthat it provides is actuallykind of important to a lot\nof things that get done.But I want to stress that\none model isn'tbetter than the other.They're actually formally\nequivalent.You can write one form in\nterms of the other.But Go definitely is\nabout channels.So enough of this sort of\ntheoretical nonsense.Let's actually show some code.Now one of the problems with\nillustrating concurrentprogramming is that the ideas\ntend to be subtle if you'venever seen them before.And people tend to write\ncomplicated examples todemonstrate them.And I don't want to do that.So instead, I'm going to make\nall of my code today be aroundreally boring things.So these are going to be really\nboring programs, butthey're going to use concurrency\nto make the boringa little less interesting.And this gives it a focus on\nthe concurrency rather thanthe boring elements that\nare actually being madeconcurrent.So here's a particularly\nboring program.All it does is print very\nslowly, once persecond, la la la.Now I'd like to stress,\nactually, what's going on hereis that every time I hit the run\nbutton here-- this is anHTMI5 presentation--it compiles the binary out of\nthe HTML, runs it, and pops upthis window talking with a web\nsocket back to the browser.And it's all done in Go.By doing it this way, you get\nto see the actual coderunning, and you also trust that\nwhat's going on here isreally what I'm showing you.It's really important for the\nconcurrency because timingthings come in.So let's make this program a\nlittle less boring by puttingin a random sleeping interval so\nthat they run a little lessdeterministically, so there's a\nlittle randomness in there.OK.Pretty boring program, right?You still with me?All right.Now let's run this thing.So it's pretty easy.Here's the whole program except\nfor some boilerplate atthe top, and there's the whole\nprogram running out of thething, and la la la.OK.Extremely boring.Good.Now boring things are things\nyou want to ignore.So let's ignore that.To do that, we run the boring\nfunction as a goroutine.I\"ll talk a little bit more\nabout goroutines in a minute.But for now, just think of a\ngoroutine as being analogousto launching a shell command\nwith an ampersand on the endof the line.It says, run this function\nin the background.I don't care about it.I'm just going to keep\nexecuting directly.So let's run this.Something went wrong.That's not actually a bug.This is actually what Go does.What happened down here is\nthat we launched thisgoroutine, and then main\nimmediately returned becausewe didn't have to wait.But the way it Go is defined,\nwhen main returns, the programactually exits.And so this is sort of a\nfeature of Go that'sdeliberate.When main returns, the\nprogram goes away.But it also confuses\npeople, at first.So I put it in the very\nfirst example.So when you run the program, it\nlaunches the goroutine, butthe program returns\nand we're done.So let's make that a little\nmore interesting by doingsomething after we launch\nthe goroutine.So here we launch it, and now\nwe print a couple of thingsout, wait for a while,\nand then exit.So now you can see that, in\nfact, we are running both theboring function and the main\nfunction concurrently.Right?Very, very simple.So what are these goroutines?Well, it's an independently\nexecuting function.You can think of, when you run\na function, normally you waitfor the function to complete,\nand you get the answer back.The goroutine says, run the\nfunction, but I don't want towait for the answer\nto come back.Just go and execute\nindependently of me.So this is the sort of\nfundamental idea of composing.So in Go, concurrency is the\ncomposition of independentlyexecuting goroutines.It's got its own stack.And the stack actually grows\nand shrinks as required.So unlike some threading\nlibraries, where you have tosay how big the stack is, it's\nnever an issue in Go.You don't have to say how\nbig the stack is.It will be made as big as it\nneeds to be, and if the stackgrows, the system will\ntake care of thestack growth for you.And they start out very small.So it's very cheap and practical\nto have thousands oreven tens of thousands of\ngoroutines running.And I'll show you an example,\nlater, where we haveway more than that.And we've even seen large jobs\nrunning in production withmillions of them.So they're very, very\ncheap things.They're not threads.However, for the point of view\nof understanding them, it'snot misleading to think of a\ngoroutine as just an extremelycheap thread.Because that's really, in\neffect, what they are.What happens in the runtime is\ngoroutines are multiplexedonto threads that are created\nas needed in order to makesure no goroutine ever blocks.So you just launch the\ngoroutines, and you don't haveto think about it.And that's kind of the point.Now our example that we ran\nbefore, where we started thegoroutine, printed a bit,\nand then exited, thatwas actually a cheat.Because the goroutines were\nindependently executing, butthey were not communicating or\nsynchronizing their behaviorin any way.I just started this guy, this\nprogram talked, and the otherone kept running, which isn't\na very helpful example.And so to do a proper concurrent\nprogram, you needto be able to communicate\namong thegoroutines inside it.And to do that, there is a\nconcept of a channel in Go.And as I mentioned earlier,\nchannels are sort of afundamental concept in Go.And they're first-class values,\nand they're reallyinteresting.And we'll use them to do\nsome interesting stuff.But the basics are very\nstraightforward.The first block there shows\nyou how to declare andinitialize a channel.So var c chan int says declare\na variable called c that hastype channel of integer.And channels are types, so the\nvalues that go on the channelshave a static type, in\nthis case, int orinteger, default integer.And then to create a channel,\nyou actually have toinitialize it by saying\nmake of chan int.And in Go syntax, you typically\nuse the := notation.So those two lines above are\nequivalent to this c:= make chan int.And you tend to see that kind\nof code all the time.When you want to send a value\non a channel, you use theleft-pointing arrow operator.And so this sends the value\n1 on the channel.And then to receive it, you\nput the arrow on the otherside of the c, and now the\nvalue comes out of thechannel, so that's a\nreceive operation.So if one goroutine says c\ngets 1, then the othergoroutine says, receive from\nc and store the value.That sends this 1 into the\nchannel and then out againinto the variable.And the way to think about the\nmnemonic here is that thearrow points in the direction\nin which the channel issending data.So here, the 1 is pointing\ninto the channel.Here the arrow's pointing out of\nthe channel and deliveringit to the value.So let's use the channel\nto do something.Let's make this program we have\na little more honest.So here's our main function.And now, this time in a loop,\nwe actually say printf, yousay some value, and here is that\nreceive on the channel,which we made up here.And then in the boring function,\nwe just loopforever, sending a printed\nmessage to the channel.So if we run this, you can see\nthe program running, and thenfor five times, it says that.So this is honest, right?This main and the boring\nfunction are independentlyexecuting, but they're\nalso communicatingin the strong sense.So there's a point about what's\ngoing on here, whichis, obviously when you read from\na channel, you have towait for there to be\na value there.It's a blocking operation.But also when you\nsend to a value,it's a blocking operation.When you send a value on a\nchannel, the channel blocksuntil somebody's ready\nto receive it.And so as a result, if the two\ngoroutines are executing, andthis one's sending, and this\none's receiving, whateverthey're doing, when they finally\nreach the point wherethe send and receive are\nhappening, we know that's likea lockstep position.Those two goroutines are at\nthat communication point--the send on this side and the\nreceive on this side.So it's also a synchronization\noperation as well as a sendand receive operation.And channels thus\ncommunicate andsynchronize in a single operation.And that's a pretty\nfundamental idea.Now for those experts in the\nroom who know about bufferedchannels in Go-- which exist--\nyou can create achannel with a buffer.And buffered channels have the\nproperty that they don'tsynchronize when you send,\nbecause you can just drop avalue in the buffer\nand keep going.So they have different\nproperties.And they're kind of subtle.They're very useful for certain\nproblems, but youdon't need them.And we're not going to use them\nat all in our examplestoday, because I don't want\nto complicate lifeby explaining them.But the thing about buffered\nchannels is they're much morelike mailboxes in Erlang, so\nI thought it was worthmentioning.OK so given this idea of\ncommunication coupled withsynchronization that Go's\nchannels provide, the Goapproach to concurrent software\ncan be characterizedas, don't communicate\nby sharing memory.Share memory by communicating.In other words, you don't have\nsome blob of memory and thenput locks and mutexes and\ncondition variables around itto protect it from\nparallel access.Instead, you actually use the\nchannel to pass the data backand forth between the goroutines\nand make yourconcurrent program\noperate that way.So based on those principles,\nwe can now start to do some,what I call, concurrency\n\"patterns.\" And I put it inquotes because I don't want you\nto think of these as beinglike object-oriented patterns.They're just very simple,\nlittle, tiny examples that dointeresting things.So the first and probably most\nimportant concurrency patternis what I call a generator,\nwhich is a function thatreturns a channel.So all of these examples for the\nnext few slides are goingto be variants of the things I\nshowed you before, but I'mgoing to do them in\ndifferent ways.So in this case, what we do is\nwe take our boring function,and we give it a return value.We say that this boring function\nis going to return achannel of string, and this\nless-than means that thereturn value is a channel that\nyou can only receive frombecause the main function is\nonly going to use it as areceived value.So in this case, in the main\nfunction, we call the boringfunction, and it returns\nthe channel.And then this is the\nsame as before.We just receive and print the\nvalues that come out.And in the boring function,\ninstead of sort of loopingforever, with the goroutine\nbeing launched in main, weactually launch the goroutine\ninside theboring function itself.You can see here,\nit says go func.This is a function literal.So this is the loop that we had\nbefore, but it's wrappedinside an anonymous function\nliteral and then launched witha Go keyword at the top.And so this starts the\ncomputation and then returnsback to the caller the channel\nwith which to communicate tothat process that's running,\nthat goroutine.And so from the outside, this\njust looks like a functionwhose invocation returns a\nchannel, and internally, itactually starts a computation\nrunning concurrently.So let's run that.This will behave exactly the\nsame way, but now we've got amuch nicer pattern for\nconstructing this service.And in fact, this is very much\nlike having a service.We could use multiple instances\nof this boringfunction, give them different\nnames, and we'd have differentservices, each of which\nare talking to us.So here's a simple example where\nwe actually launch theboring function twice, and then\nin the loop, just print avalue from Joe and\na value from Ann.And it's exactly the same boring\nfunction as previously.We're just using it in\na different way.So you can see, you get a 0 from\nJoe and Ann, a 1 from Joeand Ann, a 2 from Joe\nand Ann, and so on.Now inside here, we're reading\na value from Joe anda value from Anne.And because of the\nsynchronization nature of thechannels, the two guys are\ntaking turns, not only inprinting the values out, but\nalso in executing them.Because if Ann is ready to send\na value but Joe hasn'tdone that yet, Ann will still be\nblocked, waiting to deliverthe value to main.Well, that's a little annoying\nbecause maybe Ann is moretalkative than Joe and doesn't\nwant to wait around.So we can get around that by\nwriting a fan-in function or amultiplexer.And to do that--here's this fan-in function--we actually stitch the two guys\ntogether with the fan-infunction and construct a single\nchannel, from which wecan receive from both of them.And the way to think of it is\na little bit like this.Here's Joe, and here's Ann,\nand they're both talking.And then the fan-in function\nhere is taking values from Joeand values from Ann and just\nforwarding them on to theoutput of the fan-in function.Right?And to do that, again, it's\nusing the generator pattern.The fan-in function is\nitself a functionthat returns a channel.It takes two channels as input,\nreturns another channelas its return value.And what we do is, again, make\nthe channel and return it.But internally, we launch two\nindependent goroutines, onecopying the output from input1\nto the channel, and the otherone copying the data from\ninput2 to the channel.So when we call fanIn of boring\nJoe and boring Ann,remember, they return\nchannels.They become the arguments to the\nfan-in function, and thenwe launch two more goroutines\nto copy the data.And so we run this guy.Ann and Joe are now completely\nindependent.And you can see, when it runs,\nthat they run in notnecessarily sequential order.Because there's Joe gives three\ncommunications in a row,there, before Ann had anything\nelse to say.OK?So that decouples the execution\nof those guys.So even though it's all\nsynchronous, they canindependently execute.So what if, for some reason, we\nactually don't want that?We wanted to have them be\ntotally lockstep andsynchronous.Well to do that, remember I\nsaid these channels arefirst-class values in Go.That means that we can pass\na channel on a channel.And so we can send inside a\nchannel another channel to beused for the answer\nto come back.To do this, what we do is we\nconstruct a message structurethat includes the message that\nwe want to print, and weinclude inside there another\nchannel that is what we call await channel.And that's like a signaler.And the guy will block on the\nwait channel until the personsays, OK, I want you\nto go ahead.So let's see how that works.So here's our main loop--again, just five times\naround the loop.We receive a message from the\nfirst person and send it--this is, again, the fan-in\nfunctions on theother side of this.Receive another one and print\nthat, and then wait them out.Now notice that this is\nmessage1 and message2.They have channels inside them\nthat are the guys that aregoing to be used to\ndo the sequencing.So inside the boring functions,\nnow, we have thiswait-for-it channel, and then\neverybody blocks, waiting fora signal to advance.So when we run it now, you can\nsee they're back in lockstep,because even though the timing\nis random, the sequencinghere, with message1 wait and\nmessage2 wait, means that theindependently executing guys\nare waiting on differentchannels for the signal\nto advance.Now that's all fairly simple\nand kind of silly.We can make it a little more\ninteresting by using the nextpart of concurrency in Go, which\nis the select statement.And the select statement is a\ncontrol structure, somewhatlike a switch, that lets you\ncontrol the behavior of yourprogram based on what\ncommunications are able toproceed at any moment.And in fact, the select\nstatement is really sort of akey part of why concurrency is\nbuilt into Go as features ofthe language, rather than\njust a library.It's hard to control structuresthat depend on libraries.It's much easier this way.So here's how a select\nstatement works.It looks kind of complicated.There's a lot of text\non this slide.But it's really pretty simple.A select statement looks\nlike a switch.It's got a bunch of cases.And each case, instead of\nbeing an expression, isactually a communication.So you can see, there's\na receive, areceive, and a send.And what happens in this select\nstatement is when youcome to the top of the select,\nit evaluates all of thechannels that could be used for\ncommunication inside thecases, and then it blocks\nuntil one ofthem is ready to run.And once one is available to\nrun, that case executes, andthe whole select goes on.So it's much like a regular\nswitch statement, except itblocks until a communication\ncan proceed.And there's a default that you\ncan put inside a select.If there's no default, then the\nselect will block foreveruntil the channel can proceed.If there is a default, what\nit means is, if nobody canproceed right away, then just\nexecute the default.And this gives you way to do\nnon-blocking communication.We're not going to depend on\nthat, but I just wanted tomake sure you knew\nit was there.So it's really pretty simple.The only other sort of wrinkle\nis that sometimes multiplechannels are available\nat the same time.When that happens, the select\nstatement chooses onepseudo-randomly.So you can't depend on the\norder in which thecommunications will proceed.Those of you who know Dijkstra's\nguarded commandswill recognize the\npattern there.It's very much like the guarded\nif statement insideDijkstra's commands.So here's our fan-in function.Same functionality, but now\nwritten using select.So here's our old guy.This is exactly the function\nwe had before, you can see.And here's the new one using\nthe select statement.If I go back and forth, you can\nsee the difference is, theoriginal guy started two\ngoroutines, one for each inputchannel to be copied\nto the output.The new guy starts a single\ngoroutine because it's stillgot that generator pattern.But instead of two copy loops,\nit runs one copy loop, and itselects which of the two is\nready and passes the data onappropriately.So this has exactly the same\nbehavior as the other one,except that we're only launching\none goroutine insidethe fan-in function.Same idea, different\nimplementation.Now we can use selects\nto do all kindsof interesting things.One of the most important is\nwe can use it to time out acommunication.So if you're talking to somebody\nwho's very boring,chances are you don't want to\nwait very long for them to getaround to saying something.So in this case, we can simulate\nthat with a call to afunction in the library\ncalled time.After.And here, this select statement\nsays either we canget a message from Joe, or a\nsecond's gone by, and hehasn't said anything,\nin which case, we'lljust get out of here.So time.After is a function\ninside the standard librarythat returns a channel that will\ndeliver a value after thespecified interval.So in this case, either we get\na message, or a second goesby, and we don't get a message,\nand then we finish.So if we run it, you can see,\nJoe goes for a while.And then he takes too long to\nsay something, and so we exit.OK?I think it always does this.I think I forgot to seed it.It's always saying\nthe same thing.All right.But you see the idea.We just keep going around this\nloop until the timeout fires.Now you can do that\nanother way.We might decide, instead of\nhaving a conversation whereeach message is at most one\nsecond, we might just want atotal time elapsed.And to do that, we can use the\ntime.After channel moredirectly by just saving it\ninside a timeout channel andusing it inside the\nselect statement.So in this case, this loop, this\nentire loop will time outafter five seconds.So it doesn't matter how many\ntimes Joe says anything.After five seconds,\nwe're out there.Boom.OK?So that times out\nthe whole loop.The difference, here, is we're\ntiming out each message.Here, we're timing out the\nwhole conversation.Now another thing you can do\nwith a select is instead ofusing a timeout, you could\nactually deterministicallysay, OK, I'm done.Stop now.So here's our inner loop again,\nthe select inside theinner loop.There's the send\non the message.But we actually have a second\ncase which is a quit channel.And what we do there is in the\nmain function, we create somequit channel.In this case, it doesn't\nmatter what type it is.I just picked bool.And then after we've printed as\nmany times we want what hehas to say, we signal\nhim and say, OK.I'm done.And so at that point, this case\ncan proceed, because thisguy's not communicating and\nwill eventually stop.So again, this is the same\nthing as before.But now after only two\nexecutions, wedecide that's enough.We tell him to quit.And so the quit case executes\nin the select, the functionreturns, and the boring\nconversation is over.Now there's a problem with\nthat model, though.Because in here, in this case,\nwhat if after this function isdone, he needs to do something\ninside here?So he gets the message to stop,\nbut he might have somecleanup functions to do.Remember that when main returns\nfrom a Go program, thewhole thing shuts down.Maybe he's got to remove\nsome temporary files orsomething like that.We want to make sure that he's\nfinished before we reallyexit, and so we need to do a\nslightly more sophisticatedcommunication.And it's very easy to do that.We just turn around and say,\nsend me a message back whenyou're done.And so in this case, we say\n\"Bye!\" But then Joe gets themessage on the quit statement,\ndoes a cleanup, and then tellsyou, OK, I'm done.And this gives synchronization\nfor the two programs, to makesure that they're both where\nthey want to be.So in this case, you see we tell\nhim \"Bye!\" And then thequit fires.We do whatever cleanup\nis required.Then we respond.But now we're telling him that\nwe're done for sure, and soit's safe for him to exit.And this is a round-trip\ncommunication.Now speaking of round-trips, we\ncan also make this crazy byhaving a ridiculously long\nsequence of these things, onetalking to another one.So think of it like this.You've got a whole bunch of\ngophers who want to do aChinese Whispers game, although\nI think ChineseWhispers with megaphones\nmight sort ofmake it a little weird.But you see the idea, here.This guy's sends a message\nto him, sends a message--forwards it, forwards\nit, forwards it.And the last guy receives the\nmessage and prints it out.Now I want to stress that\nthis is not a loop.This is just going all the way\naround the chain, back to theanswer here.And to make it interesting--this is the gopher here--what he does is receive\nfrom the left--sorry, receive from the\nright, because thisis where it's going.Coming in from the right.Sending to the left.So you receive on the right.And then we make it a channel\nof integers, so I'mgoing to add 1.And the reason for that is, that\nlets us count the numberof steps, so the distortion in\nthe Chinese Whispers game iswe add 1 to the value.And I'm not going to\ngo through all thedetails of this code.This is actually sort of subtle,\nand I don't wantexplain it all.But all it does is basically\nconstruct this diagram usingchannels to send the\nanswers along.And then everybody's\nwaiting for thefirst thing to be sent.And so we launch the value into\nthe first channel andthen wait for it to come out\nof the leftmost guy.So it goes, vvvvt, around\nthe channel.And for the sake of fun, I'm\ngoing to run 100,000 gophers.Now remember that I'm going to\ncompile the program, link it,and then run it.And it takes that long to do\n100,000 goroutines and all thecommunication.[APPLAUSE]ROB PIKE: Those are\nsome fast gophers.OK.Now this is obviously\na silly example, butit's an honest one.Because I really am creating all\nthose elements and doingthe full communication and\nthe whole shebang.So you can think of goroutines\nas being very, verylightweight things.They're even smaller\nthan gophers.OK.But so far, everything we've\nbeen doing is very toy-like.And I want to stress that Go\nwas designed for buildingsystem software.And I want to talk now about\nhow we use these ideas toconstruct the kind of software\nthat we care about.Now we did this at Google, and\nso what we're going to do isbuild a Google search engine.Sort of.It's still going to be a toy.I can't develop a Google search\nengine in less thanabout a half an hour, and\nI only have 15 minutes.But we can start.So think about what a\nGoogle search does.If you're going to the Google\nweb page and you run a search,you get a bunch of\nanswers back.And some might be web pages,\nthere could be videos, therecould be song clips, or weather\nreports, or whatever.There's a bunch of independently\nexecuting backends that are looking at that\nsearch for you and findingresults that are interesting.And there might also be some\nads, so there's an ad systemrunning, too.And so in parallel, you want\nto send all of these thingsout to the back ends and then\ngather all the answers backand deliver them.How do we actually\nstructure that?Well, let's fake\nit, completely.Let's construct a thing called\na fakeSearch, and all ourfakeSearch is going to do is\nsleep for a while and thenreturn whatever the fake answer\nis that it wants, whichis very uninteresting.It says, here's your result.But the point is that there's\nmultiple of them.And it's actually a function.So notice here, this search is\na function that takes a queryand returns a result.So that's sort of a type\ndefinition for what a searchactually does.And we construct these functions\nfor a web, an image,and a video service.OK?Very simple.All they do is pause for a\nwhile, and then print.And they're set to wait for\nup to 100 milliseconds.So let's test it out.So here--this time I'm going to seed the\nrandom number generator,so the values are always\ndifferent.And we start the timer, get the\nresults from the search,and then print out\nhow long it took.OK?So if I run this guy, you can\nsee that was 168 milliseconds.Now remember, each of these guys\ncould take up to about100 milliseconds.So we could see up to, like,\n300 milliseconds, maybe.There's 160.There's 94, that was\na quick one.213, that was a slow one.So these are actually, you\nknow, running these guys.OK.Now let's make it an actual real\nfunction that returns allof the values back, right?So here, we actually have this\nGoogle function that takes aquery and queries all of the\nback ends and gathers all ofthe results together and returns\nback a slice of theresults, which is--think of it as just an\narray of results.So here we run this guy, and\nyou can see, there are thethree things, taking\na little longer togather all of the data.OK.Trivia, right?The problem is that if you\nthink about it, this isrunning one guy, waiting for\nhis answer to come back,running another one, waiting for\nhis answer to come back,running a third one, waiting for\nhis answer to come back.Well, you know where\nthis is going.Why don't we launch those\nin goroutines?So now for each of the back\nends, we independently launcha goroutine to do the search,\nand then-- thisis the fan-in pattern--get the data back on\nthe same channel.And then we can just print\nthem out as they arrive.So they're going to come out of\norder now, but we're goingto get all three of them back.But they're running\nconcurrently, and actually inparallel, in this case.And so we don't have to wait\naround nearly as long.So there, we see,\n76 milliseconds.That's pretty quick.88 milliseconds.Now we're really only waiting\nfor the slowest, the singleslowest web search.15 milliseconds.There you go.So that's pretty cool.And notice that this is a\nparallel program, now, withmultiple back ends running.But we don't have any\nmutexes or locksor condition variables.The model of Go's concurrency\nis taking care of theintricacy of setting up and\nrunning this safely.Now sometimes, servers\ntake a long time.They can be really,\nreally slow.So remember, we set these\nup for 100 milliseconds.Once in a while, an individual\nsearch might take more than 80milliseconds.And let's say we don't want to\nwait more than a total of 80milliseconds for the\nwhole thing to run.We want to use the timeout\npattern now.So here's the fan-in pattern,\nand here's the timeout for thewhole conversation.We run this guy now, and\n81 milliseconds.That was pretty quick.44 milliseconds.You see, these are\nfairly quick now.They're typically 80\nmilliseconds or less, which iswhat they should be, because\nwe never wait.But if I run this\nenough times--there.We timed out because, in\nthis case, two of thequeries took too long.And so all we got back\nwas the web result.We didn't get the other two.And that's a kind\nof nice idea.We know that we're going to be\nable to get you an answerwithin 80 milliseconds.However, timing out acommunication is kind of annoying.What if the server really is\ngoing to take a long time?It's kind of a shame to\nthrow it on the floor.So now we add replication.So if we run three instances of\nthe service, say, or five,one of them is likely\nto come backbefore the timeout expires.If only one of them is having a\nproblem, the other ones canall be efficient.So how do we structure that?Well, here's our familiar\npattern by now.We actually write a function\ncalled First that takes aquery and a set of replicas--this is the Go notation for\na variadic function--so we have a bunch of replicas\nof a search that we're goingto do, for a single search.Like, replicas of the web search\nor replicas of theimage search.And we make the channel\nof results.And then we launch the same\nsearch multiple times and thenreturn the first one\nthat comes back.See, all these guys are going\nto talk on the channel, butwe're only going to return the\nfirst one that we get.And so this will give us the\nfirst result from all thoseback end guys.So here's a simple use of it,\nwhere we run two replicas.And that time we got replica\n2 in 30 milliseconds.Replica 2, Replica 1 in 24.So you can see, it's whichever\none comes back first.There's five milliseconds.And with that little tool, now,\nwe can build the nextpiece, which is to stitch all\nof this magic together.So this is Google Search\n3.0, full on.It's got everything in it.It has the fan-in function, it's\ngot the replicated backend stuff, it's got a timeout\non everybody.And so we should, with very,\nvery high probability now, getall three of our web search\nresults back in less than 80milliseconds.So there's 40 milliseconds,\n56 milliseconds.You notice, they're\nall three there.There's no timeouts.18, 39, 51.And this is obviously\na toy example.But you can see how we're using\nthe concurrency ideas inGo to build, really, a fairly\nsophisticated, parallel,replicated, robust thing.And that's kind of\nthe message.Because it's very simple\nto do that.There's still none of that sort\nof minutiae of memorybarriers and nonsense that\npeople who use threadingapproaches are aware of.And there's no callback, so this\nis very different fromusing, like, node.js, or\nsomething like that.That program is fairly\neasy to understand.More important, the individual\nelements of the program areall just straightforward\nsequential code.And we're composing their\nindependent execution to giveus the behavior of\nthe total server.So to summarize what we just did\nthere, we started with avery simple program that was\nslow and consequential andfailure-sensitive, at least\nwe pretended it is.And by using the concurrency\nideas in Go, we made that samestuff run quickly, concurrently,\nin a replicatedway, and with much\nmore robustness.And this is sort\nof the lesson.This was actually why\nthe concurrencyfeatures went into Go.It's because it makes it easy\nto go from this to thiswithout worrying about safety\nissues and things like that.It's just a very much more\nstraightforward approach toconstructing what I loosely\ndescribe as server software.There's all kinds\nof party tricks.This is barely, barely touching\nthe surface, andthere'll probably have to be a\ntalk again soon with a lotmore rich examples using\nother features that Ihaven't shown you today.But there's lots of talks\non the web already, withindependent things about using\nGo concurrency stuff to solvesome interesting problems.There's a Chatroulette toy,\nwhich Andrew talked about,that has a fairly amazing little\ninner loop in it thatyou should probably check out.A couple of years ago at I/O, I\ntalked about a dynamic loadbalancer which uses channels\nas first-class values toconstruct some pretty\ninteresting stuff.There's a legendary example\ncalled the Concurrent PrimeSieve, which is kind of\nan amazing thing.It was the first truly beautiful\nconcurrent program Ithink I ever saw.But it's completely dwarfed by\nthis work by Doug McIlroy,who's my old boss at Bell Labs,\nwho wrote a concurrentpower series library using a\npredecessor language to Go.And it treats the coefficients\nof a power series as values ina channel, sequential\nvalues in a channel.And using some very simple\ntricks, very much like what Ijust showed you, it manages to\ndo some incredibly high-levelmathematics that is very, very\ndifficult to do any other way.It's really rather beautiful.So there's the links if you\nwant to check them out.Now having just said how\nwonderful all this is, I wantto throw out a word\nof caution.This stuff is fun.It's really fun to write your\nfirst concurrent programs andplay around with this stuff.And you should definitely try\nthem out and do things to seehow they behave.But don't overdo it.These ideas in Go and, for\nthat matter, the otherlanguages I mentioned, are not\nnot replacements for thingslike memory barriers to protectthe innards of software.They're really sort of\nhigh-level building block-likethings that you use to take\nsimple pieces of and connectthem together into larger\nconcurrent things.They're big ideas.They're really tools for\nprogram construction.Remember, I said concurrency\nis a model for softwareconstruction?These concurrent tools are\nmodels for softwareconstruction.But sometimes, you don't\nneed that much power.If you need a reference counter,\nyou could write onewith a channel on a goroutine.It's fun to do that\nas an exercise.But I didn't show you that,\nbecause I thinkthat's a silly example.It's using much too heavyweight\na tool for a verysimple thing.So Go has these packages in\nthe sync directory, calledatomic and-- what was the\nother one called?Sync and sync/atomic.And they contain these low-level\nguys for things likereference counters when\nthat's all you need.And sometimes it is\nall you need.So you have to balance the\nsort of program structureyou're doing.Glue together the large things\nwith these tools I've shownyou, but sometimes if all you\nwant to do is count the numberof times somebody hits your\npage, all you really need is areference counter.So as always, you should use\nthe right tool for the job.So in conclusion, goroutines\nand channels are theconcurrent features of Go.And they make it very, very easy\nto construct interestingconcurrent software that solves\nreal-world problemsthat include things like having\nmultiple inputs, havingmultiple outputs, independent\nexecution, timeouts, failures,replication, robustness.All those things that are sort\nof features of the modernprogramming landscape, Go\nactually gives you the toolsto manage very, very well.And it's actually--even if you're dealing with\nboring people, it's actuallykind of fun to work with.So here's some links for you.I think that's the last slide.I'll just leave that one up so\nyou can look at these duringthe question period.The Go home page, golang.org,\nhas tons and tons ofresources, videos, the language\nspec, packagedocumentation, of which there's\na phenomenal amount,lots of second-order documents\nlike tutorials and blog postsand stuff like that.And then at the bottom and\nbarely readable down at thebottom here, there's this\ntinyurl.com link to my talk atthe Heroku conference earlier\nthis year, about concurrencyis not parallelism, which also\nhas some other examples thatare a little richer than some of\nthe other ones I showed youtoday, because today\nI was reallyconcentrating on the basics.So with that, I'll stop and\nmaybe take some questions.[APPLAUSE]ROB PIKE: Go to the microphones,\nplease, so thatthe people at home\ncan play along.AUDIENCE: So one question I\nhad-- so the only other tool,I think, that competes with Go\nfor concurrency support isHaskell, which I\nuse regularly.And Haskell does feature somespeculative parallel operators.I was wondering if those might\never appear in Go.ROB PIKE: Haskell is a\nbeautiful language.It's a really lovely language.But it has a very, very\ndifferent model.And I think, to my mind, the\nfunctional stuff sort of comesfor free with Haskell, but the\nwhole idea behind the languageis the lazy evaluation\nkind of stuff.And I think it's an excellent\nfit for Haskell.I don't think it's a\ngood fit for Go.And in fact, Doug McIlroy took\nthe concurrent power seriesexample and rewrote\nit in Haskell.And it's a very beautiful\nprogram that I can'tunderstand at all.But it's very beautiful.So I'm not trying to make\nfun of Haskell.I'm really not, because it\nis amazing language.But I think that the key point\nabout the way the concurrencyfeatures work in Go is that they\nwork with the way Go, asa language, also works.And you can't just borrow a\nfeature from another languageand stick it in yours and\nexpect it to work well.That art of choosing\nwhat to put in yourlanguage is part of it.So this is not to say\nat all those ideasaren't really powerful.I just don't think they're\na good match for Go.And if it turns out that\nI'm wrong, maybethey should go in.But offhand, I don't think\nthey're a good fit.Yes.AUDIENCE: Can you comment on\nbest practices for testinggoroutines?Because it seems like you're\nquasi-integration testing.Or are there mocks\nfor goroutines?Or how would you\ngo about that?ROB PIKE: So best--it's hard to hear you.So best practices for testing\nconcurrent code?AUDIENCE: Exactly.And for testing goroutines.ROB PIKE: Best practices.Write good tests.[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]ROB PIKE: Are you worried about\nthe non-determinism?AUDIENCE: Well, It seems like,\nif you think about goroutinesas external services, you're\nthinking about basicallyintegration testing.ROB PIKE: Well, one of the\namazing things about--let me back up here.It's actually kind of a\nnon-issue because of the waythe language works.So let me find the example\nI'm looking for.Where is it?Actually, I went back\nway too far.I could have used a\nmuch earlier one.Here we go.Look.Look at this guy here,\nthis example.The total interface to this\nservice is a channel.Nowhere does this function here\nknow what that channelhas behind it.It's just this function\nin the backgroundthat's doing something.It could be an arbitrarily\ncomplex computation.And once you realize that that\nchannel is, in effect, thecapability to a service, you can\nmock this service with asimple thing.In fact, this might be a mock\nfor a service that returnsvalues at arbitrary intervals.So I mean, it's a perfectly\ngood question, but all thetools I've shown you to do\nthat are right here.You don't need--the whole idea of a channel\nis that it hideswhat's behind it.And so that's mocking,\nright there.You've got it.AUDIENCE: Right.Because it's a first-class--ROB PIKE: It's a first-clas\ncitizen in the language.AUDIENCE: --that's your mock.ROB PIKE: Right.AUDIENCE: Thanks.ROB PIKE: Cool.Sorry.Let me get to the slide you\nreally want to look at.There we go.OK.Yes.AUDIENCE: Hi.My question is somehow related\nbecause I really like the wayyou take concurrency as a\nfirst-classing language.For instance, in typed language,\nyou do the staticanalysis of the types, runtime\nanalysis of the types, andeverything works right.Do you plan on doing something\nsimilar in Go?Signs in a way that--OK.If you do this, you're going\nto write to that lock or ifyou keep doing this, you're\ngoing to have a lock Or youare going to have a bottleneck\nthe way you have arranged allthese patterns.Do the Go compilers go through\nany kind of prettification ofthe concurrency properties\nof your program?ROB PIKE: I'm sorry.I'm having a really hard time\nunderstanding you because thespeakers are pointing\nbackwards,and I'm behind them.You're asking about the static\nchannel network and how wetypecheck that kind of thing?AUDIENCE: Go is great for\nwriting concurrency programs,but do you plan or do you do\nany kind of verification ofthat concurrency, either\nstatically or at runtime?ROB PIKE: OK.So you want to know\nabout staticverification of the thing?For that kind of thing, I think\nindependent tools arethe way to go.There's a thread sanitizer\nproject that is coming out.I don't know if it's\nactually out yet.Is it out yet?Yeah, it is.It's from Google.And they have support for\nthe Go environment.And so you can embed the\nthread-sanitized version ofthe world inside your program,\nand it will actually look fordata races and stuff like\nthat, if that matters.From a communication point of\nview, tools like the SPINthing that Gerard Holzmann did,\nstuff like that I thinkis a really good way to model\nthese kinds of things forstatic checking.And a long time ago, Gerard\ndid some stuff for us tostatically verify pieces of\nthe Plan 9 kernel and itscommunication andsynchronization stuff using SPIN.And I've been thinking of\nactually approaching him andasking him to support Go's\nprimitives, so he can actuallyread a Go program and generate a\nSPIN model for it and verifyit statically.And I think that's actually\nfairly straightforward to do,but it hasn't been done.AUDIENCE: Thank you.ROB PIKE: Please speak\ncarefully and slowlyso I can hear you.AUDIENCE: So I have\ntwo questions.I hope it's OK.You showed us a read from a\ntime.After channel inside aselect and inside a loop.Say I wanted to write\ntime.After.How would I know from the other\nside that the channelhas fallen out of scope so as\nto not be locked forever,waiting for the read.ROB PIKE: You mean,\nhow do you know--so this guy, if the timeout\ndoesn't fire,what happens to him?AUDIENCE: Yeah, and what happens\nto the code that's inon the other side.ROB PIKE: It'll get\ngarbage-collected.AUDIENCE: So--ROB PIKE: So if you want to\nknow that-- if this is aricher example, and this is not\ntime.After but some morecomplicated thing, you want to\nknow that he got your message?That's this example\nright here.AUDIENCE: No, I actually want\nto know, on the other side.If I'm writing the time.After\nfunction, and I wait my time,and then write to\nthe channel--ROB PIKE: Right.AUDIENCE: But the write locks\nme until it is read--ROB PIKE: Right.AUDIENCE: So if it, instead of\nbeing read, it never gets readand the channel falls out of\nscope, will I just be lockedthere, and then I will be\ngarbage-collected completely?ROB PIKE: Yep.It's actually--there's more subtlety\nthan that, but yeah.I mean, you shouldn't\nbe worryingabout it at this level.That's the short\nversion of it.The time.After function uses\nsome of these ideas, but it'sslightly more sophisticated\nthan the basicstuff I've shown you.If you really care about when\nyour resource is released,then you have to write more\nsophisticated code than someof the stuff I've shown you.There is some stuff in the\nGoogle stuff where there'sblocking going on behind\nthe scenes that'salso hidden from you.In the time available, I can't\ngo through all of thesubtleties of that.That's probably a subject\nfor another talk.AUDIENCE: OK.But essentially, if I am locked\non that channel thatgets garbage-collected, so no\none is going to unlock me, Iwill be garbage-collected,\nno problem, right?ROB PIKE: In many cases, yes.It depends on the specific\nexample.AUDIENCE: Second question is,\nhow did you do the any numberof stacks that grow\nindependently?ROB PIKE: I'm sorry,\nI can't hear you.AUDIENCE: The any number\nof stacks that growindependently.ROB PIKE: YepAUDIENCE: Are you allocating the\nstack frames on the heap?How do you do that?ROB PIKE: They're allocated and\nmanaged, yes, by the heap.They have a special allocator.They're not garbage-collected\nin the standard collector,because we know more\nabout them.But they're allocated and\nfree fairly cheaply.AUDIENCE: Thanks.ROB PIKE: Sorry.I'm having trouble\nhearing you.AUDIENCE: I was wondering\nabout the select controlstructure that you had.You were saying that if multiple\ncases are ready atthe same time, then you\npseudo-randomly choose one,rather than evaluating\nthem in order.Is there a way to write it\nso that you could have ahigher-priority case if\nyou wrote it first?Or would you just have to\nnest them or something?ROB PIKE: You would nest them.AUDIENCE: You'd put the default\nas another select.ROB PIKE: Yeah.One of the many properties of\nGo is we tried to take awaythings like priorities and\nfine-tuning adjustments andstuff like that.There's enough power here to do\nthat kind of stuff, but youhave to write more code, as\nopposed to making the APIreally complicated.So you can do prioritized stuff\nin select, but yeah.You basically nest\nthem to do it.You put the guys you care\nabout most first, and ifthey're not ready, then you\ntry the other ones.AUDIENCE: Gotcha.OK.ROB PIKE: This is somewhat\nrelated to the earlierquestion but a little\nbit more specific.So is there a way, if you create\na channel, to determinehow many readers or writers\nthere are for a given channel?AUDIENCE: Yeah. there's a\nbuilt-in function you can useto see how many values are in a\nbuffered channel, if it's abuffered channel.For a non-buffered channel like\nthese, there is no way atthe moment to find out\nhow many readers andwriters there are.One of the reasons for that\nis any such question isinherently unsafe.Because if you care how many\nreaders and writers there are,then that's because you're going\nto do some computationbased on that.But that computation might be\nwrong by the time you end updoing the computation,\nbecause the number ofvalues could change.When you have this kind of thing\nit's much more rigorous,because you know this\ncommunication actuallyproceeded, and there's\nno doubt about that.If you say, can I proceed?OK, I'll get a value.You don't know that someone else\nmight have come in andstolen that value, and you\ndidn't know about it.AUDIENCE: Right.ROB PIKE: So it's actually\nsort of animportant point there.AUDIENCE: The example I was\nthinking of is, let's say inyour main method, you\ncreate a channel.And then you attempt to read\nfrom that channel, but thereare no writers to\nthat channel.Or the inverse, you attempt to\nwrite to that channel, butthere are no readers.ROB PIKE: Right.AUDIENCE: Do you just\nblock indefinitely?Or--ROB PIKE: Yeah.AUDIENCE: Does it\ndetermine that--OK.So it doesn't determine--ROB PIKE: You'll have to-- you\nknow, if there's multiplewriters, then the first guy to\nget there gets the firstvalue, is how it works.And it's FIFO semantics.AUDIENCE: OK.Thank you.ROB PIKE: Yep.Any other questions?All right, at the back there's\nthe usual collection ofgoodies to be handed\nout carefully.Please don't mob the\nhelpful staff.And thanks for coming.[APPLAUSE]",
    "summary": "Rob Pike's \"Go Concurrency Patterns\" talk at Google I/O 2012 provides a comprehensive introduction to concurrency in Go, distinguishing it from parallelism and highlighting its role in structuring software to interact effectively with the real world. Pike emphasizes that concurrency is about the composition of independently executing computations, making it easier to reason about and manage interactions with external systems, simulate real-world scenarios, and build robust server software. He traces the history of concurrency concepts, citing Tony Hoare's CSP and languages like Occam and Erlang, and explains Go's unique approach with channels as first-class values for communication and synchronization between goroutines.\n\nThe core of the presentation revolves around practical concurrency patterns illustrated through simple, albeit boring, code examples. These patterns include generators (functions returning channels), fan-in functions (multiplexing data from multiple channels), and the use of `select` statements for managing communications, timeouts, and quit signals. He demonstrates how these patterns can be composed to build more complex systems, culminating in a toy Google search engine example showcasing replication and robustness. By using the tool he was able to showcase how building these solutions in Go can be achieved in a far easier way compared to using other methods like threads. \n\nPike cautions against overusing concurrency and emphasizes the importance of choosing the right tool for the job, highlighting the availability of lower-level synchronization primitives like `sync/atomic` for simpler tasks. His presentation effectively demonstrates how Go's concurrency features enable developers to build scalable, resilient, and maintainable software without the complexities of traditional threading models."

    "transcript": "it's no secret that I'm a pretty big fanof serverless even if I just put out avideo about why we're moving off of itthat doesn't mean I'm moving all mythings off in fact I was a new servicethat we built for upload thing generallyspeaking everything I build is stillbuilt around serverless paradigms but Ihaven't taken the time recently to breakdown why and to really showcase thetruth of serverless I've also not beenable to do it without a certain sponsorbehind me not that they ever hadmeaningful influence over the things Isaid about serverless but I'm hopingthat we can have a bit more of atrustworthy conversation about itbecause there's a lot of things thatpeople do and don't understand aboutbuilding serverless applications therealso some fun little secrets that Ithink people have missed about whatmakes serverless applications in theserverless mindset for building reallyreally great for most softwaredevelopers that doesn't mean we don'thave a sponsor today though so let'squickly hear from them today's sponsoris Prisma you probably know them fortheir omm but what if I told you theyactually have one of the best databaseproducts available today you might besurprised about Prisma postgress becauseI hadn't heard about it until recentlyand is mindblowing they're notexaggerating when they say it's threeclicks to deploy it's absurd it's likeversel levels of DX but for databasesetups and you get five projects on thefree tier which is insane that's a lotof database to be hosting for free andit has some features that I've honestlynever seen before that are super coollike I'm just going to command f forcash what at the database level at theorm level you can put in a cash strategyand now you won't even have to connectto the database to get that value backit'll be instant on their Edge Networkso cool and it's also serverless readyfor all of us hosting on things likeversel and netlify they'll pull theconnections so you don't have to worryabout hitting the server too hard it'sit's so good oh and for those of you wholike real-time updates in your serverswhen something changes in the databasethey got you covered you can stream inresults so you can call Prisma do user.stream here and now you'll get aresponse in in event stream wheneversomething happens how cool is thatsetting this stuff up yourself is notfun I've never SE a service thatintegrates the OM this well with thedatabase itself providing features thatare essential to most Services thanks toPR and post Chris for sponsoring checkit out today at soy. link prismad DB thetruth about serverless this is going tobe a complex topic before we go too farin and believe me we're going to go deepso if you're a person who knowsserverless well but doesn't necessarilyunderstand every detail of what's goodand bad about it stick around but weneed to do a very brief top leveloverview of what serverless is obviouslyserverless doesn't mean no servers whatit means is you're no longerprovisioning servers for yourapplication and for your code if youwere building things the traditional Idon't know lamp stack way which is thecool thing when I was a kid lamp stackstood for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP andwhen you were building with lamp stackyou would run all four of those thingson the same server you'd have a serverthat was running Linux had aache as thelike top level of orchestrating the HTTPrequests you had PHP which wouldactually do the work of generating thepages and you'd have MySQL which was thedatabase things would connect to to getthe data write it read you know what adatabase does hopefully then we had themean stack which was Expressangular and node and from that point theidea of everything running on one serverstarted to fade due to a specificcompany called AWS so the way thingsused to work is you would have a box sowe'll call this the old way and in theold way you'd have this box we'll saythis is just running Linux you wouldhave a top level in this box that wassomething likeApache then you would have another layeron the same server that wasPHP and then one last layer on the sameserver which was MySQL to rethink how Idrew this here let's make these alldifferent elements inside as I wasdescribing with the lamp stack think ofthis box as one server and it would runApache PHP and MySQL all here and if youwanted to swap out the PHP code youwould do that by ftping in and replacingthe files that this PHP code was callingbecause PHP is interpreted you can justswap the PHP files out for different PHPfiles on the Fly and you're fine butthen something interesting happened welltwo things the tech we were buildingwith changed slightly we're like wewould still maybe use Apache but usuallywe wouldn't even bother so the meanstack would beExpress and node you would still haveangular in here but the angular codewasn't running on this server theangular code was a script tag that waspart of the HTML that Express wouldresolve with and then you would loadthat script tag probably from somethinglike S3 to actually do the angular sideor the react side if you did M Stacklocally on yourdevice but something quickly started tohappen here which was that the toolingto swap out the code for the JavaScriptstuff was complex enough that justftping in and swapping it was not superreliable on top of that getting tobehave was annoying so a combination ofthis and this little company you guysmight have heard of called AWS I knowthey there's a small startup but uh theydid something interesting they brokethis up so instead of it being oneserver that has all these things in itthey have one server that's just theexpress and node code and a separateserver that is just the code andthis enabled a lot of cool things itmeant making changes to this didn't everrisk the Integrity of your database itmeant you could have multiple of thesein multiple different places if youneeded more boxes to handle more trafficyou can just run more of them and ifthey're all Conn to the same databaseit's fine and slowly we started doingthis with other databases it wasn't just even early on but the idea of adatabase platform being servers that areseparately running from your applicationcode was at a point in time a kind ofNew Concept the idea of connecting to adatabase on a different box somewhereelse as the main way of dealing withdatabase reads and writes on your APIwas weird people were not used to thatat time eventually this went so far thatwe started having microservices where wehave different Express node code basesentirely running on different boxes allusing some database as the source ofTruth a large inspiration for why we didthis was the ability to swap out thecode running on these boxes so this isrunning go code if this is runningpython code or something else and theability to swap it without restarting soto speak wasn't there like it is in PHPthe only way to properly swap out thiscode would be to spin up a new serverwith the new code start running trafficto that kill the traffic on the old oneand then kill this box and this type ofsetup in order to swap what was insideof the box that users were hitting gotmore and more complex on top of thatmore and more of the state that we usedto keep inside of this box like we wouldhere with my SQL started moving out soinstead of this being stateful in thisserver that we had running having abunch of data that would be lost if thethe server shut down we started makingit so at any point you just kill theserver and you wouldn't lose anythingbut at that point how much are webenefiting from having a long runningserver in the first place and whathappens if we have a huge traffic Spikeand we need more provisioning than thisserver has in it boy do we have asolution everyone'sfavorite kubernetes kubernetes wascreated to make it way easier to manageall of these different servers how manyof them there are what codee they're allrunningAuto scaling groups with ec2 was also abig part good call out from Ryan Ididn't know you knew the inaside thiswell good yeah ec2 was another paththere and then eventually ECS and eksall built around these kubernetesPrimitives the goal was all the samethough make it so you don't think asmuch about what specific code specificservers are running instead youconfigure the ability to spin up aserver and you can just spin them up andkill them whenever as long as yourdatabase is separate who cares becauseif you have one server or 100 servers ifthey're all connecting to the databasefine doesn't really matter how manyservers you have I've learned to justassume Ryan knows everything it'susually accurate yes but one of the thehighest honors I've ever had was helpinga thing click in Ryan's head it ismagical to take someone who does knoweverything like he does it actually helpthem understand a thing they happen tonot have an understanding of becausethey haven't done it it's it's humblingyeah Ryan a big part of why he knows somuch is he takes the time to learn itand he talks to the people who he knowsno better and is very willing to learnand be wrong but yes it feels like hejust knows everything anyways enough ofme explaining why Ryan carni is one ofthe smartest people in Tech back toanother smart thing in Techkubernetes I hope bringing up kubernetesand even typing that word out gave y'alla bit of trauma because one of thespecific things I have tried to pushwith my brand and my channel is takingthese things that work for very specifictypes of workloads in large companiesand making sure the average developerknows they shouldn't touch them thingslike 100 % code coverage things likekubernetes might make sense at specificlarge companies but for the majority ofmedium to small-sized companies or evenmedium to small siiz teams at bigcompanies they make a lot less sense doyou know who else realized thisAWS I think we have now contextualizedhow we got here first we had everythingon one box then we had the separation ofour application code and our databaselayer so that we could swap this outwithout losing our data then we realizedwe could actually run multi of these atall connecting to the same database andit didn't really matter which made itway easier to scale it made somethinglike node viable I should probably pointout that nod's concurrency model despitebeing great for iio bound things was notas good for heavy work so the ability tospin up multiple servers was very veryuseful for node specifically but toleave these here something started tobecome obvious at AWS why do we have tothink about how many of these serverswe're running and why are we runningthem all all of the time let's set up atheoretical scenario going to make aquick little diagram here let's say thisis number ofusers and the bottom will just say it'stime now let's say when our companystarted number of users is relativelysmall and we could comfortably fit it onjust one server awesome let's build somethresholds out here let's saythis line is the point at which oneserver can no longer handle the trafficthis would be twoservers this will bethree this would be four for a long timewe can get away with this but thingsdon't get start to get messy until youcross a threshold for the first time andnow we need two servers let's say weonly get those traffic spikes that needthat at very specific times like I don'tknow Black Friday caused our trafficSpike up a whole bunch now we're doingtoo much traffic to justify having thisone server here so we need two we couldset up an autoscaler to detect when thetraffic gets to a certain threshold sothat usually looks like is you pick athreshold we'll say here and when we seethat traffic number of users whatevermetrics we're tracking get to a specificpoint then we spin up another server soif we go past that point we have enoughservers to handle the traffic this alsomeans you have to write your code in away that can handle running in multipleplaces and makes no assumptions aboutmultiple users being connected to thesame box but if you make all of thoseassumptions and you build this in astateless way and you build in thesethresholds to detect when somethingshould scale up and down you can handlethis the issue is how long it takes forthat to spin up I'm going to copy pastethis because I want to have some morefun examples let's say instead of a slowramp up because it's a Black Fridaylet's say instead the ramp up is becauseTheo mentioned you on Twitter push youin a video let's say the ramp up lookslike that instead so it happens almostimmediately where in seconds we go froma small number of users to 3x or more wepass this threshold so we spin up thenext server but do we have even thecapacity to notice that we needed twoservers not one the servers take time tospin up and you need to have enoughservers to even know how much traffic iscoming in so if we broke our thresholdwe don't know how hard we broke thatthreshold necessarily so how manyservers do we spin up gets complex andas a result what I would see manycompanies do and to this day many stilldo I was guilty of this myself at Amazonwe would just provision up to ourtheoretical Peak so instead of runningone server or two servers we would justalways run three because the alternativeis some users get an error page or get ahanging connection because there was noserver to actually resolve their requestbecause the server that we had was overburdened and underprovision this stuffsucks I want to be real clear about thatdoing this is not fun if you're thetype of person that finds this fun coolawesome you're going to take a lot of mymoney in the process but this sucks andit's funny somebody said just don't useJS in chat because a lot of otherlanguages make this even worse railsblocks on iO so if you're doing adatabase check for one user the nextuser can't even start their request yetat least with JavaScript IO won't blockthe other things going on when I'mwaiting for the database to do somethingI can process other requests at the sametime you can build this yourself inother languages like you can build thistype of concurrent model for handlingnon-blocking IO separate from yourrequests in languages like go maybe youcan do it in Rust but at this point Ihope youall know how miserable it is todo concurrency and parallelism in Rusteven the like rust Community seems tohave mostly acknowledged this andwritten some awesome content on how hardis to parallel and multi-threading stuffcorrectly in these other languages butnon-blocking IO is a difficult problemand no rails has not solved it rails hasa cool thing called rack where you canspin up multiple threads on one box buteach of those threads can be blocked byIO that's just a fact so believe it ornot JavaScript is actually a pretty goodlanguage for running in environmentslike this when you consider the balanceof the code being much easier to work inand digest because you're not writingheavily async code the only code baseI've ever seen that is truly fullythreaded and is readable was alsowritten in Elixir because Elixir wasbuilt for these things but yeah if youthink rust is beautiful you haven'twritten enough concurrent in asyn Rustbecause that code you lose a lot of thebeauty really quickly anyways if wewanted to make this solution work greatthere's a few things we would need to doso here are like the bullet points ofhow to make this great and as again I'mtalking about the load balancingsolution so the things we'd have to doto make load balancing work wellare make it so servers can spin upfast because if I had to handle atraffic Spike I don't want to wait twominutes for a server to spin up I needthat ASAP so cold start times and thetime it takes to spin up a server ismuch more important we also have to makesure that we can detect the amount oftraffic more trivially make trafficpatterns easier to track and of coursewe need to make the code statelessso of courseAmazon worked hard to do all of thesethings they went out of their way tomake the spinning up of a new server asfast as possible to make it easier touse other tools to actually detect whattraffic levels look like so not having aserver capable of handling the trafficdoesn't prevent you from knowing howmuch traffic you're getting andencouraging us to move our state off ofour serverless into things like theirdatabase products their fun newserverless database Solutions stuff likethat but in order to make a load balancesolution work well these things wentfrom stuff that no one ever thoughtabout to high priorities I promise youup until recently nobody in the PHPworld was thinking about how long ittakes for your PHP code to initialize orto spin up a box from scratch and getPHP running on it these weren't thingspeople thought about because they ranPHP on a fixed number of servers thatwere always there so they didn't thinkabout how long it takes to start upbecause they don't start it up theystarted up 17 years ago and haven'ttouched it since so these aren't thingsthat most of these devs thought aboutbut in order to handle these types oftraffic patterns and these behaviors ADWhas had to think about these things andI think those who are tuned in enoughare going to see what happened here theyaccidentally inventedserverless serverless happened naturallywhen the efforts were put in to do allof these things so that load balancedServices could spin up faster because ifyou need to go from one server to twoservers to three servers you need to beable to handle the fact that there'sdifferent state on those differentservers you need to handle the fact thatthese need to spin up almost immediatelyyou need a way to know how much trafficis there so you know how many servers tospin up so the obvious question that ledhere is what if it wasautomatic this is why serverless existsthe process of automating load balancingalmost naturally comes to the conclusionof rebuilding Lambda and the reasonserverless works this way is becauseit's where you naturally end up when youtry to optimize these problems so toactually explain what serverless isbecause again there's a server is we'veabstracted a bit further so if we goback here to the distributed mean stackexample where we have servers 1 two andthree and all these servers are runningExpress in node and we have ourdatabase I'm going to move thisseparately because I want to separatethese into a clearset of things a quick way to diagramthings differently from what I wasshowing before is if we set this up asstateful on one side and stateless onthe other because this code needs to beable to run and die and handle all ofthose cases so we have to offload thestate over here the state could be in State could be in redus the statecould be in a lot of different placesbut when these servers need State theyhave to get it from somewhere elseinstead because we need to be able tokill this server at any time or spin upanother next to it and not lose track ofyour user information and stuff likethat and when you separate things thisway the next step almost becomes obviousI'm going to quickly change this to beyour express code make this a bit biggerso it's clearer because this server isrunning your express code and node whichis what the code is being executed on sonow if it turns out you need moretraffic you have to spin up a wholeanother one of these boxes and these boxare running Linux so we have to wait forLinux to boot so now we have an emptybox with just Linux then once that'sbooted we spin up node we have to loadin node all of its dependencieseverything else and then we load in yourexpress code and now the server onceit's processed that code Jed it launchedit and got it running now after howevermany seconds if not minutes that alltook oh and by the way you have to forma database connection too notice toconnect to your database to be able todo things once all of that work is donenow this server could start respondingto requests what if we moved the expresscode though what if all of these serverswere already running but without yourcode in them you could do this yourselfas I showed before you can just spin upa server for all the different thingsthat you might be doing and all of theconcurrency that you might hit all theuser counts you might reach you can spinup the right number of servers for thatbut it' be hella expensive but if yourAmazon size spinning up that manyservers and just keeping them aroundisn't as big of a deal especially if youare dealing with the traffic of likehalf of the web because if one websiteis spiking in traffic that means otherwebsites aren't so if you have all ofthese servers that are already runningand you're able to temporarily sharethese with people so that effectivelyit's a different layer of the sameinstruction where when you're renting aserver through ec2 they're not going toa server rack plug pluging in a new boxthat they just bought for you andassigning it to you they already have abunch of these machines spun up ready togo they're just giving you a virtuallayer in one of them so what they'vedone since and what surus actually is isthey've abstracted it one step highernow they're not just running a serverwaiting for your code to come take overand run it indefinitely now they haveall of these servers idling waiting fora payload the payload could be a Dockerimage but generally they don't recommendthat recommend using their images so youcan use their pre-provision serversbecause now when a user makes a requestall they have to do is move your code inhandle the request and then move it outthat's what server list enables it's notthat there aren't servers is that youdon't own them the same way in theprevious model all of these boxes arethings you could see in your AWSdatabase you had a server that was myserver one my server 2 my server 3 thesewere yours and they stayed around untilyou told them to go away the whatserverless means isn't there are no moreservers it means the part of what youown no longer includes the actualservers because the server is onlyrunning when a request is being made soit could be an event triggered throughsqs or like you uploaded a file on S3which triggered a Lambda there's a lotof different reasons that one of thesethings might spin up but by default theyare not there and your code is justsitting in S3 waiting for one of theseservers to receive a request so that itcan load in that code and start toexecute now we're try to get the goodquestions does serverless mean thedependencies get installed for everycall effectively yes oh AJ's heregood stuff please correct me if I sayanything stupid I'm trying to to do avery dumbed down explanation of howthese things work but if I say somethingthat's like outright egregiouslyincorrect you know what you're talkingabout please correct me doing greatstuff are awesome that's like theserverless God says I'm doing great coolwe're doing good so far boys this isactually a really good question doesserverless mean the dependencies getinstalled for every call for now I'mgoing to say yes I'm going to describeit and then I'll show you how it's notfully true but for starts yes if I havea service that has a low number ofrequests let's say one a minute or sothe request comes in AWS sees therequest and says oh this request is tothis URL which means it needs this codeto run so to be very clear not only doyou have to spin up all the dependenciesfrom your code base so any node modulesyou have any complex stuff there notonly is that all to get included youalso have to form any additionalconnections so if Express is using an OMin your JavaScript code that then has toform a connection to your database toreddis to whatever else and the formingof those connections can take timebecause again back in the old serverfull days where everything was on thesame box they didn't care how long ittook for PHP to connect to my SQLbecause it's already connected who caressuddenly we have to care a lot morebecause that is now a blocking thingthat keeps your code from executing soif it was a 5-second connection timethat you only ever had once inserverless all of a sudden it'shappening hundreds if not thousands oftimes a day depending on the servicesthat you're building this also meantthat things like balancing how youconnected to your database mattered morecuz like a default postgress deploymenton Heroku had a maximum number ofconnectionof 10 10 connections could be madebecause again they were assuming you hadone to 10 servers that were alwaysconnected but if I have 15 users I mighthave 15 connections and now the old waywe connected to databases startedfalling apart and that's why we startedseeing things like PG bouncer PG Poolerand all of these tools to abstract andbuild a way to hold connections so theycould be shared across differentdeployments but as I mentioned before wewere building all these things anywaysin order to make server backed loadbalancing work as well because it wouldreally suck if the 11th server shows upand all of a sudden your database can'tbe connected to because it had a limitof 10 connections we had to solve theseproblems but as we went further andfurther with those Solutions we madethis way more viable and now the termserverless database despite soundingkind of dumb because it is kind of dumbwhat it actually means is the serverthat your database is running on isprepared to handle an absurd number ofparallel connections because if you have1500 users you might have, 1500connections to your database even ifyou're not reading and writing too muchdata from it so this just soundsterrible right like why would we do thiswell there's one piece that makes it wayless bad than it sounds when this coderesponds this box doesn't immediatelydie it sticks around for a little bit itholds the connection that you made andif another request comes in fast enoughit will handle that for you which meansyou don't have to pay the cost of movingthis code over you don't have to pay thecost of jitting the code getting itrunning you have to pay the cost ofconnecting to your database and allthose things it's already been paid itjust sticks around for the next requestand if you have enough users and enoughrelative traffic the number of timesyou're eating cold starts goes downquite a bit but if you have a trafficSpike if you have a traffic Decline andthen it goes back to normal or you justhave like an event where a lot of peopleare saturating existing lambdas and thenone person makes an additional requestpast your current provisioning you willeat a cold start so we needed to reducethe cost of those as much as we couldand we have the cost of spinning up yourdatabase connections the cost of insingthe JavaScript code the cost of a lot ofthese things has gone down significantlyand now you can run things serverlessand get surprisingly great performanceif architected correctly now that wehave broken all of this down I thinkwe're finally ready to get to the thingI actually want to talk about for thisvideo which isn't how serverless worksor even how we got here it's the titleup here the truth about serverless wetalk about the truth we talk about thefacts that we've just establishedfirst serverlessrequires fast startup timestwoserverless scales tozero well three serverlessrequiresstateless design of your applicationcode and fourserverless costs more money than runninga server for the same amount of timethat's a cool call out fromAJ pretty true too AWS want say itpublicly but I wrote a blog post withcode which proves that they're doingsome predictive autoscaling pretty neatI call it proactive initializationthat's really cool a% cold starts werepre-warmed but your mileage may be veryyinteresting so even cold starts might bepre-warmed because Amazon is trying todetect those things very interestingyeah anything here that is egregious AJI think this is a fair set of points tocall out I'm going to do a a littlething up here fun potentialtangents that I'm successfully avoidingwe'll see how long I'm able tosuccessfully avoid these for one is howCloudflare uses V8 to avoid cold starts oneis versel caching bikcode one is HTTP connection methods fordatabases there's a lot of these thingsI want to touch on but we have more totalk about so it is relatively agreeduponthat these are things that you have tounderstand and deal with if you'rebuilding in a serverless mindsetspeaking of building in a serverlessmindset AJ has been helping us out a tonthroughout this if I say anything and hedisagrees and it's about AWS orserverless anything I am wrong he isright listen to him great stuff alsostreams on Twitch benchmarking a lot ofthese different things so if you'recurious to see what this actually lookslike to do AJ's a really fun follow andI have absolutely used his threads hiscontent and his streams to keep up onthese things I can't believe I wasn'tfollowing him that was pathetic on mypartanyways I want to Riff on these thingsbecause I have a real spicy take and thespicy take is the thing that we're I'mactually filming this for here's myspicy take the requirements to build ina serverless manner make you writebetter software and here's where we getto get spicy the secret piece that I'mgoing to try and conv you guysthroughout serverless is the biggest winfor functional programming quitepossibly of all time functionalprogramming is the concept that youbuild a pipeline of code and functionsand when given an input it will alwaysgenerate the same output pure functionsfunctional programming are not the mostpopular thing in the world I'm not goingto sit here and pretend everyone'swriting everything functionallyfunctional programming isn't just athing that we talk about because we'reevil and we hate o or whatever it makesreasoning about your application logiccomically simpler this one of those fewplaces where I think I in the unittesting and testing World get alongquite well because if your functions arewritten in a pure way where the sameinput will always generate the sameoutput it is really easy to test it isreally easy to debug it is really easyto reason about and some of the mostcomplex code bases that I have worked inwere made significantly simpler by usingpatterns like this like it was easier toread our insane concurrent pipelines fordealing with video inest for the contentteam I was on at twitch because it waswritten in elixir with good Primitivesthen it is to read and reason about Idon't know a websocket server written inRust if your code has clearer inputs andoutputs and those pieces the functionscan be composed in a way that is logicalyour software will be better and easierto maintain I have a few pieces ofcontent where I talk about this there'sa classic video one of my favorite techvideosever want to find theoriginal yo is this Brian will video Ihave a video on my channel of mereacting to it object orientedprogramming is bad is so good it's sucha good video it got me into codingYouTube for real when I was younger andI I probably would not be a YouTuber ifit wasn't for this and it wasn't forBrian unbelievable piece of content Iwould argue this is like a must-watchfor all developers not even because o isterrible just to give you theperspective of how we got there and whyother methodologies of programming aregood so as I was saying with serverlessone of the fun things of buildingserverless is that your state has to beseparated you have to have your statesomewhere else and when you're executinga serverless function let's say I havean API that you hit to get your userprofile data so you're hitting this APIyou have a cookie on your headers thatI'm using to know who you are and I'mfetching data from database to give youyour profile the server cannot containthethat comes from the request it is passedto it and it cannot contain the databasebecause that's running somewhere else sowhen you write this code and this pipeso to speak is being hit it gets twoinputs the first input is the requestthe second input is the databaseconnection so to speak and through thosetwo pieces we are now able actuallytechnically speaking the only input onthe top level function is the request sothis function takes the request it seesthat this request is for the get userprofile endpointso it grabs the database connection andit passes the request in the databaseconnection to another function thatfunction checks the request to figureout who this user is once it hasauthenticated you and knows you're youit then makes a call to the database toget the user's profile info and then itsends that down to the user none of thatstate lives on that server it doesn'tmatter if we have one server doing that100 servers doing it or 100, serversdoing it as long as the database canhandle the concurrent connections you'regood but if that state is distributedall over the place or it's attached torandom objects you need to update theserver and you don't know what's goingto happen to that connection all ofthose things it gets chaotic quick andmost of the hardest problems I've had todebug in software have come from thefact that state is being put in thewrong places I'm going to drop one morehot take this is also where the HTM Xfolks and I agree the fewer places yourstate lives the better and ideally yourstate doesn't live in places it doesn'thave to like business logic like clientside logic if you can move all of thestatefrom your servers away from the clientand all the client gets HTML it makesreasoning about the Cent andrelationship with the serversignificantly easier if you can move allthe state out of your serers side logicand endpoints and have the logic in thecomplexity of the code be there and thestate is something that it's pulling inexternally or receiving through arequest reasoning through what happenswhen and how becomes significantlyeasier it's so cool and as a functionalprogramming nerd it has gotten meexcited about buildingand back at code again because theactual code I'm writing is so simple andall the other things we used to have tothink about like how is this deployingwhat's the deploy script how manyservers do I have what is the size ofthe server how many virtual CPUs howmuch RAM do I have all those things Ihad to start worrying about that againrecently because I'm spinning up somelall stuff on the side I forgot howannoying it is to play The Guessing Gameto make sure you've provisioned thingscorrectly it is not fun and it's justanother one of those things that'staking up room in your head like wheredoes this state live or how many coresdo I have on the server or how manyrequests can this handle all of thesethings are things that have been wastingtime in my brain and when you are forcedto not be able to have those things Iactually find that the code I'm writingand the amount of my brain that I'musing is simpler it's easier to reasonabout these things I have been verysurprised that these requirements aren'tflaws they aren't things I have to worryabout constantly these are things thatmake my code better there are obviouslytimes where I can't do these things likeif I have to have state like for theinjest server for upload thing it needsto know the current set of chunks it hasand where they are going and that isephemeral state but it has to live onthe server we are putting some of it inredus so that if a server diesimmediately like we can recover but thenature of how it's holding connectionsis such that it should be on a server soit is but if you can build this way Iwould go as far as say you probablyshould because it makes reasoning aboutthese things homic simpler but I have toRiff on two additional pieces here Ithink the first chunk of what we talkedabout helps explain why the requirementfor fast startup times makes sense andwhy it's actually good because it makeseverything from load balancing toserverless better I think I did a goodjob here with point two which isserverless requires stateless design ofyour application code just described whynot only is that reasonable but it'sactually kind of good and can make yourcode significantly better and easier toreason about but now RI on these nexttwo scale to zero and it costs tooo muchlet's have a conversation about scale tozero this is a thing I've actuallychanged my mind on a little bit I'mgoing to tell this story of how I cameto these conclusions by not talkingabout serverless we're going to talkabout databases talk about two companiesPlanet scale and turo these twocompanies might seem pretty similar onthe outside they're both serverlessdatabase providers that are trying tomake it easier for full stack devs todeploy things and database work butthere are some key differences obviouslyPlanet scale is MySQL plus vest it isfocused on massive throughput this bitsmaller on massive amounts of data butthe most important thing is it requiresservers to run and that means it'sexpensive for them to run and I stilllove Planet scale we're still using itfor upload thing and I cannot imaginebuilding upload thing without it turoit's quite a bit different it's SQLlight technically it's lib SQL becausethey forked sqlite because gettingchanges merg into sqlite isimpossible but I honestly see lib SQLbecoming the standard long term it's ina really good State simple to adoptmulti-tenant multitenant in this casemeans that you can spin up differentdatabases for different customersbecause realistically speaking are youever trying to join data from differentusers tables like if I have twocustomers with upload thing that areuploading files to different places indifferent regions what is the likelihoodI have to fire a query that is joiningthose two different customers it'seffectively zero and if you can separatelike different orgs different customersdifferent applications to differentfull-on databases it can make managingthose databases way easier and turoreally focus on doing things like thatwhere Planet scale they're using vitessto Shard so you have one massivedatabase that is broken up based ondifferent keys in the database so maybethey have different like groups of datain the database sharded based on theuser ID they're attached to pretty coolbut very different approaches to similarproblems they are both trying to beserverless friendly databases though onemore detail on turo side data stored inS3 since it's based on sqlite and as youhopefully know sqlite is just storing toa file by default turo just stores thosefiles in S3 or some random Object Storeand if your database isn't getting a lotof traffic and then a user goes to yourservice and now that database has to behit similar to what we were describingbefore with serverless they just pullyour database from S3 resolve therequest see if more come through for abit if they don't they just put it backin S3 and then it comes out again whenthe requests are being made that meansinsanely cheap to run since Planet scalehas a server or multiable for each oftheir databases doesn't matter how manyusers you have each one requiresmultiple servers and that's expensiveand that's why Planet skill ultimatelyhad to kill their free tier whereas turois one of the most generous free tiersI've ever seen in my lifethe free tier gives you 500 databases 9gigs of total storage 1 billion rowreads and unlimited embedded replicasthat's insane for a free tier but whenyou understand the pricing model itmakes makes a lot more sense becausetheir pricing isn't based on how manydatabases you have costing themsignificantly more money because they'reall running servers it's based on thefact that they're just storing that datain S3 this also why when I'm working onsmaller projects now and therequirements for raw amounts of data arelower than something like upload thingwith Millions if not tens of millions offiles terso is a really good choice andthat's why I use turo for pick thing yesI'm actually shipping too and productionnow and it's been pretty good experienceoverall so why am I bringing all of thisup this is the planet scale pricing pageone of the things that I really likeabout planet scale is their concept ofbranches a branch is a copy of yourdatabases schema that is none of thedata it's just the same schema so youcan use that in Dev in staging whateverto make changes to the databases schemalike add new rows add new tables deletethings create new indexes whatever oncethat has been reviewed and people agreeon it you can then do what's called adeploy request similar to a poll requeston GitHub to request that these schemeof changes get added to the productionschema but those development brancheshave to run actual servers because againPlanet scale is running real MySQL vtest servers which means each of thesebranches costs them pretty close thesame amount of money that the actualdatabase cost them which is why theyhave to bill hourly based on thosebranches previously you'd pay for afixed number of branches but that gotmiserable quick like our bills for justbranches were pretty rough especiallywhen we tried to automate the creationof staging environment stuff it got badso they changed the billing to be basedon hours of usage so a month says 30days 24 hours 720 hours in the month asthey say that's two number the hours ofthe month so you can built in into theirmain tier have two branches open thewhole month but if you need a thirdbranch you have a third developerworking on things you have to pay moneyfor that if you don't remember to sleepthese or kill an old one when you'redone with it you have to pay for thatand it's not that just nickel and dimingyou to squeeze every penny out itactually costs the money I'm not sittinghere trying to demonized Planet scaleit's the thing that we're using for areason it's a phenomenal service andit's worth every cent but these types offeatures cost them a lot of money to runand the reason they built this featureis to streamline the process ofdeploying your changes so that it feelsmore similar to what we're used to withtools like GitHub and versel and allthese other awesome things in theecosystem turo gives zero I don'tthink they mention they mentionbranching in here yeah branching isn'tlike how many it's just yes there is noconcept of branch hours or number ofbranches or any of these things becauseagain it doesn't cost the money it'sfunny to look at to see yes where the onplanet scale it's like complex math youhave to do it's just yesyeah so this is where my brain startedto flip cuz previously especially ifchatting with Planet scale and Sam thereI still love Sam we would talksome on scale to zero because thepeople who push really hard for scale tozero as like a reason to adopt a servicethey're doing that because they have nousers and they want their service withzero users to cost Z and they want theirservice that theoretically might havethousands of users someday to cost areasonable amount of money one trafficgoes down they don't want to payanything and when you're like me I don'teven want to see how many gabos I haveright now 192 so I have 192 projects andI actually go through and delete thempretty regularly so that's a lot and ifI have all of those different projectsvery few of them are getting actualtraffic and if I'm paying for a $5 VPSfor each of those that's not a cheapmonthly bill and now imagine each ofthose has multiple poll requests thathave preview environments if each ofthose has let's say average five openPRS all of which have a previewenvironment and they all have $5 a monthserver for each of those which isgenerous cuz theoretically theproduction version probably needs more192 Time 5 po request time $5 that's$4,800 a month for just my GitHub reposand then I was starting to play withturo more and thinking more about theircost model and realized the magic ofscale to zero has nothing to do withhaving zero users on your productionenvironments scale to zero doesn'tmatter for production and that is whathas flipped my brain realizing that thisisn't a feature that allows for youpeople with zero users to have a goodtime like yes it does that cool thebenefit of scale to zero is you don'thave to worry about things in yourdevelopment environment your stagingenvironment and all the other thingscosting you money when they have nousers if you're running a $3,000 a monthgigantic server to handle insane amountsof traffic and you're working on thingsin Dev you either run it on a smallerserver so you're no longer replicatingthe actual production environment oryou're doubling your costs for everysingle instance of a developerenvironment and I've seen companiesdoing crazy stuff to make that viablenow to showcase the company I said Iwouldn't talk about too much this is mypersonal versell account notice that itis Hobby tier I am not paying on mypersonal versell account because I don'tneed to the things that get enoughtraffic are on my business account butfor my personal hobby tier is fine butwhat I care about here has very littleto do with the number of apps I havewhich by the way I have a lot of appsdeployed I the show more button showmore again yeah I have a lot of appsdeployed on a free tier and it's finebut even more fun if I go to somethingthat had branches on it this actually bea fine one T3 Astro you go todeployments these are all thedeployments for different PO requeststhat I did two plus years ago ready forthe real magic I just clicked the linkfor a deploy from two years ago and itworked fine almost immediately instethis might have had no users itobjectively had no users nobody ischecking a preview build of myapplication from 2 years ago this typeof workflow is only viable in serverlessenvironments and it's the secret winthat scale to zero actually provides ifthe cost of your service having zerousers is that close to zero you can nowdo things that you would never otherwisebe able to do we saw the branching modelon planet scale it's cool they got itworking but it takes so long to spin upa branch and it cost you money unlessyou manually sleep it and it cost youmoney anyways because s we spun up withsomething like turo just go spin up moredatabases who cares spinning up a newone is you just click a button it'sthere immediately because it's justmaking a new sqlite file you have toworry about those things and thatenables workflows ideas and things thatjust aren't possible otherwise youcannot have a preview environmentexperience this good without somethinglike serverless because because youcan't leave this code running you can'tleave all of these PO requests on a onmy personal site on my free tier verselaccount you can't have these hundreds ofpreviews up and ready to go where I canclick any of these links and it willimmediately resolve the page still thismy old version of my website that is socool and up until recently versell wouldjust indefinitely keep all of thesedeployments available forever nowthere's an option where they'llautomatically kill them in 60 days but Idon't care why should I all it's doingis grabbing the right code from S3that's it's been sitting on for yearsnow it's not like the code is Big it'slike a few megabytes of but itcan pull those into the Lambda spin itup immediately and it costs themeffectively nothing so if I have anoutage and I'm trying to figure out whenthe thing broke I can just scrollthrough or I can hit filter productionhere's every production deployment I'veever had on my personal site I haven'tdone one for over a year I need to writemore blog posts clearly and these areavailable so if I have a bug and I'mcurious when did it break click does itwork here oh cool it works here guess itwas an older one this is not possiblewith servers unless you massively overprovision build your own workflow fordynamically loading in and out code anddealing with the latency necessary therelike I've seen people spin up thingslike this with stuff like fly iio it'sgoing to be 5 to 10 seconds minimum whenyou click the link till it finishesspinning up the server and actuallyshows you the content which makesemergencies suck also if I want toswitch to the old version here's how Ido it click oh sorry hobby customcustomers can't instant roll back but ifI was on a paid account one click alltraffic is going to the old version butthe traffic isn't being redirectedwhat's actually happening is when a usershows up it just resolves different codeinstead that's magical and these typesof workflows are only possible becausethe production environment who caresabout the scale of this one but all ofthese other environments every singleold production environment I've ever hadthese are all currently benefiting fromscaling to zero because if they didn'tscale to zero they would have to beterminated they couldn't stay there thisis totally true scale to zero is usefulif your product is seasonal or even justactive a bit during the day and then notbut for Production Services which areinteracting with other automatedServices scale to zero is kind ofpointless you can save money usingprovisioned mode for Lambda but it'sstill expensive compared to even fargateyeah I agree and honestly buildingthings in a way where serverless is allof the stuff going on in the developerworld when you're writing the codeyou're working on things in developmentwhatever else awesome you use sist forall that and then if you want to minmaxthe cost verticals for the actualdeployed version make the productionversion fargate that is a totally fineacceptable path I would actually findthat pretty cool because againserverless and stateless code can be runjust fine in a server code that'sexpecting a server full runtime is bothharder to debug and can't just be throwninto a serverless environment and beexpected to work I like coolify a lotI've been chat with the coolify dev abit more now too but I want to be veryclear coolify help streamline a lot ofthese things and it's one of the fewways to to replicate these workflows ina server nobody has this withoutserverless you can't just have everysingle instance ever deployed of yourapplication with a oneclick swap overthat doesn't happen otherwise shouldprobably clarify what coolify is forthose who don't know coolify isself-hosting or superpowers it's aeither you pay them to use their cloudor you self host because it's all opensource and you deploy coolify actuallyI'll see if I can find my um my coolifydashboard cool just for proof that I'mactually using coolify I'll dark muchyou all don't get too mad at me you canconnect the GitHub project configurethings and get it running as many Dockerimages in an existing server so kifiruns on a dedicated VPS and then youspin up little Docker images fordifferent things so here I have my Layeldeployment and I have my postgress sothese are separate Docker images thattalk to each other so I'm able to toreplicate the stateless workflow heresome amount but these still need to beprovisioned thankfully with PHP you cankind of just hot swap the code itdoesn't give a so you can get alittle closer with PHP but otherlanguages have startup times andexpectations you can't just hot swapthose and is cool as cool if I is andtrust me it's pretty cool it does notcome close to the power of oneclickredeploys instantaneously redeployinghaving every single GitHub PR get apreview environment link that is thereforever so if I go and I look at an oldPR and I want to see how it works I canclick the link and it works noone else does these things this way noother method I should say doing thiswith servers isn't really possibleunless you're spending a ton of moneyand as Yash just said in chat I knowsomeone whose company racks up $100,000a year in bills on their QA and Devenvirment I have personally racked upmore than that at Amazon and twitch it'snot even that hard to do AJ gave me afantastic transition Point here to gofrom3 to4 I hope I have properlyestablished here that the benefit ofscale to zero isn't that if you havezero users things are cool it's that youcan have an infinite number ofdeployments and not think about itbecause who cares it's just data sittingin S3 and it gets loaded when you makethe request when you start building inthis way you get to do so you just getsuperpowers that you wouldn't otherwisehave that are magical it's similar topoint at my favorite functional basedthing react the magic of oh I can justreuse that component it's like ohthat fundamentally changes How I buildsoftware and that's how I felt when Iwas doing this I just didn't realizethat scale to zero is the the reasonthat these things can work and are socool like I intuitively knew it and ifyou ask meble to figure it out but itwas using turo that made it click for methe reason turo can be so generous withthings like branching the number ofdatabases and all of that is because thedatabases are stored in S3 and they justhave a server running sqlite pullingfrom S3 reading or writing or whateverand then updating S3 accordingly it's socool and it's basically the exact samemodel as how how Lambda works and howversell works and how netlify works andarguably how cloudflare works and it isso hard for me to not go down the cloudflare V8 tangent please in the commentstell me you want to hear this so I canjustify filming this video because Idon't think people care but if you canconvince me I would love to film thisit'd be very fun for me but now we needto talk about the final Point hereserverless costs more money than runninga server for the same amount of time ifyou were to price out how expensive itis to run a 5 VPS and look at how muchcompute you got it's like oh that's fivebucks a month and I get all of thiscompute whereas doing things serverlessis no longer build on how many serversyou have and gigabyte hours are ameasurement of how many gigs of RAM arebeing used in explaining gigabyte hoursis really hard AJ how do you do it howdo you break down gbh in a way forLayman to understand because it's stupid metric Gabriel it's likegigabytes per second but for hoursgodamn it I haven't had a question hurtme this deeply in a long time this mightmake me do an additionaltangent okay I have one more tangentthat has come to mind this one I mightactually do while recording this fortears ofabstraction baremetalec2 ECSLambda that'll be an annoying one heyjust writing a Blog he also probably isdoing his job and having a life this isactually B basically how I was going todescribe it a function allocated 1 GBthat runs for 1 second is considered tohave consumed 1 GB second so if you havea Lambda that has 1 gig of RAM and itruns for 1 second you just ran 1Gigabyte second this is annoying becausethe amount of CPUs and other things thatexist in that are additional costvectors but the gigabyte second metricis how most of your serverless billingis being measured so let's say I'veconfigured my service to use 4 GB of RAMon a Lambda it gets 100 requests perhour in each request takes 1second then every hour I'd be using 400gigabyte seconds take the number ofseconds per request times the number ofrequests times the number of gigabytesand when you combine all those numberstogether that's your usage so let's bumpthis let's do a th requests per hourmaintain the 1 second request time thiswould equal out to 4,000 gabyt per hourso every hour we're using 4,000 gigabyteseconds gbtimes s to be clear thank youfor correcting that chat and that wouldbe 2, 880,000GBS per month so let's go look at thepricing here we're going to literallyskip everything else we'll look at the 4Gig why is it showing prices per 1millisecond that is so annoyingso here's the 4 gigs of RAM we'll timesthis by a th so that we have actualseconds here's the gab per second costso if we go back here 4 GBservers GBS cost equals that tiny numberso if we grab the 2, 880,000 and wemultiply it by thisnumber that would cost you $192 a monthso the total costhere 192bucks and when you look at that youthink aboutit ow especially when you compare to anequivalent VPS ec2pricing if we look at an ec2 instance Iwish they would stop showing the hourlyrate we'll grab a t4gmedium times 6 60 * 24 * that can't beright that's hourly rightd for an equivalent 4 G Ram serverrunning for that whole month it'd be 24bucks a month so if you would just run aserver that whole time instead it wouldhave been hilariously cheaper it's notthe $5 a month VPS clearly there's beensome inflation but for 25 bucks a monthyou could just run this server and notpay that absurd amount of money butthere's a lot of catches here that Iwant to bring in first one is herethousand requests per hour there arevery very few services that have a flatlevel of requests like this if there arethere're like cron jobs or ingest thingspulling off of a queue stuff like thatin reality most Services havetraffic that looks a lot like this wherethe amount of traffic goes up and downconstantly and depending on how heavythose spikes are for you the cost ofspinning up enough servers to run duringthose Peaks quite possibly very high andthe cost that matters isn't if we havean exact fixed rate of traffic what'scheaper servers or serverless thequestion is how big is the gap betweenyour lows and your highs in yourtraffic because this Gap suck to dealwith the space between these points isthe magic of serverless we don't have tocare how high or how low our traffic isat any given time our cost will Scalebased on it and if we have priced outour service so that the amount of moneya given user's request costs us is areasonable amount then we can just kindof turn our brains off because the thepainful reality when you're not buildingthis way let's say you're we this is the4 G gab server that cost 25 bucks amonth if you are here and that is yourPeak you're paying the 24 amonth the moment you go there you justdoubled your costs and the Gap from hereto here having a 2X in your cost sucksand if you're ever going to worry aboutthese things and your auto scaling istoo slow and you end up losing trafficas a result of a user having a pagetimeout because the server didn'trespond fast enough or spin up a newserver fast enough those costs can getbad both the like loss of the customercost but also the over-provisioning sowe go back to thisbreakdown and we look at a th requestsper hour assuming each one takes onesecond oh turns out I did a lot of mymath really bad here don't know whynobody corrected me it's only 720,000gigabyte seconds so if you're leaving arude comment right now because of howbig that cost was I hope you doublechecked my math before doing thatbecause otherwise you would look reallyfoolishcool all of a sudden this starts to lookmore reasonable Because the actual costhere would be 48bucks remember that VPS we just lookedat I let track of it you guys got theidea though it was about 24 bucks amonth for the 4 gab server handling allthis traffic through lambdas would betwice the price is that horrible andterrifying me but again go back to mychart the moment you cross thisthreshold either a user has to wait forthe new server to spin up or you decidedto over provision so you're just payingfor the two servers instead anyways butnow let's playwith the way that these numbers aredistributed because I set a th000requests per second that is 720,000requests over the month we could saythat those are happening in even amountthroughout the day but let's change it alittle bit let'ssay for our theoretical alternative weonly get 500 requests per daywe'll do the math so 29 days 500requests that's 14,500 requests for 29days of the year but then one day orI'll say one hour sees a hugeSpike and we'll say that spike is thegap there so it was 720,000 minus 1450so we'll say that this Spike I'll evengo lower we'll say to 600,000 requestso one hour on one day gets this massiveSpike to 600,000 requests we're used togetting 500 a day oh was my current mathright because I did the four gig um lookat the math I just did oh yeah I didforet the times four I should plan thesethings out more before I do them live Ionce againrecant because it was 4gigs that'll be the number but I amgoing to change something for the sakeof being realistic we're GNA make it onegig of RAM nowbecause realistically speaking a serverhandling all of your requests with 4gigs of RAM is comparable to a serverhandling individual requests with onegig of RAM it's probably overprovisioned to have one gig of ram inthose so I am switching that back we'reassuming one gig of RAM here so it is aslightly less powerful server but ifeach user's requests are using four gigsof RAM you can't handle concurrentrequest anyways so cool my math wasright but yeahanyways so if we have our 1 gig of RAM500 requests per day usually but thenthis one hour it spikes at 600,000 goodluck handling that yeah and here's wherethings start to get fun if you arebuilding this with servers and you needto be prepared to handle that massive ofa spike your options are quitelimited if yourtraffic usually lives down here and mostdays it hangs out in thisrange but then for just a briefmoment it does that do you know howmiserable it is to provision for thisbecause even if your load balancer codeis incredible if the spike is aggressiveenough you can't load balance it out soyour options are now provision based onthis potential Spike so you have yourservers provisioned way more heavily butif you just went viral and your serverswere not set up to handle that asignificant percentage of your initialusers are going to hit a dead pagebecause it cannot resolve and in orderto make it so that that can resolve inorder to handle that Spike you have toaccount for that by over specking yourserver by like600x and that's the issue is how yourtraffic is distributed fundamentallychanges the way in which these costsoperate for you of course a loadbalancer can handle that how do youthink AWS does it do you think a loadbalancer makes new servers when Amazonruns out of servers Amazon solves thisproblem by being the mostover-provisioned company of all timeAmazon servers are already therethey already bought them they're sittingthere so yes if you want to eat a bunchof cost like Amazon does you canmassively over-provision too but one ofthe cool things about Amazon is thatthey have so many people buying so manyservers that it effectively balances outbecause if my service is having amassive Spike there's a bunch of otherservices that aren't and as such theycan justify buying a much larger amountof servers because they can handleeveryone's spikes for them it's pricedinto their model but if you're not Amazon you should not be runninga massive over-provision set of serversfor those single spikes it just doesn'tmake sense woring about a theoreticalrandom viral event seems insane look atlevels traffic after massive advertisingspikes uh everything I've ever worked onhas random 5x plus spikes literallyeverything I've ever worked on in my life be it upload thing havingsomeone randomly decide they want tomove all their files over and moving amillion files in an hour be it twitchchat where Drake shows up in ninjastream and we go from I don't know500,000 messages a second to like 15million a second that's just realproduction workflows I would go as faras to say if your stance is well noteveryone goes viral you don't work onreal production workflows thisis expected that was viewers but oneviewer can send a shitload ofmessages yes levels has a person whosefull-time job is managing the loadbalancing for his servers and as peopleare pointing out he also over Provisionsmassively if your traffic can havemultiplicative changes where it can befive times higher for an amount of timeand the speed at which it goes from thelow traffic to the high traffic is fastand these are the things that I wastrying to figure out how to word it isstarting to come to me there are certaincharacteristics that make serverless thecheaper and better option the big twoare gap between high and lows fortraffic velocity of change between highand low traffic because if we have thistraffic Spike here and instead of itgoing straight up it does that where itgradually increases oh Lo balanc are canhandle thatfine says generally High variance I likethat phrasing if the variance of yourtraffic going up and down is high andthe speed that it goes up and down ishigh too serverless makes a lot of senseand there's a reason Amazon uses Lambdain serverless as heavily as they do it'sthe right primitive when your trafficcan spike in these random ways it is sopowerful and a thing I think people failto understand when they say how do youthink Amazon does it is that Amazon'sservices are largely built based on whatthey needed internally as I walkedthrough at the beginning of this verylong video they found themselves onserverless in a pretty logical path wewent from here the old way to separatingout our database so that we could scaleour application code independently torealizing we could move the applicationcode out of the application boxes but togo back here it's hard to maketheoreticals for like how much resourceswould 600,000 requests in an hour takeso let's use some real numbers base campdid 5250 requests per second 500 coresat Max load that's three boxes eachrunning a Z5 192 core AMD chip for 5,250requests per second okay so let's figureout what that would cost I'll evenhetner it not many real productionenvironments are using hetner becauseyou never know when they're going torandomly shut your down is therelike a header pricing page cool we doAMD you can only do the 48 core modelsforthis 48 cores 96 threads he said he needhow many cores 500 cores at Max load soI'll even I I'll round down for himwe'll say you need 10 ofthese time 12 it's 28 grand a yearnot looking good so far but €2360 let's translate that to USD 262bucks for one so2,620 for enough for his traffic 5250request per second cool so if we assumethis is all evenlydistributed dhhnumbers v50 requests persecond he said 500 corescool and that's also for handling thepeak traffic so if it's an eight hourwork day Peak traffic is probablysomewhere in the middle I think it'sfair to say that most seconds in the dayit's probably closer to a tenth thisprobably even lower so let's work withthat assumption I will I'll average itout and say it's as low as a tenth ashigh asD50 and we'll average this to 2625 whichis is generous to say that is the numberof requests per second on average I'msure it's way lower and on the weekendsit's almost nothing so let's multiplythat by 60 for minuteshours anddays and we'll say that's the number ofrequests per monthcool nowlet's blindly assume all of thesenumbers on the server list sideobviously unfair too there's a lot ofother things we might have or not havehere I will say that one gig of RAM isalmost certainly not necessary if allthis is doing is grabbing values out ofdatabase and then rendering HTML I goingto grab the request count here also 1second per request is insane so we'llsay it's 0.5 seconds per request 283million requests a month and I want tobe clear once again this is napkinmath we end up with 70 milliongab seconds let's do the math quick nowwe have all thenumbers I'll round up to 71million look atthat with relatively generousassumptions on both sides that I wouldconsider quite Fair it would be half asexpensive to run the same service onserverless because remember thoseservers still cost money on the weekendswhen no one is using them he could setup load balancing but he can't do thatbecause he's buying his own Hardware itis less than half the price and I amsure you can poke a lot of holes to thisand I'm sure people are going to I Ialready know it's going to bescreenshotted and put on Twitter peopleare going to say I'm really stupid to beclear if you are getting sustainedtraffic at this level or if in the likeaverage day you're only going as low aslike half that level of trafficabsolutely go spin up a server for itbut if your Peak traffic is that muchhigher than the weekend traffic using asystem like this is hilariously cheapand if you don't want to have to spendall of the time figuring out theprovisioning cost performance balancingout all of the stuff which like by theway if this way of building was easierfor them than this way they should gowith that because $1,000 a month Gap is$112,000 a year if I could save myEngineers a meaningful amount of effortand make them happier by paying 12 Granda year that's a no-brainer a companywideexpense for that both of these numbersare really small relative to theengineers that you have at your companythat's that's just reality and like Iwould hope most people are starting tosee the benefits of building this way itmakes your applications more resilientit makes it easier to do deployments androll backs in preview environments andall of these types of things it bereally hard to convince me the developerexperience of doing things theserverless way is worse than doing itthe dhh way and in the vast majority ofreal application workflows that arefacing external sources be it users beit external apis whatever else thosehave enough traffic fluctuation that youhave to either set up really complexload balancing or massivelyover-provision this is what theover-provisioning looks like and againrelative the number of devs it's stillquite cheap and when I was at twitch andwe were doing complex video injest stuffthis is the rout we went don't do videoinjest on several us it makes literallyno sense to do that but we were spinningup servers that cost a lot more than$2,600 a month and weren't even thinkingtwice about it because it was still waycheaper than the engineers working onthe thing in the time it was saving themI had some bad math here that I want tocorrect for this video don't know how wewill deal with that in post so we agreedthe23, 500,000 requests per month isreasonable this is the mistake I madeyeah I did 60 * 60 * 30 it should havebeen 60 * 24 * 30 that divid 60 * 24 theactual number of requests is half noteven so let's redo the math and like Iwas already being generous to the dhhside I made a huge error on my part2835 472 bucksbut serverless is so expensive H God noI'm just annoyed at this point so toclose this very long one out I'm goingto reference a video of mine and it'spretty easy to find if you go to mychannel you hit videos you popular it'sthis guy the real cost of AWS and how toavoid it it's about to hit half amillion plays which will make it my mostpopular video ever the real cost of AWSisn't all of the things we've beentalking about today it's the amount oftime you're spending building theand if you can use a service like Lambdaor versell or netlify or Cloud flare orupload thing or Planet scale or turo orany of these things and it saves ameaningful amount of time for yourdevelopers it is probably cheaper thanwhatever it costs so as fun as it is forall of us to sit here and nerd out aboutthese gaps these don't compare topayroll and if this solution hererequires you to have two more Engineersnot worth it if this solution requiresyou to have one more engineer also notworth it so be reasonable but how youmake these decisions stop in as muchabout these numbers because the gap'snot that big in serverless not only isit not too expensive it's often cheaperthan the alternative for any realistictraffic and scale to zero results in amuch better development environment andexperience let you do things you can'tdo with serversand yeah that's it should probably do areal outro for a video this long but Idon't care let me know why I'm wrong inthe comments until next time peace NS",
    "summary": "This YouTube video transcript breaks down serverless computing, starting with a historical overview, explaining the evolution from monolithic LAMP stacks to distributed microservices on separate servers. It explains how AWS has made optimizations to load-balancing that accidentally invented serverless computing and discusses key features like fast startup times, stateless design, and scaling to zero. The video's central argument is that the requirements imposed by serverless actually lead to better software development practices, particularly by encouraging functional programming and separation of state. It highlights how serverless architecture forces developers to write cleaner, more testable code with clearer inputs and outputs.\n\nThe video then addresses two common concerns about serverless: scaling to zero and cost. It argues that the primary benefit of scaling to zero isn't saving money on production environments with no users, but enabling powerful development workflows with infinite deployments, preview environments, and easy rollbacks. It uses the examples of PlanetScale and Turso to illustrate the benefits of this model. The transcript dives into a detailed cost analysis, comparing serverless Lambda functions to dedicated VPS servers, showing that with certain traffic patterns, specifically services with spikes in traffic, serverless can actually be more cost-effective than traditional server setups. It ultimately concludes that developer time and experience should be prioritized over raw infrastructure costs, suggesting that the time saved and improved workflows enabled by serverless often outweigh the potential increase in operational expenses."

industry than Googledoes on your personal data in this videothe prime engine is going to walk youthrough not one but both of his gitcourses I'll try to keep this introshort because Prime does a better job oftalking in front of the camera than I dobut I just wanted to let you know whatyou're getting into now in each coursethere are 11 chapters which means 22chapters in total you'll learn how toset up git what repositories are getinternals get configs branches how tomerge how to rebase get reset whatremotes are how to use GitHub with Gitand ignoring files with G ignore in thesecond half of the course you'll learnhow to Fork AO how to use ref log mergeconflicts rebase conflicts squashingstashing reverting cherry-picking getbisect get work trees and tags it's alot the first half of this course primescourse number one is really all aboutlearning how to use git as a solodeveloper and course number two coversall the stuff you need to know to usegit effectively in a team Prime hasspent over eight months writing thesecourses and the rest of the boot de teamand I have spent that same amount oftime really helping to edit test andrefine them so I hope you enjoy them butthis is a very Interactive Ive course Ido not recommend sitting down andbinging it in one sitting there areinteractive lessons and projects theentire way so get your hands on thekeyboard and actually follow along infact I actually recommend that you takethe course on boot Dev and go ahead ofprime and then watch him go through thatsame lesson so you can see his approachhis commentary and his Solutions afteryou've had a chance to experiment andand challenge yourself and do ityourself now all of the content in thisYouTube video and all of the content onbootd are completely free there's noneed to sign

are now going toofficially start the entire boot dodevlearn get I'm going to go through my I'mgoing to go through the course that Icreated I want to do it and it's goingto be awesome here we go we're going togo through the course we're not going towatch the videos because guess what thisis my course in 2005 after licensedisputes with bitkeeper lonus Tal'screator of Linux you may have heard ofit sort of runs the web not a big dealdecides to write his own Version Controlhe wrote git in 5 days and within acouple years it became a widely usedVersion Control and now today it is thede facto standard for all developers tobe clear when I say get I don't mean aninsult from across the pond and I don'tmean GitHub gitlab stash or any of theothers all of those companies use gitthey are not git git allows you to trackcode changes over time by author with aset of commands to search manipulate andrevert history in simple term gitcreates a commit a commit is just a setof changes tied to an author time of dayand other information as many commits asyou want can be added to the graph atany commit you can Branch off and createnew commits on the new line any of thesebranches can be merged into any otherBranch including the main line commitscan be squashed into one commit andcommit messages can be edited also gitcommits can be reverted just in casethey don't want terrible code git isvery complicated piece of software butthe interface and operations are verysimple and in this course we're going tobe going over installing and configuringget porcelain in plumbing commandsinspecting G history branching mergingand rebasing undoing changes and remoterepos and GitHub I hope you enjoy thiscourse and in about another month or twoI will be releasing part two which willgo over all the advanced featuresAdvanced Techniques with merges andrebases and conflicts and of course justreally diving into some of the morecomplex parts of git but in this courseyou should be able to get everything youneed to become quite proficient in thereal world incl including understandinghow git works thename is the gagen I already haveeverything done I might need to updateboot dodev hold on one second all rightthere we go I'm going to get the latestversion here we go go install I thoughtthey I thought that was a thing Hanyways okay there we go we got the newboot dodev everything's looking goodlet's do a little boot Dev version ohyeah looking hot looking good perfect Ibelieve I should all be logged in so I'mjust going to go like this just to makesure that I'm logged inthere we go echoing rebasing his basethere we go everything good I believeI'm I believe I'm allgood perfect okay submit so this is thecool part by the way so this tool wasdeveloped Ithink the motivation started with mycourse and other courses I think Lanewas developing one that also needed itas well but this tool is super cool soyou copy this thing you paste it in andwhen you go right here look at that itsays hey you did everything correct okayfantastic all right we've alreadyinstalled git I already have everythinginstalled I don't need to worry aboutany of that all right we'll do thatthing as well okay perfect the CLI is socool it is all right read the friendlymanual one of the best parts of G isthat all the documentation is fantasticbut that wasn't always the case by theway it was actually the the gitdocumentation to this day I actuallycan't read the uh man G tag page stillokay so everybody knows what a tag isright we all know what a tag is a let'ssee add a tag reference in ref tagsunless DV dlv is given to delete list orverify tags um okay okay I think weunderstand this right unless f is giventhe named tag must not yet exist andthen this is happened to create a takeobject or requires take message unless Mor f file is given and editor is startedfor the user okay what the hell is a tagthough can you just tell me what it isotherwise a tag reference pointsdirectly to a given object I know it'sjust like is this just a wild I'msurprised the very first descriptionisn't being like a tag is a mut aimmutablenamed pointer I'm just like what the fuis this all right who created getobviously I did a by the way lonustvols did create git in 5 days and TheStory Goes Like This he created git infive days because one of the one of themaintainers of Linux broke the bitkeeperlicense to Linux bitkeeper said you canuse bitkeeper you're just not allowed toreverse engineer the protocol andsomebody reverse engineered the protocoland get and bitkeeper said get the hellout of here get out and so they actuallyhad no more uh subversion at that pointor whatever bitkeeper was so he wrote toin 5 days now remember git was notfriendly at all you had to use all theplumbing right you had to use like youhad to like cat out the file you had tocreate the tree like you had to do allthe tracking yourself and it was not funright it was not good it was not goodbut anyways lonus did it all in just amoment and he did it in five days thenon the sixth day he rested porcelain andplumbing for whatever reason get iscompared to the crapper uh rip John crapand so porcelains the outside the goodstuff uh the plumbing is like the hardthings the like the underlying tools youcan use with Git all right so in getcommands are divided into highlecommands and lowl commands the porcelaincommands are the ones that you will usemost often as a developer to interactwith your code some porcelain commandsare these on don't worry about what theydo yet we'll cover them in detail soonabsolutely by the way some examples ofPlumbing are this one get apply give getcommit Tre get hash object in which Ibarely know any of what those things dowe'll focus on the highle commandsbecause that's what you use 99% of thetime in fact I've never professionallyuse the lower levelcommands right BCT is I I I believe is aporcelain command um reflog porcelaincommand cherry pick porcelain commandit's a bit confusing right all right 99%of the time porland commands are used tointeract with Git yeah but you can and Ihave done it but it's really good tounderstand how they work if youunderstand how the the plumbing worksthe porcelain makes a lot of sense allright quick and fig we need theconfigure get uh with your informationuh whenever you code yeah blah BL blahblah blah so we got to do this thing wegot to add our name in our config so ifyou've never done config and get getjust has this whole Global it'sliterally just a file that's all it isis just a file and it's either in globalspace which means it's in your uh homedirectory or it's within yourg fer sokind of either or there anyways this ispretty good so we can uh we can do thisconfig set username email so I'm goingto make sure let's see uh get config uhlocal what do I got here oh whoopsies uhis it List local I always forget how touse this one air keys does notcontain get config what what what is itit's it's list oh yeah I forget list isthe only one config is the only one thathas this older way of doing a bunch ofDash dashes whereas like when you usesomething like get stash you go like getstash list whereas with config you gothis kind of list and always it always Ialways have to remember what the hellI'm doing right there okay local so asyou can see I have all these thingsthese are all the good stuff this is uhfrom graphite so don't don't mind thathere we're going to probably want to dostuff little get config uh list GP namedo I have a name in there I do I havethe name uh there we go I have emailperfect bada bing bada boom we got thosethings already set so I have all thatand you add it to your Global so youryou're Global by the way if you just golike this you can go uh whoopsies getconfig right it's right there it justtakes the latest value allright and so we also have this onefinally let's set the default Branchwe'll talk more about this so we're allon the same page we're going to set thedefault Branch to master to begin withso the funny part is is thatum hey heynow let's see hey nowGlobal and then you have to go uh whatis it is itadd look at that there we go add therewe go so it takes the latest oneprobably need to do an ad might want tomake a little note there never caughtthat problem only level two week I hadto reset my entire account all rightmake sure it works so there's a reasonwhy we do this so we can show you to doit differently later right but it'sMaster by default true but a lot ofpeople already have it say updated tomain or to trunk or something else so Ijust wanted to make sure that we hadthis such that everybody can change itum and see what it is so there you goall right so we can C the config awesomeyou saw that we CED the configeverything looks good all right we'regoing to kind of rush through theseearly ones because I don't think they'revery they're not that important and whenyou're learning how to use git theseones don't make a lot of sense like whatthe heck is this config thing why are wesetting all these things we just got todo it to set up your repo so youunderstand how git works right so thisis all confusing stuff you're probablyvery confused if you're new to getthat's fine it's[Music]okay all rightso all right the very first step uh ofany project is to create a repository aget repository or repo represents asingle project you typically have onerepository for each project you work onit would be wild to see manyrepositories for a single project unlessif you're considering uh Forks SL yeahwebflix you like that a repo isessentially just a directory thatcontains a project other directory orfiles the only difference is that italso contains a hidden git directorythis was a big eye opener for me isrealizing that the that the dogit isliterally the entirestate of your G project it's like theentire thing and so if you're everhaving questions about what's going oneverything is actually stored in here sowhen you think oh how does it know everylike how does it know all my branchesit's literally in the git directoryeverything about it is in the gitdirectory uh webflix this uh this coursewe'll be managing content for webflix animaginary self-hosted video streamingapplication can you imagine why wouldwhy would we name it webflix that makesno sense let's see navigate to somewherein your file system where you'd like tostore the project and once you're therecreate a new directory called webflixall right uh rmrf I bet you webflixalready exists in my oh my gosh get thehell out of there oh get the hell out ofthere okay makeer webflix there we goand webflix there we go now I'm in hereit's brand new right it's empty nothingin here and so I'm I'm assuming we'regoing to have to get init get init justcreates the new empty directory right itdoesn't do anything other than itcreates a brand new directory it usesourconfig let's go so I should be able togo ls- la you can see a git folder righthere if I find inside the git folderit's pretty empty it just has all thisstuff it has a bunch of sample prehhooks it has no objects which is whereit stores everything it has uh nothing Ibelieve even the head is a little bitgoofy if I'm not mistaken there you gothat was weirdcat get head there yougo weird huh getting it yeah all rightso anyways we do all this one awesome sonow that we have our uh repo initializedlet's actually get into the stuff isthis VOD G stay online it's actuallygoing to be moved to the uh boot dodevYouTube there we go we got all this thislooks good let's go return to ourbrowser done got him man I'm so good atthis I'm getting so much stats look atthis I'm already level two a file can beone of the several States let's see afile can be in one of several States ina get repository here's a few importantones untracked staged committed okaythis is very important this is also veryimportant to understand because I'velost so much work not understanding thedifference between all of these allright the get status command shows youthe current state of your repo all rightso assignment every good contentmanagement system needs a table ofcontents create a file in your

MD d uh paste this thingin Bam Bam get status you'll see righthere untracked files that means gitdoesn't know anything about this thisfile an untracked file means that it'snever been added to the index which islike your staging area or it's neverbeen tracked so it just says we don'tknow what's in it so if you delete thisfile you lose every last bit of contentbecause I'm pretty sure there's been alot ofpeople that have goofed that up yeahI've done it it hurts it's emotionally abruising experience to accidentally havea file that was untracked you think it'stracked you do something and you deleteit and Fs you removed untracked filesyeah removing untracked files is isemotionally painful because you can'treally recover it it's a right ofpassage it's a right of passage toemotionally bruise yourself all rightthere we go so now I should be able tojump in here I should be able to run thelittle tool there we go everything'sgood all right so staging staging you'llnotice the term index a lot so if we gointo here and we go mangit uh what's itcalled add you'll probably notice theword index quite a bit in hereand the index is literally just thechanges that you have staged onto yoursystem that means any untracked filesbecome tracked files and only the entirechanges are tracked at that point therewe go uh add this one let's see forexample I use Arch by the way rightwithout staging every file in therepository would be included in everycommit but that's often not what we wantall right so you want to get add thefile so I'm going to add the contentsand then do this now me personallywhenever I do stuff I usually hit a getstatus if the tree represents what Iwant it to be meaning that the changesare what I want and we have just thisone untracked file I often will just useget add this now here's the deal aboutget ad okay that's a little goofy allright uh get status uh when you do thishere I'm going to go like this I'm goingto go touch Fu if I go like this getstatus you'll notice that Foo isuntracked as well if I make her uh Fufuand CD into Fufu and then get add thisyou'll notice that Fu remains untrackedthat's because get add dot addseverything at that directory and Beyondit doesn't add it doesn't add things inthe directory P you have to usedifferent ones like get add capital Athat kind of stuff but we're not talkingabout that okay we're not talking aboutthatuh there you go get get the hell out ofhere there we go status we got thatfantastic um so I should be able to justrun this we've now added it our contentshave been added we're looking good we'relooking good oh man I'm getting so muchexperience points I I'm I'm almost levelthree after staging a file we can commitit a commit is a snapshot of therepository at any given time so this isvery very important and this is a thingthat a lot of people don't understandabout gitgit is not storing diffs git stores theentire history per commit so your entiregit everything is in a single commit andthat's very very important distinctionto make because a lot of people don'trealize that okay so our assignment iscommit the contents to file this withthe message add contents this you wouldnormally start a commit message with aobviously this is because we're doingstuff with boot dodev so it wants to beable to keep track of all your commitsand all that so there we go then run getstatus skin you should see that the fileis no longer staged right all right solet's go back here uh let's zoom in uhget commit let's see uh getcommit there we go we did that and so ifwe go get status you can see we have aclean working tree get log one lineYou'll see that we have one thing rightthere let's see wait it so it doesn'tstoreper change commit no and density I'llshow you why in just a moment so thiscourse is meant to really show you whatis going on here all right so now thatwe have that I should be able to justtake this boot. Dev paste that in therego right here awesome I did it I'm I'msmat I'm smat I'm real smat uh half ofgit you've learned half of G you'veliterally learned half of git we justget commit statusaddcommit right that's all you need to knowstatus add commit that's like most ofI know that's crazy to think of butthat's it half of G easy you're likeyou're like a senior engineer at thispoint it's not near half though I knowof course it's not actually near halfbecause when you go like this get uh uhwhen you go like this man get Dashyou'll notice that there's 151possibilities but of those possibilitiesthree of them is what you pretty muchuse constantly which commands adds afile to the staging area Prime is itPrime no add right it's in the namedummies it's in the name name dummiesall right get log get uh okay log isfantastic by the way log is one of thosesleepers that people don't know how touse but there's so many good stuff to alog get repo is a potentially very longlist of commits where each commitrepresents a full state of the history agit log command shows a history uh in arepository this is what makes get aVersion Control System you can see whomade the commit when the commit was madeand what was what was changed so there'sa lot of cool things so here so thisright here so they we'll see what uh hemade us do this goes get no pager Ibelieve this just simply will output thegit log so normally when you do git logit actually outputs this like secondscreen that's kind of like less ifyou've ever use the Tool uh less that'sall it's doing instead no pager justprints it directly out it just prints itto standard out and log is the commandN1 means the last 10 commits but whatyou really want to do is you want uh youcan do things like one line that willmake it nice and smooth so you can justsee this nice beautiful thing you can douh parents which will do annotation wedon't have any parents yetwe don't got no parents we are theBatman of commits uh and you there's abunch of stuff graph is really cool ifyou're working on something cuz graph isyou'll notice that there's like a littleAster right here it will actually graphhow your commits are being merged backin and how the uh different branches aregoing so we're orphans right now we'reeffectively orphans right now or you canthink of us like Adam maybe we're thefirst huh it's not that bad right rightall right do the one of those there wego bada bing bada boom all right solet's get into some real stuffdifferent hashes my latest commit uh orso in this example the commit hash wasthis our commit hash was what 78 blahblah and that's because whenever you doanything with Git the hashes can't youcan technically do a hash collision bybeing able to generate the same gitchanges from the same author at the sametime and whatever other information thatit uses with the same parent and allthat you could actually create the thehash is consistent it's recreated everysingle time so it's an important Pointall right there we go if you're notcareful you'll have two commits with thesame hash false you'd have to be verycareful to create that and I don'tbelieve that's even a uh it's not evenlike a yeah g is the original blockchainfor those that are wondering all rightyou may have noticed that even though weyou and I both have the same content inour repositories we have differenthashes yes we already went through allthis yes they do a sha one it'sbeautiful which does let's see whichdoes not affect the uh the hash of acommit the commit time stamp messageauthor's preferred text editor eventhough it should I do think all Vimhashes should start with 777 a littlebit of luckiness to it to me that's theonly appropriate thing to do all rightthe plumbing so far we've used git in aporcelain manner but the let's see butto Sate our insatiable curiosity Sate isa weird word okay Lane may have done alittle bit of writing for me in thisone just so you know uh let's take alook at the plumbing all right it's justfiles all the way down all the data inthe git repository is stored directly inthe hidden file you can actually seethat look at this if I go like this if Igo find inside the git folder you'llnotice something right away look at thislook at that thing that thing looks justlike this thing right here right 7805172 7805 172 look at that huh kind ofcrazy right that's mycommit okay sneaky git veryShakespearean I know he's veryShakespearean he uses phrases likeupstairs and downstairs and it's crazyall right git is made up of objects thatare stored in the git objects directoryuh a commit is just a type of an objectcorrect use log 10 to view your commithash do this inside the object directoryand we already did that we already sawit which uh let's see which matches theformat of the file you'll notice heretoo so this is something that youprobably don't know about Linux uh thisright here this is called an inodebusting effectively what IOD busting isis that a directory can actually end uphaving too many files in it if you everdone it weird stuff starts happeninghappen happening so instead get toprevent iode busting or to prevent iodewhatever it is you'll do this so thistakes the first two letters and thendoes this right i' I've ran out of iodesbefore yes I i' I've goofed up myself soa directory can only be such a largesize so therefore this just helpsseparate out things this is very commonyou'll see this in CDN cdns do the exactsame thing the actual naming underneathwill start doing weird stuff like thisscrew you unlinks your list yeah it isit I've done it once I dude I noteissues are insane by the way they'recrazy yep I ran into this with a massivelog directories exactly you have to do Inote busting or else you just life ispainful and I did it once and then onceyou do it once you never do it you justnever do it again all right that's itthat's all there is to it all right sothat's why they do this they take thefirst two and they turn it into adirectory so that way it just kind ofspread thingsout all right so let's take a uh let'stake a look at what's inside thissuspicious get commit object file haveyou ever tried catting one of thosethings the first thing I ever did when Ifound out get was just a folder is wentright to objects went right to my commitand tried to cat it out and it's justthis right that's a bunch ofright there okay what the hell does thisevenmean all right so you can't really doanything no it's a mess uh let's see thecontents have been compressed to Rawbites so that's why git remains small isbecause git compresses things and that'svery very important all right now thelesson let's see okay hold on thislessons run and submit are a bitdifferent because you need to tell boot.Dev CLI where your commit object islocated all right so we're going to dothe exact same thing so I have to dothis but I have to give it this nameright path to file right so I'm going tograb this thing and I'm going to go likethis uh let's go get objects 780505 this thing and then submit I believeI did that correctly this one I screwedup last time I tried to dothis let's see failed to get this thingpage not found wait who's he what's heall right let me reread this one sorrysometimes sometimes I'm not good atreading lessons Okay I just want you toknow that rtfm read the friendly manualsometimes I don't read the friendlylesson okay let's look at this again tryto C the contents of the file we alreadydid that nope it's a mess the contentshas been compressed um we can we canprint in a decimal I don't really carethis lessons run and submit are a bitdifferent because you need to tell boot.CLI where your commit object is locateduh run and submit the test but providethe path to your commit object file as asecond argument run lesson lesson IDokay so let's try this again because I'mapparently I'm toostupid so I need to go boot. run lessonID path to fileokay get objects 78052 there we go look at that I'm gettingso much exp I'm level four you guyswouldn't understand practically a grandwizard Arc Mage I don't think you'resupposed to be a grand wizard rightthat's not uh you don't want to be thatyou don't want to be that guy okay Iforget sometimes I forget things okay uhluckily git has a built-in Plumbingcommand cat file that allows us to seethe contents of a commit without needingto fuss around with the object filesdirectly so you just use get cat file- Pcuz technically like if you're viewing atree you have to use a tree command youknow there's all these different thingsbut cat file just allows us to look ateverything at once without having toworry about its type and all that uh soyou can just go get CAT file this so ifI do this get cat file this guy and do78517 I believe you only need up I thinkyou only need technically you only needfour to specify it you'll noticesomething when I cat out my commityou'll see the author and all this andthen you'll see the message that's soit's nice then you see this tree commandlook at this tree this hash we don'tknow what this hash is right so I canactually go get uh get cat file- P 5B21d and then you'll notice that it has ablob object and that blob object is aContent so to kind of put this inperspective you can think of a tree as adirectory and you can think of a blob asa file so that's kind of important toknow so when I cat file this thingyou'll notice that it's contents whichis the exact contents of our contentsfile they're identical so do you seewhat happened there why did I capitalizeB for those that don't know why Icapitalize B uh when I type I havedvorac but even more so when I typenumbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 you'llnotice that I typed out symbolssymmetric symbols it's because I'veoptimized my keyboard to prevent wristpain from happening because I program alot so I have to hit shift to type mynumbers right so sometimes I'll do acapital B when trying to type stuffbecause I'm still holding shift doesthat make sense okay there's no there'sno reason or Rhyme or anything to dowith it it automatically lowercased itfor me it didn't mean anything all rightso there you go you can see that so thisis actually really cool what justhappened here look at this I was able tocat my commit out take the rootdirectory tree cat that out see the filethat was there then cat that file outand see the contents of that file thisis very important because we'll use itlater to grab stuff out it's kind of funit's kind of it's kind of neat so therewe go so we can do that all right so usecat to do all this one pass an argumentto the CLI notice that boot. Dev CLItest for this lesson take an additionalargument to noted by this one rightthere we go you need to provide the hashokay so I need to provide the hash therewe go all right we'll do that we'regoing to grab that bad boy and I'm goingto go like um I'm going to go like thatand then I need to grab the is it whichhash are we doing that you need toprovide the hash of your last commitokay we need to provide the hash of thelast commit there we go so I'm going togo back uphere I think that's all I need totechnically do d s and then take outthis little slash I think that should doeverything I need to do there we go gotit first try got it so good at this whywould you ever need to do that in getyou'll see you don't technically need todo this in get but it's really good tounderstand why this is where the big eyeopening moments about to happen foreverybody about how git actually worksbecause what we've seen so far is thatwe've made one commit right we've madeone commit and we're going to call it aand in that commit we have a tree that'slike our root directory and inside thattree we have a blob which happens to besome big long hash and it is contents.MD all right this is very important sothis is our Commit This is commit a sonow we're going to add this and we'regoing to see how this changes all rightall right I believe I did all this allright trees and blobs now that weunderstand some of our plumbingequipment let's get into the pipeshere's the terms you need to know treeis a way of storing a directory blob isa way of sorting storing a file so youcan see right here I already showed youthis there's the tree we are able to gothrough through the tree and get all theway to the blob right assignment use getcat file again but this time use it ontree you should see a blob with its ownhash use cat file again on this onesubmit the sees with The Blob hash okaywe should already be able to do all thisuh because we actually already did thisall right let's find this little bad boyright here where are you where are youwhere the hell are you there itishey there we go by bing bada boom ableto grab all that stuff out I justgrabbed out the file hash cuz I knewwhat it was or the blob hash all rightsecond uh second command uh reminder ofcommands get log um and Cat file that'swhat we've been doing log is a porcelaincommand where cat file is a plumbingcommand you'll use log more often whenworking with the code uh on codingprojects but cat file is useful forunderstanding gets internals we alreadykind of talked about that so we're goingto create a second file called titlesthis is where things get reallyinteresting are you ready for this uhall right so we're going to go like thistitles. MD paste this all in here deletethat one uh run through and then we needto save stage and commit the file withthe files long as it starts with a Bright that's the thing get uh add thisget commit with aB There we go awesome and then run theCLI there we go I'm going to grab theCLI and we're going to do this bada bingbada boom all right so we've created asecond commit right this is how you willunderstand get get stores an entiresnapshot of files on a per commit levelthis was a surprise to me I alwaysassumed each commit Only Stores thechanges made in that commit now type onein the chat if that's what you thoughttoo I assume a lot of you thought theexact same thing that get stored Deltasright yeah I mean look at this a lot alot of changes in here and I thinkthat's completely normal anyone thatdoesn't think that get stored Deltasright away you're lying to yourselfyou're like yeah I didn't think that Ialways knew that it didn't do that noyou didn't okay your your small braindid not think that we all thought thatbecause that's totally normal thing tothink okay well it's true that g storesentire snapshots it does have someperformance optimization so that yourgit directory doesn't be get toounbearably large get compresses andpacks files to store them moreefficiently get D duplicates files thatare the same across commits now you'reprobably thinking isn't that just Deltastores hold on let's find out let's justfind out okay watch this we're going touse git cat file and we're going to findthe hash blob of our titles MD okaywatch this all right so I'm going to golike this uh I'm going to go uh let'ssee I'm going to go get log log one lineI'm going to grab this last that's mylast hash right there we go I'm going togo get uh get cat F I know there'sbetter ways to find your your currenthash just shut up this is good enoughthis is good for people to understandnow notice that we have our tree alsonotice we have our parent now so ourparent is our previous commit so we canactually walk back up the tree if weneeded to this is if you're wonderinghow git log works is that it storesparent pointers as part of the commitall right anyways so we're going to takeour tree and go get CAT file- P this now notice that there's twoblobs okay there's two blobs here thefirst blob is the previouscontents and this one is now titles okayso I can actually take this and go getCAT uh file- p and I can actually catout the titlesfile uh I can actually go to this oneand get cat uh G cat uh cat file- p andI can cut out this one and this willgive you the contents of that file butnotice this right here I want you tolook at this would you look at it for asecond I'm going to jump into my parentget cat I'm sure I explain this in amoment in the course but I like toexplain it this way uh there's ourparent commit I'm going to grab thattree notice that that tree is differentthan uh is a little bit different likeeverything's a little bit different thisis the older version of the tree get catfile- P this look at contents look atcontents it stores a unique tree percommit but that that doesn'tmean it stores the entire file it juststores a pointer to the file so when Isay A commit stores the entire historyit stores everyreference I know kind of mind blownright that's why it's efficient becausewhat happens is you can think of it thisway is that let's say we have Commit aand commit a has the parent tree andthen it has the blob that's pointed toour contents file okay and this is likelet's just say it's like e f and then abunch of letters right blah blah blahblah commit B adds that new file and soit's going to have that same tree butthis is going to be a different noticethat the hash is different on this treebecause this tree has a new set of kidsso something has happened to this treewhich means that it can even point totrees that have not changed that's veryimportant so we have a new tree we'rejust going to call this one one we'llcall this one two and this one is stillpointing to that exact same EF blah blahblah blah but then we have a new onewhich is going to be our titles which isgoing to have its uh we're going toprobably need to call this like titlesand then it's going to have its owncommit right here and so it doesn'tupdate this this Remains the Same soit's very important to understandthat all right so let's see what we haveto do here all right we're going to usecat file we're going to view the uh thehash of The Blob for our titles and youcan do that save that hash somewhere inyour notes all right let's save thishash somewhere in the notes because wehave to find it there we go it's rightthere I can just come back to that lateradd a new new directory to your projectcalled quotes inside add two files allright so let's uh Vim uh what is it yousayquotes they say quotes I can't rememberquotes yeah I think so uh what was thefirst one called uh star wars.MD and then what was the other one uhDune MD Dune by the way is a great movieDune Dune can also be fall under thegood Sci-Fium all right so there we go we havethose two things stage and commit bothfiles in a single commit with themessage C add quotes perfect okay we cando that uh get status you can see it'sright there get add this thing getcommit DM put all that in there get logone line should have three commits youcan even go like this get log - P whichwill show the differences so this firstone adds this new file uh from nothingto quotes Dune from nothing to quotesStar Wars and then it doesn't make anyother uh edits right and there's theprevious commit which adds titles andthe previous commit before that whichadd contents okay cool awesome we gotall those things all right so we did allthat one use the command CAD file toview the hash of The Blob for uh titlesagain you'll notice that it's still thesame hashcorrect there you go because the filehasn't changed run submit this thingPerfect Isn't thatcool Isn't that cool I think that'spretty cool I mean I think that's veryvery cool for me that was a verymind-blowing moment is to understand howgit works because then it no longer feltas confusing and that was my big kind oflike I I I I got really really confusedfor quite some time when I first playedaround with Git because ofthat thing all right what does it meanthat files uh which were once committedthen deleted will be forever kept by gitso technically it's not forever kept bygit it's forever kept by your historyunless if you prune your history so youcan actually prune your history out ofgit and so that way it would actuallyclean up any broken references so itdoesn't actually keep say deletedcommits that don't exist so get prune DFyeah so that will go through so we willactually do that I'll I believe in thisuh in this section we will actuallyrevive a file that was long lost or acommit that was long lost it's kind ofobvious that it's store snapshototherwise you need to walk back the treea lot for files that don't change oftenyeah I mean it's it's obvious inhindsight but I think the first time youthink and you download the first timeyou ever use a a Version Control youthink wow how could it possibly everstore everything it must have to likecreate the repo by walking all theselinks that's why it gets so fast is itdoesn't it keeps your tree and then whenyou need to change your directory itliterally just walks that tree andrecreates every single file at each oneof thosepoints right that's but the first timeyou you wouldn't understand that rightlet's see 100% of the working let's see100% of working with Git is checkoutBranch ad commit push Force push rebaseor merge yes exactly that's why I saythat's well I mean it's not 100% it'slike 99 95 there's log there's ref logref log is incredibly important we'regoing to go over that there's also likeget checkout so get checkout theirsversus ours it's very important when youwant to be able to just grab an entirechange from one side of a merge[Music]conflict let's take a command apart getconfig okay so here we go we're going toactually start talking about config nowcu the config is actually useful to useand understand because sometimes youactually want want to be able to changeways in which your G experience changesor in which in which it operates solet's look at this all right so let'stake a look at the command so get configis obviously the top level it's stillthe older style command so instead ofget config ad it's get config D- adwhich is kind of a pain in the assGlobal is where to store it so it'seither Global or local there's someother places you can store and get butnobody actually stores things in gitright uh or in those ones at least asfar as I can tell I don't know of anyuse case where you store in system uhI'm sure there is a use case I've justnever personally ran into it I've alwaysjust used you know local or Global allright uh so Global stored in uh thisright here in your uh home directory getconfig whereas local is stored insideyour git configure right so if I go likethis if I go in here and I go uh let'ssee uh let's see what is it LS or findin my gitfolder what is it name is it config Ithink it's config there you go yeahthere we go uh cat config it'll sayhere's the things that are inside ofyour local repository so when it createsa config object it actually takes yourglobals then it takes your logos andkind of combines them one at a time allright assignment you can actually storeuh any old data in your gitconfiguration granted only certain keysare used by git but you can storewhatever you want yeah it's just a keyvalue mapping that's all it is so youcan like uh I know when I was at Netflixwe actually had a lot of informationstored for how we operated over certainstuff so it just I used to have a bunchof Netflix stuff on my system at onepoint uh set the following uselesskey/value pairs in your local gitconfiguration so right here so we'regoing to do this for our locals allright so it's not too hard so you can golike this get config add local so I wantto add a key value and I want to do itlocally and then what do we want webflixuh CEO okay the prime gen okay uhactually yeah we'll call the prime genand then we'll do uh the CTO as thelanen right that's the actual CEOof um what's it called of boot. Dev andthen valuation valuation mid it's a midit's a good mid valuation hey who herewouldn't want a good mid valuation githas a command to view the contents rightso if you just go List local it's goingto list everything you can also just catit out right so as we did earlier you'llsee here's our top level uh sectionhere's our keys and values uh so a goodthing to notice here is that this is aSE section and this is a key so when youlook at this you'll notice that this isthe section this is the key that'simportant to know because you canactually delete all configuration bysection or by sectionKeys all right so there you go you canList local so if I just go get configList local it'll just uh list all myjust local only files righthere all right so let's grab this thingjump in here paste it in your companyposition midisn't that everybody's companyposition by the way configs were one ofthe more confusing parts for me notconfusing by how they operate becausethey're actually exceptionally simplebut when I first started using gitconfig was something that I executedonce and then I never looked at againand then then whenever I had to touch itI was just like I don't want to dothis right and then I just got allconfused by stuff and then I just itfelt confusing because I refused to justspend the three minutes it took tounderstand said it and forget it exactlyand then you just don't know how certainthings operate and simply because youdidn't learn this really simple thingthis is why I did config because configis one of those extremely useless thingsyou should pretty much never need toknow but that one little moment you needto know it it's very useful it's veryvery useful we've used list to see allthe configuration values but get flag isuh useful for when you're trying to geta single value right so we can do get uhkey remember a key is a section. keyname so username webflix CEO there we goso I can we can get the web value so Ican go uhget get uh let's see what is it webwebflix webflixvaluation and it'll go and get mid niceright doesn't get config username justget it uh get config user.name yeah italso gets it you could get must get isthe default operation but it's good toknow that because you can also do do setright all right there you go beautifulwe did that one uh bada bing bada boomall right this is looking good all rightthe unset flag is used to remove aconfiguration value for example getonset key let's remove the CTO all rightso we go like this uh get config unsetright everybody you know everybody lovesa good unset right I really hate theterm unset uh which one are we doing CTOCTO yeah all right I just fired Lanebecause you know what screw Lane whathappened when you tried to unsetuh oh try using unset to remove thesection I forgot to do that one if youdo this what ends up happening key doesnot contain a section right so you needboth a section and a you need both asection and a value or a key name forthis thing to be able to be removablewhen you use unset you have to do unsetsection if I'm not mistaken I alwaysforget the entire section it failedbecause you have to use key and valueright you have to use both you got touse both duplicates typically a keyValue Store like python dictionary youaren't allowed to have duplicate Keysstrangely enough git does not care yesif you look at my git config uh Globaluh list Global and then we GP what is itum uh a nit you'll notice that I have inhere three of them okay I had in itdefault Branch master in it defaultBranch Main in it default Branch Masteryeah it just takes the last one my badmy bad on that one yes you can yes butbut if you do that you have to forcepush right Force pushing is the only wayfor you to be able to change history foreverybody else and if you do that youwill ruin the whole repo and everybodywill know all right duplicates unset allso unset all is if you want to unset uhentire thing you only need a sectionthen right or sorry unset alls if youwant to delete a multi-existing uh key value combo which iskind of odd having an key set combo it'sjust kind of weird so if I do this and Igo like this and I add a bunch of CEOs Ishould be able to go in there and go getuh config List local and now you'llnotice we have a whole bunch of CEOsright we have four of them me plus uhCarson Warren and Sarah all right so ifI want to undo that I can remove allCEOs by doing unset all right get configunset uh webflick flick flick do CEO there we go CEOhas multiple values unset all bada bingbada boom get List local all the CEOsare gone anyways okay so now that we didall this pretty straightforward rightpretty straightforward stuff there we gothere wego awesome we're kind of getting throughthese things uh you know the config SEsection it's it's it could be boring butwhatever it's fun uh you know it's yougot you just got to learn these thingsright all right so there you go so we'regoing to do the the next thing um whichis we to remove an entire section nowwebflix is a section we have so if wejust go remove section we can actuallyremove all of it so if I go back hereand I go um I can add all of this and gogetconfiguh if I go get config List local you'llsee that I have a bunch of webflix stuffso if I go get uh config what is it it'sremove section right it's not unsetsection you know how many times Istruggle with remove section versusunset and all of that man whenever I'vehad to do anything like that I'vescrewed it all up it's so easy there yougo make sure I really get it out thereyou know what I'm talking about we wantto get it out there and then also you'llnotice that if I go like this cat configuh uh cat get config you'll notice thatit actually removes the sectionright just fun little fact fun littlefact if you're wondering you know what Imeanbless you my goodness yeah thankyou yeah you just edit the filedirectory I personally find that uh Iwould just rather jump in here and editthis often than doing all that othercrap to be real it's just it's just mucheasier CU this other thing is just it'sjust really hard you know it's justreally really annoying all rightlocations uh there's really only twolocations that you should really beconcerned about I actually never used awork tree specific location or a systemlocation I've really only done Globaland local I find location location Loanyways in my experience 99% of the timeyou'll be using Global to set thingslike your username and email the other9% of the time you'll be using local toset Project Specific configuration thelast 1% of the time you might need tofuss around with system in work treeconfiguration but it's extremely rareyeah I've never I've never personallyhad to do it I just know that it's beendone on my system so there you go here'sthe set of uh here's the set of what'sit called ordering so if you have a worktree specific it's be the most specifictherefore that's going to be the onethat gets presented then local thenGlobal then system system is like theit's kind of like just think about itlike uh JavaScript and merging arraysright system is for all users correctglobal global is not Global it's not aglobal list if that makes sense it's alocal Global you know what I mean it'snot a global global it's a local Globalall right suppose you set username toPrime at the system level username Laneat the global level and username TJ atthe local level which value willactually get TJ even though TJ doesstream but he sucks okay just so youknow yeah Global's the user it reallyshould be it it really should be repouser system for me that seems mucheasier to understand and TJ catchingStrays TJ's always catching Strays okayshots fed all right let's see which isstored at the home directory that'd be[Music]Global all right so what is a branch sonow we're going to get on to branchingso a get Branch allows you to keep trackof different changes separately forexample let's say you have a big webproject and you want to experiment withchanging the color scheme instead ofchanging the entire project directly asright now on our Master Branch you cancreate a new branch called color schemeand work on that branch and when you'redone if you like the changes you canmerge color scheme back into the masterbranch and keep the changes if you don'tlike the changes you can simply deletecolor scheme branch and go back tomaster so underneath the hood this iswhat's actually happening look at thisbeautiful little little graphic do youlike that graphic it's beautiful huhit's beautiful does this make sense sohere's a big thing that you need tounderstand tips just the tips the tipsis thecommit that is the latest one onwhatever Branch you're looking at okayso you need to know your tips and theneventually they should merge back atsome point because that's how brancheswork they should be branched off of someuh some they call it the merge base thiswould be called the merge base we don'thave that as part of this graphic sothis is called the merge base or the Leor the uh most common ancestoris one right here and so this is forwhen you merge it finds this thing righthere and then merges things togethermerge tips use rebates yeah exactly sojust so you know these are all commitsbranches lit like a branch a branch isliterally a pointer to a commit that'sit orphaned branches are wild yeah Idon't even know how to create likehonestly I don't even really know how tocreate an orphan Branch it'sexceptionally difficult to create anorphaned Branch uh it's just notsomething you do you know on purpose allright so let's see because a branch isjust a pointer to a commit they arelightweight and cheap this is why whenpeople say branches are really cheapit's because it's just a pointer that'sit uh which branch you're currentlyrunning get Branch there we go so I cango like this get branch and you can seeI'm currently on Master fantasticremember you should be on Master becausewe set initial default Branch to masterat the start of this course yeah yeahyeah so there we go um fantastic andwe're going to do that and we're goingto execute this thing Bada Bing BadaBoom Confetti feeling good confetti outof my mind all right default Branchwe've been using GS default MasterBranch interesting interestingly GitHuba website where you can remotely store Gprojects recently changed default Branchto master to main as a general rule Irecommend using Maine as your defaultBranch to work uh if you work primarilywith GitHub yeah because if you don'tyou have to like go in to every singleit's just a pain in the ass right that'sall it is if you don't do that you haveto actually go into your projects andyou have to set it as your whateverother Branch you're using as the defaultor else it will use main as the defaultand then you will get cloned down a repoand then main will be like this emptybranch and then you have to undo all ofit there you go gitlab has main too andI think newer versions of git has mainas default too I'm not sure if G newerversions of git has that as default umlike if I go like this uh get let's seeget config remove section um oh don't dothat unset all um let's see what is itit is a nit uh default a branch there wego and so if I go getconfig list there we go you'll noticethat I still have this one did I not dothis correct am I oh is it lower B oh isit really lower B is it really lower BBranch nah that can't be rightright why why are you still here why porand Maria why are you still here oh it'scuz I'm not doing gosh I'm so stupidGlobal globalist there we go I've haveundid my Global list this is veryimportant to undo your Global list therewe go list there you go it's gone youcan see that it's gone so if I go backhere and go like this make dir testy uhtesties and CD into testies uh we'll goin here and we'll go like this get an itget an IT using Master the name of thisinitial Branch this is theault Branchname subject to change to configure theinitial Branch name do this right hereinitial Branch name uh names commonlychosen uh instead of master or maintrunk Development I've seen Dev I likeusing trunk just to mess with peopleokay I think it'sfunny here get might be old uh get oh itcould be old I'm on uh245 it's pretty new get uh latest uhversion 246 yeah I'm only back I'm onlyI'm only off by a little bit I usedusing trunk just to feel somethingexactly exactly there you go okay so nowthat we're here there we go all right sohere we go all right how to rename abranch so you go go get Branch uh M forrename right classic M for rename am Iright am I right old name new name allright we're going to set our initialBranch to Main and then we're going torename our Branch all right here we gouh let's just weo back in here and getBranch M Master main get uhconfig add Global s uh we can actuallyeven do it that by the way you can alsodo it at a local level so I can go uhnit default default Branch uh what thehell the thing called it's called mainso there we go so I can actually do thisat a local level so now only this repohas the default Branch as main whereasall my other ones will still havewhatever my Global version is it's verygood to know how to use locals andglobals it can be very useful I've hadto do a lot of things where I have togoof around with different versions allright there we go wasn't a lowercase B Ithink the lowercase b was an accident Iwant to say it was anaccident anyways there we go I'm goingto copy this oneoh my gosh uh okay dang it so it's gonnamy thing requires me to be a globalistI'm now a globalist I am now officiallyaglobalist globalism all right reallyjust Alex jonesing on this thing allright there we go visualizing branchesuh throughout the rest of this coursewe'll be visualizing branches by the waythis is how git does it as well so ifyou do not know if you go uh man getcommit I believe they have it in commitno uhrebase yeah you'll notice that theyeffectively do this so I TR I tried tocopy a effective version so that wayit's easy to understand easy to see okaysounds good yeah yeah yeah yeah allright let's see this means a branchcalled main with three commits a c isthe most recent commit as you can see Ato B to C Branch there you go so thisone right here means a it splits offfrom a and there's d and e on somethingcalled other branch and B and C on Mainso they are diverging branches with themerge base of a all right everyone getthat I'm going to be using that term alot merge base uh answer the questionsbased on the following diagram whichcommits are part of Lane's Branch uhnone because he's a CEO and doesn't workthese days but it's going to be GH thisone bam got it man I'm so good I'mglobalist all right there we go allright throughout the rest of this courseoh I already answered this one which arepart of commits of main uh it's going tobe a b c d got it firsttry all right VIs izing branches ohwe're doing it again dang we're going todo primes Branch huh primes branch isEFA or a EF EFA man I didn't even getclose you should already be on the mainbranch uh your default branch and youcan always check with get Branch Iwonder if there's a way to name yourdefault Branch something that wouldbreak your system can you do rmrf uh seetwo ways to create a branch right getBranch New Branch name this creates abranch called New Branch uh the thing isI rarely use this uh command yeah Irarely use this command reason being isthat whenever I create a branch I alsowant to switch to that Branch rightright so I typically use get checkout Bjust because that I mean I'm I I guess Iam a boomer it's hard for me to breakthat habit but the newer ones is getswitch C so I'm trying to show you kidsyou youngans to use get switch C allright that's the one you want to do allright I'm just so used to get checkout BI can't help it so if I use get checkoutB sorry I'm old my fossils are creakingyou get the idea okay so what this doesby the way whenever you create a branchit takes your currentlocation and that's where it pointsto allright so when I do this my new branchthat will actually create a new locit'll create it'll have the exact samesha or the exact same uh commit yeahit's your head location so it's it'sgood to know that because a lot ofthat's kind of like one of thoseconfusing jumps people have to make ohyeah on itchy there you go all rightanyway here we go uh create and switchone called ad classic so let's just dothat right now there we go I've createdad Classics uh let's see and then let'ssee run get Branch to verify so I can goget branch and you can see that I'm onad Classics get that and if I go get logyou'll see that I have ab and c and if Igo get log uh main you'll see a b and cthe same thing they're the same thing Ibelieve if I even go like this uh finduh get what is it uh grep refs somethinglike that right you can actually seethis right here so you can see it righthere so if I go right here and I go uhcat that you'll see it's pointed to thisthing and if I cat uh main it's poed tothe samething there you go makes life easy foryou to know these things learning getssucked yeah learning get well it doesn'tit's just it's just time cons it's abunch of little things that you justhave to learn all right switchingbranches uh we talked about using getswitch to change branches there'sanother command you'll certainly runinto and it's been around for a longtime and older developers use it getcheckout okay calling us olderdevelopers hurts a little bit me in thepast me in the past get switch is anewer command that is meant to be moreintuitive and user friendly uh itprobably is more user friendly becauseget checkout is kind of like this grabbag because you can also like check outsides of a merge conflict there's a lotof weird stuff shows thehistory get okay get developers of acertain generation and that's me also uhit's recommended to use get switch overget checkout for simply switchingbranches that's what they say let's okaylet's switch to a branch called Primeall right there we go uh the new way theold way right there you go for thiscourse we'll stick with get switch rightthere we go all right switch to Branchmain run get branch make sure we're onthere switch back to Classics run thisone run this okay I'm not going to dothat yo dog uh I'm happy for you orcongratulations or I'm sorry there we gowe passed I'm not going to switch aroundbut you get the idea it's just getswitched without the- C for createthat's all all right upleveling ourabilities will uh use the ad ClassicsBranch to add a commit to the projectwithout affecting the main branch sowe're going to actually create the Dhere in other words ad Classics Branchwill have all the commits from Main plusa new one all right so we're going toswitch to add Classics we're going tocreate a new file called Classics CSVand there we go so I'm going to go uhVim classics.CSV uh go here I'm going to yank thatbad boy paste it in here of course theclassics uh you know The Princess BrideI actually watch this every Christmasit's literally the greatest movie of alltime here we go all right so we havethis we're going to stage and commit thefile the commit message to start with Dallright run commit okay here we go sowe're going to do that one get add thisget commit Dash D is great there we goand you should be able to see thecommits with the branch with get log wedon't need to do that let's copy thatbad boy paste it in make it happen B bambam bam got it we're all in the goodstuff so let's go over here so we'reabout ready to start get into some goodstuff log flags as you know get log uhshows the history of your uh commits inyour repo there are a few Flags you'dlike to know short full no I like to Idon't really use decorate decoratetypically works well uh if you want tosee where things are coming from so youcan do get log uh decorate full if youwant to see a bunch stuff on Line's theone I use a lot okay this is the one Ialways use because if I go get log youget like all this crap but if I go getlog on line you get that that just feelsnicer right that's the one I want whatthe hell is decorate well this isdecorated right now and the reason whyit's decorated if I'm not mistaken if Igo uh nopager nopager uhno okay there we go all right it's notdoing it effectively decorate itdecorates default default version Ithought I thought there's a way what'sthe way hold on let me go likethis on line uh T out there you go sothere you go that that took it off so ifyou pipe it to another program this iskind like a non-decoratedone a decorated one right here showswhere you're pointing at so head whichis also pointing to add Classics main ison C that's what decorate does so getlog decorate equals no will not tell youanything about where stuff is at doesthat make sense and then you can alsouse git log remember how I talked aboutgraph graph is pretty cool graph uh oneline so you can kind of see that I'mjust going it's just all one line rightnow there's no there's no change rightnow but we'll get to the point where westart seeing some changes don't worrywe'll see it we'll see it uh there we gofantastic I think that's all I need todo run get log with full decoration wealready did all that explain thedecorations let's go we got it we gotthe confetti we're confetti out of ourmind I'm level seven by the way you guyswon't even understand what it's like getpropaganda hour absolutely uh Kung Fu noget Fu remember git stores all theinformation in files in the gitsubdirectory at the roof Ro of yourproject even information about branchesthe heads or tips of the branches arestored in get rep's heads if you c oneof the files in that directory it shouldbe able to see the commit that thehashes points to which we already diduse find and Cat to find the commit hashof your main branch we already did thatone uh what is stored in get ref's headuh one file each for a commit oh what isin there I forget let's see it is goingto be get ref's heads is going to beeach one of the branch names one filefor each branch containing the commithash of that Branch points that onelet's go let's go I'm agenius nope we're not going to watchthis branching and get is practicallyfree and it really is kind of the coreoperation when using git but at somepoint you have to get that work from abranch back into the main line and thisis where merging comes into play now atypical workflow for pretty much everyDev looks like this first we need toupdate our repository to the latest codethis is typically done through get fetchor get we'll cover those more later youBranch off the main branch and give it aname that kind of represents what you'reworking on new feature a you fix the bugcreate the feature update the docks andcreate your one or more commits on thatBranch then finally you merge thosechanges back from your branch into themain line typically when you're at acompany this will involve some sort ofpoll request on GitHub on stash ongitlab but conceptually it's nodifferent than executing git merge onthe command line oh what's the point ofhaving multiple branches you might askthey're most often used to safely makechanges without affecting your or yourteam's primary Branch however onceyou're happy with your changes you'llwant to merge them back into your mainbranch so that they make their way intothe final product all right so here'sthe visual look at this beautiful thingand then notice this this right here iscalled a merge commit it's veryimportant to understand merge commitsbecause if you don't you don'tunderstand why rebase is good so mergecommit and especially when you look at alog we'll look at the log here shortlybut it will actually show you why uh orhow these things kind of exist and whythey're unique and why it allows for loggraph to be very nice uh so hold onlet's see what the assignment is just tomake sure I don't get ahead of myself uhfirst switch back to main next ourcontents file is eerily empty yep updateuh update it to contain this all rightthere we go now the yep and then we'llthis okay perfect perfect let's go allright so what we're going to do is I'mgoing to go like this we're going to getcheck out main oh wait no wait get getswitch add Classics get switch maindon't use checkout we don't use checkoutwe're not using check it out we're notdoing it all right and then update thisfile right here don't you do it uh getstatus it's nice it's not it's not mgitall right there we go so commit uh let'ssee commit the changes with a messagestarting with e all right so let'scommit these changes get add this getcommit uh e uh let's see uh contentssuch contents with a new line at the endwhy I don't know why there we go so nowwe have this one we have ABC uh abc eabc e and ABCD awesome so we should beable to do the whole get loggraph all look at this nice bad boy lookat that look at how graph does that it'snicer in one it's it's nicer in one linehonestly one line you can see right hereso there's ad Classics it's beenbranched off at that point and here'sthis guy so it's a nice way to look atall your stuff there you go why not usecheckout it's just older switch is theone right all right there we gofantastic right so I should be able tojust do that everything should be goodthere we go confetti it out of my mindall right merge commence we are mergingtwo branches together with diverginghistory look at this thing right herethe diverging history simply means thatmain branch the one we branched off ofat Point a has commits and we somebranch have added more commits main hasB andc our Branch some branch has DNAthat means when we merge we need to beable to create a new commit thatrepresents these two diverging historiesas one this is called a merge commit andit's the only commit with two parentsthe process for a merge commit lookslike this first we need to find themerge base the merge base also calledthe best common ancestor is the nearestancestor that is in common to bothbranches and in this case that would bea we then play main Branch's commitsinto a new commit and then we play someBranch into that same commit when allthe changes are in that new commit wecommit it to Main and in this case wecall it f and we give it two parents oneparent pointing to C from the mainbranch and the other parent pointing toE from some Branch if you use G log youwill actually be able to see thediverging from a the two divergingcommits and then the coming backtogether in F merge commands are theresult of just merging two thingstogether yeah so what a merge commitdoes or how a merge works is that whenyou merge in something it takes it findsthe most common ancestor or the mergebasethen it merges Main and this onetogether to make one Super One make onesuper commit adds that to the front ofthe branch that you're on and then hastwo parents which is where you came fromdoes that make sense so if we were tomerge Vim Chads only in main while usingthis we would find the merge base or thebest common ancestor uh in this case areplays those two commits bam creates aspecial commit called a merge commit andthen this thing has two parents thereyou go fantastic right uh so in ourcurrent webflix history we have this wehave main abc e and we have ad Classicswhich is D so when we merge we shouldhave this like we should have an Fcommit that's going to be this littlemerge Branch right here so let's just dothat now get merge ad Classics I assumethat's what we're supposed to do and wewanted to go f so that way we can denoteit there we go we're going to write thatand we just did it perfect right so nowif I do this whole on line decorategraph parents business hell yeah that'sa lot of stuff you can see right hereclassics branched and then came backtogether and you can see right here thatthis is a merged base because it has twoparents or not a merged base sorry uhwhy would I say merch base it's not ait's a merge commit because it has twoparents never worked with two parentschildren yeah most children in get donot have two parents this one does sothere you go this you can actually watchit because this one points to thisCommit This one points to that committhey both point to the same mergebase there you gonow that everybody knows feels goodright a lot of arch users out thereconfused about merge commits all rightso logging has to be one of the besttools in the git belt because git hasextensive logging and observability ifyou need to recover work visuallyunderstand how you got to this pointcommits along the way messages that youhave created where the branches and tagsare including in your repository yourremote repository and of course all thetags that you currently have and muchmore than logging has it let's breakdown a Quick Command right here get logon line graph decorate parents now thislooks like a lot of options but actuallyit'll make a lot of sense once youunderstand what those options mean oneline will give you a condensed view ofyour history first off the hashes areshortened to seven characters which isthe minimum amount get requires for youto specify hash also you get the commitmessage this gives you a nice quick viewso you can can see what happened in thepast graph will draw all the littlelines so you can see exactly how yourcommits have diverged and come backtogether through merges decorate willgive you the branch and tag informationthis can be nice to see how far you'vestraighted away from a branch or where aprevious Branch might be parents willgive you the parent commit upon everyother commit this can be very nice formerge commits because you can see wherethe two parents came from to create themerge commit go ahead give it a tryyourself oh we already did this Ialready kind of explained this beautifulniceness right here uh each Asterrepresents uh a commit in the repositorywe actually already talked about allthis this is fantastic why does thefirst uh line show three commit hashesuh because it's the first commit in thehistory no because it's a merge commitwith three parent commits no becauseit's a merge commit it shows its ownhash and the hash of both of its parentswe already talked about that I thinkthat makes senseright wait where did where did my log gooh I didn't print out the log there yougo you can see these are the commitsright here these are the lines this isits sha and then its parent Sha seethat's parent parent parent parent it'scommit Shaw parent that's its commitShaw this is its parent it's the parentor the shaw it's parent the shaw this isBatman right here no parents beautifulasky beautifulasky there we go all right merge logslet's see you can output your get logdecorate graph parents aside from thehashes look something like this wealready taled well we already did thiswe just got to answer new questions whyis the weird diagram EG all these thingsuh whoopsies I I didn't mean to clickthat it's what happens to your brain onArch Linux after 10 years that's notwhat I wanted to do um it demonstratesthe branching structure three commitswere merged into the main no itdemonstrates adding Classics was mergedinto mainboom that's what it demonstrates it'sbeautiful I want to make sure you guysget it all right a fast forward mergedoes everybody who knows what a fastforward merge is I'm curious type zeroif you don't know what it is I'mactually curious aboutthis well lot ofzeros dang dang that's a lot ofzeros a bit I'm shook I'm shooking rightnow okay the simplest type of uh mergeis a fast forward merge let's say westart with this one main branch and thendelete vs code now we run this on Mainget merge delete vs code because deletevs code has all the commits that Mainehas get automatically fast forwardmerges in other words the best way thebranch you are mergingonto if the tip of that branch is themerge base then you can fast forwardmerge does that make sense yes in otherwords I tried to one more time I triedto that's why I've been trying to saythe word merge base remember a mergebase so for these two commits right herea mer the merge base is this right hereso in this example this one uh this onewas main this one was add Classics sothe merge base was this right here so ifClassics was branched off instead ofsuch contents the merge base is the tipof the branch you are merging ontherefore you there's no Branch right itcan just literally update the pointertheend kind of sounds like rebasing main noit doesn't sound like rebasing mainthat's not what rebasing does we'llexplain what rebasing does in a momentrebasing has nothing to do with mergepeople sometimes goof that up a littlebit it's not what it does um all rightbecause delete vs code has all thecommits main has get automatically doesa fast forward merge it just moves thepointer of the Basse Branch to the tipof the feature Branch that's all it doesbada bing bada boom all right uh we'llget to mer we'll get to rebase hereshortly so you're just adjusting headpointers that's pretty much what you'redoing so when you're doing a a fastforward merge you just main just nowpoints up oneright assignment uh because ad Classicsbranch has been merged into main wedon't need anymore delete that Branchokay we'll delete it uh create a newBranch off of Main update titles uhlet's see add a commit to that branchthat updates titles MD file and addCurious Case of Benjamin Button as thefinal entry in the list and then use Gokay we got to do a couple things herehold on hold on let's delete get a checknot checkout switch de see I I alwaysmess that one update uh titlestitelsuh there we go uh let's just open thisup and go add classic contents what wedoing titles uh Curious case forBenjamin Button is that the one we'redoing titles MD we're going to add TheCurious Case of BenjaminButton there we go we've added it so nowwe have that and then we're going tojust create a commit with G all rightget add this get commit dasg a curiouscase all right there we go uh run oneline to see what we've done here get logone line you can see right here here isupdate titles here's main Main's onebehind you'll notice that this would bethe merge base right so Main iscurrently if I were to merge this ontomain main would also be the merge baseand that's very very important to knowallright so let's go in here let's do oneof these there we go does all thisupdating bada bing bada boom lookinggood looking good confetti let's go allright so fast forward so now what we'regoing to do is we have this diagram andnow all we need to do is just merge itback on so we're going to switch to Mainand we're going to merge update titlesonto it and you'll see what happens hereso get check out main sorry I did checkout not switch get log uh you'll seethat I don't have G on here if I go online it's probably easier to see no G ifI go all you'll see that g does existonly in update titles there we go andthen we can go like this graph andyou'll see right here that g is on theend so it's just straight ahead so nowif I just simply merge get merge uhupdate titles you'll notice that it doesafastforward mergeand now notice if I go like this get logone line notice that this one had abranching Factor this one does notthere's no Branch there's no mergecommit uh and you can see by me goinglike this get um uh parents so you'llnotice that this one is a merge commitbecause it's merging e44 and 7 a0 thisone is not because it's just having itsparent to be one behind very importanttoknow okay that's a very important thingto know people just you know they justdon't know these things all right therewe go I hopefully I did everythingcorrect and I didn't accidentally goforward sometimes I go forward too fastand screw everythingup all right so now we're going to go torebase everybody thinks rebase is themost awful thing ever and it's onTwitter if I go to Twitter I guaranteeyou I search up the word get rebase andthere's going to be something awful upat the top get rebase or hopefully it'sgoing to be me saying people don'tunderstand it all right mer all righthere we go there you go look at that seeopen Slack someone help with rebasebranch in Flames sends thoughts andprayers close the slack go to gym rebaseForcepush I up I get rebase like lookat this it's just it's an endless supplyHacker News is having a get rebasediscourse again I like this Comon a lotsee it uh blot the blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah blah again theyhate this one I think this is the wayokay personal opinion rebase is tightrebase is the only way to do itsomething about get rebase thanks yallfor coming I don't even get this oneokay I don't even get this one this onemust be get rebase this is get rebase soyou got to be careful when you'rerebasing okay you could screw up theworld I just want you to know that okayyou could screw up the world rebasemight just be one of the mostmisunderstood features of git where thefear typically kind of comes from isthat somebody changes the history of apublic branch and when I say publicBranch I mean a lot of people rely onthis Branch for their repos as well andof course when they pull and the changeshave been somehow altered in the pastall these conflicts and these weird giterrors start happening and it justcauses a disaster for everybody and theneveryone says rebase is terrible I willnever use that only use merge well skillissues you used it wrong to understandrebase you simply need to understand itsprimary use case rebase helps you totake the diverging commits from onebranch and move them to the tip of thebase branch that the feature branch isbased on now that sounds like a mouthfulbut it's actually pretty simple so takethis graph right here we have twobranches Main and Feature Featurebranches from Main at commit a and Maingets B and C added to it while thefeature branch has d and e now we wantto be able to take the feature branchand get those changes from Main now withyour current knowledge you wouldprobably merge main into featurecreating a merge commit and that doeshave consequences and we'll discuss moreabout that in part two but for now let'sfocus on rebase rebase is is going toallow you to move forward feature Branchfrom diverging at Point a up todiverging off of Point C allowing for afast forward merge if you wish to get itback into Maine this also allows you tomaintain a merge commit free history andagain there are some consequences forthat and they can be quite nice and thatis it you'll notice this gives you theopportunity to do a fastforward mergeand kind of have a free of merge commithistory this will allow for someAdvanced G features to be more easilyusable if you maintain this type ofworkflow okay so rebase is very verysimple all rebase does is update whereyour branch points to this is well okayI mean technically there's actually acouple different use cases for rebasebut let's just start here this is thefirst one so pretend we had Main and wehad feature Branch if we were to getrebase main on our feature Branch itwould take the pointer which is whichit's parent pointer it's its merge uhbase is pointing at a and it's going togo all the way to C then replay yourcommits d and e and now you have alinear history which means you can do afastforward merge okay so it's actuallyreally really simple and you'll noticethat DNE even though the commit messageis the same you will now get new commitShaws why would you get a new commitShaw well that's because D its parent isno longer a it's C so therefore D has anew sha e has a new sha because D has anewsha now you have to fix all theconflicts if there was a conflict whilerebasing there would be a conflict whilemerging if you're if you're experiencingcontinual conflicts it's because youdon't know what you're doing and I willexplain why in a little bitokay okay buddy can you calm down againwhenever I see some whenever I seesomebody say something about all theseconflicts and all this stuff with uhwith rebase what it makes me realize isyou don't know what rebase does and howto and how to get around stuff so itjust moves the merge base exactly itjust moves the merge base and that'sreally important do you talk aboutconflicts and G two yes so git one isall about using git for yourself get twois all about using it for a team so ittakes the code from d and e and appliesthem to uh code version C yes soliterally so the exact operations of getmer rebase does this so let's say we'reon feature branch and we say get rebaseuh main what happens is that we checkout main I'll call that the targetBranch we check out TargetBranch we then take Source branch andapply its commits to the tip of TargetBranch then we update Source Branch topoint to the new uh to the new tip whyis it uh important to change basis uhreverting so people really hate getrevert it does make things better whenyou need need to revert so revertstypically happen in larger companies ifyou're just working with like two orthree people you're probably never goingto revert anything and that's fine butif you have say a 100 people working onthe same repo and there is a test thatneeds to go out that day and youaccidentally screw up Main and you needto unscrew up Main and they can't waitfor you to go okay this is going to takeme a couple days to fix you have torevert your commit out of the historyand then you have to re-release intoproduction the reason that's nice if youproperly do what I consider the best wayto use git which is to always rebaseright so here's ABC you always rebasesuch that you can do Fast Forward mergesand whenever you do this youuh you take this and you merge it into asingular commit right you squash it iswhat's that called is that if you runinto a situation where you need to userevert or revert I always I never knowhow to I never know how to say the wordrevert in that kind of tense uh or inthat kind of sense I always call itrevert I never I don't know what to dohere anyways when you do this it then isreally easy to remove this right alwaysrebase in local branch I rebase inpublic okay that's crazy don't rebase inpublic you can also fast forward mergetoo yeah just do it with idea that's nota good way to do things I'm justthrowing it out there knowing how gitworks and setting it up so that it canbe very easy to change things but uh butbut sometimes I just commit a just a lotof commits you should you should commitearly and often okay this is a good wayto do things committing early and oftenis great do that but do you lose commithistory when squashing it depends youloose your history of your local changesand that's okay you can do that you cansquash them down to a single one so thatway when you merge back into the mainbranch the public Branch it's just onecommit now maybe you want those in twocommits if you want them in two commitsthen squash the commits into the twoones that you want maybe you want themin all the commits then keep them allright you can kind of choose what youwant to do cuz when you revert you cando the same thing as you do in cherrypick and provide a list of Shaws to liketake out or put back in uh get rebaseinteractive is the best thing that isget rebase interactive is very very niceand we'll do that for when we'resquashing right why would you go withinteractive rebase and squash yourcommits into a single one instead of uhmerging with a squash uh I do thatthat's how I do it so locally wheneverI'm about to do anything I get all mycommits prepared I rebaseI squash and I push things up try makingyes we can do this too uh this is onegood way to do things but we're going toget to that that's later on right I'mnot trying to we're trying to stay ontask here okay lot of questions rebaseis always a lot of questions becauserebase gets the biggest bad RP from theinternet and most people have absolutelyno gosh dang idea what rebase does andso then they're like oh but rebase isbad because it'll screw up your historyand you're like you're right you can youcan f yourself up with rebase absolutelyyou can chop off your finger with askill saw it doesn't mean skill saws arebad it just means you should probablyknow how to use a skill saw before youjust start slanging that blade allaround right I know that's crazy bothrebase and merge can be used tointegrate changes from one branch intoanother in some sense yes very very trueanyways all right rebase versus merge BLblah blah blah we're going to do thisone uh blank can add additional uhcommit and blank does not rebase mergecan add an additional commit rebase doesnot correct so if I'm rebasing andthere's never conflicts can I still losehistory for months go so I'm not surewhat you mean by losing history peoplesay that cuz they don't know what itmeans what are you attempting to say ifyou have history that's in a publicBranch you will not change it unless ifyou interactively squash rebase and thenForce push which if you do that you're abad person you should be fired that'scrazy don't ever do that you will youwill actually ruin everybody's life youactually will yes conflicts happenwhether if there's a conflict whilerebasing there's a conflict whilemerging that's a good good thing tounderstand nobody wants to see millionsee see your millions of commits justsquash it yeah a lot of people preferthe squash all right we need a newBranch uh feature branch and to be ableto practice our rebase we want to notinclude some of the commits in recentmain uh we're going to use get switchcommand and create and switch to a newlocal branch called update Dune butBranch off the decommit you can supply acommit hash directly and get switch sowe're going to do this right here we'regoing to get switch Branch it off ofDune okay people so we're going to golike this get log uh on line and therewe go so D is that bad boy right hereget uh switch dasc update Dune and fromthat one there we go I said update doneyou get the idea so if I do that anotherlittle oneliner right here we're goingto see this beautiful part right here ifwe do on line all you'll see that headis pointed right here update Dune I'mclose enough it's not my fault I didn'tcopy pasta what can you do okay so nowthat you see that this is good this isgood good good good good stuff there wego we're going to paste that in weshould bewaitwhat oh update okay it's actuallyrequiring me to do that get Branch M upuh update uh done to updateDune I don't know why you got to be likethat get boot Dev okay you can't let aman have oopsy daisies here so you neverpush until your feature is done or youneed the force push yeah I I don't Idon't I don't push my features upregularly I keep them and I commit themand I get everything I want and then Ipush it up and then there's some thereis some there is some a little bit ofstyle points here of how you want tohandle things after that some peopledon't like to makechanges uh some people don't like tomakechanges in the sense of having to forcepush again so all PR changes will becometheir own um commits and then squashthat one more time and then merge itwhen it's ready that's one way or youcan merge your PR changes back into asingle commit and and then you have toforce push it so it's kind of like yougot to Riz get your own way and somepeople prefer the you know the the prchanges to be their own separate commitssome people don't that's the rizing partyou know also if you have really shittycicd pipelines you may find yourselfconstantly you know doing that and getForce push every five minutes withamending draft commit yeah that's mecalled using get we've all seen thatwe've all seen it where it's just a wallof test test test test test test testtest test test test test test test testit's just the worst yeah I get a badfeeling when not pushing for severaldays okay I I mean that's fine you canhave of either no one's telling you notto it happens it is kind of weird rightI feel bad not pulling I like to pullprettyregularly all right so now we're goingto rebase main this will do thefollowing check out main remember Icalled that Target Branch replay onecommit at a time from J diesel onto Mainupdate J diesel Branch support to thelatest commit the rebase does not affectMaine while J diesel has all of its uhhad all the changes from Main there yougo so it's going to pull in thosechanges so our assignment let's add twocommits to Dune Branch add the followingquotes to Dune the spice must flow andthen for that will be H and this mindkiller all right let's do this okay Duneis a really good movie okay I don't carewhat you guys say allright wait spice must flow okaygood uh get status so you can see thatget add this get add this get commitDash I think it's huh spice me daddy why not uh go intohere that was H we're going to do I grabthat one go back in here do that savethat add getcommit fear me Daddy I think so I thinkthat's right I think we just got it okayso I should be able to get log and seethis thing so there we go you can seethat right here in fact I can go likethis graph would make it nicer so youcan see right now that I've branched offofD you can see my little Branch off of dright here that goes up and does uh doesthis right here H and I there it isright so you can see the branch righthere this is the mainline This is the uh the new line thatwe're doing what is dash all it it listsevery last Branch right so if you tolist every last Branch you can I believeyou can also forgive me if I get thiswrong I believe I can also go Main andupdate Duneright you can also specify whichbranches you would like to see how theydo what is happening with that herelet's take a look at that so you'llnotice right here if you remember thisright here was when we did our merge Bour our merging and all that fun stuffright so this has update titles and Mainpointing right here do I need to I don'tthink I deleted update titles did I didI forget to delete update titles getBranch delete update titles are you sureyou want to delete it Force get the hellout of here allright allright there wego so you can kind of watch this thingmove right so there there was rememberwe had a split at one point right herethat had DNE so this is the merge commitfromDNE so if I go here I forgot to doparents this will make it more clear soyou can see right here this is the mergecommit for from uh which one is that onefrom E and D that's the one we createdearlier this right here is our currentOne update Dune so you can kind of seeeach one of the lines forming and wesplit off uh we split off on D righthere so the split went up this way to Hand I so it goes i h d CBA a for updateDune and for main line is going to beGF e D or is that or actually it's goingto be gfd eCBA I believe that's how that that's theordering there you go that's that's howyou read it you read it from top tobottom left to right classic real realclassic right there all rightPerfect all right we're going to dothose two things we have those oneswe're going to run one line I like minewhere I did run line main you can seehere's a more graphical depiction of itall right you can see that so now ourgoal here is to rebase it and so we'regoing to have uh does it tell us torebase it I can't tell finally whilestill on that we want to rebase orchange it so when we rebase them you'llnotice right now here let's go back tothis thing you'll notice that we Branchoff of D for I and H so when I go likethis get rebase Main and reexecute thisyou'll notice it got a lot moresimple we are now right here it's nowbranched off of G which makes it into anice linear history all right we justmoved our Branch forward you'll alsonotice oh I I didn't I didn't save theoutput or else you'd see that the thestuff all changed there you go prettystraightforward right there you go noconflicts why would there be a conflictwe edited different files so rememberconflicts will happenuniversally since we do not have aconflict in a merge we're not going tohave it in the rebase pretty much eitheruh there might be some Edge case wherethat's not true but I can't think of whythat would ever be true because aconflict in its core happens because githas three operations add deletemodify and so if two operations modifythe same line it can't do it it doesn'tknow how to merge those two thingsbecause git operates on a line by linebasis it does not operate within codebecause once you operate within code ithas to understand the intent of code andtherefore it can't so therefore it'sgoing to say hey since I can'tunderstand the intent of code you'vemodified the same line you need to dosomething about it I don't know how todo something about this does that makesense all right the advantage of mergeis that it preserves the true history ofthe project this is true you know whereall the branches happened and where allthe merge commits happened it it showswhen branches were merged and where onedisadvantage that it can create a lot ofmerge commits which can make historyharder to read and understand which canalso make it harder to manipulatehistory with uh reverts and reverts canbe a strategy especially in biggercompanies I had the revert at Netflixprobably 10 times in my life right it'sreal I've had to do it comments cancause conflicts I've don't know about ohcomments as in comments and code yescomments and code yes a linear historyis generally easier to read understandand work with some teams enforce theusage of one uh of one or the other ontheir main branch but generally speakingyou'll be able to do whatever you wantwith your own branches it's true howpainful was it not painful at all uhwhen it came to that because I alwaysdid I always did the same stuff I nevermerge committed I always did all mystuff really nice and made sure I had asingle commit so whenever I had torevert which did happen uh all I did wasjust revertcommit revert commit walked away righteasy easypeasy right warning you should neverrebase a public Branch like Maine if youdo this you will destroy your life andwhat I mean by that is when someonepulls it will say your histories are outof sync and then you'll have this hugeconflict problem and then you have toeffectively undo everything uh it'sgenerally good maners to rebase a publicBranch onto your own personal branch allright hold on rebase a public Branchonto your personal Branch that's kind ofa confusing question I think what it'ssaying is rebase a public branch andchange its history if that's the case nothat's bad there you go rebase and getmerge are different tools all right wealready talked about this it's generallyokay to merge changes into your own uhprivate Branch or to rebase your branchon top of a public Branch yes this is[Music]correct all right undoing changes one ofthe major benefits of git is the abilityto undo changes there are a lot ofdifferent ways to do this but firstwe'll start by going back a commithistory without uh without discardingchanges allright we have a little story you guysready for a little bit of a story Idon't even merge I just pull damn it'scrazy why would you do that let's seeokay the new internet webflix tried toadd his favorite movie to the titlesfile but overwrite the entire file bymistake to simulate that on update DuneBranch go ahead and overwrite titleswith just one line The Internship ohVince Von oh Vince vaugh allright I don't know why thathappened I think that's what they'relooking for oh he actually doesn't evenwant that he want the entire file overedthere we go that's what that means ifyou're wondering this just meansredirect output but it redirects outputand destroys the file double carotredirects output and appends to thefiles all right make sure the file ischanged by running get status and thencommit with-j all right uh get add thisget commit J interns am Iright there wegofantastic am I right am I right am Iright all right get reset is a commandthat can be used to undo the lastcommits or any changes in the index bythe way I use reset quite a bit okay notjust soft either also hard but softactually soft reset is an amazing thingto use and it becomes exceptionally goodwhen you screw up a revert cherry pickor a rebase and so it becomes reallygood the get reset soft I know some ofyou some of you prefer hard but hardisn't always good okay it's not it's youcan't go hard all the time you got to gosoft sometimes trust me on this one I'llshow you all right get reset command canbe used to undo the last commits or anychanges into the uh to the index stagedbut not committed changes and the worktree unstaged and not committed changesso we can do re get reset commit hash orit it really shouldn't be commit hashhere this is kind of a oopsy daisies itshould be committes commit is a termused by get to say something that lookslike a commit so it's some sort of hashor something that can be calculated intoahash right uh the D- soft option isuseful if you want to go back a previouscommit but keep all of your changescommitted changes will be uncommittedand staged while uncommitted changeswill remain un are staged or unstaged asbefore so our current branch is righthere it should be a commit J now weshould be able to go to commit I um bydoing a soft reset so I can go like thisuh get reset soft now normally it's saidto go uh in here and go get log one lineand go and grab I and do this right hereand go and get reset I you don't have todo that you can also go if it's directlyin history you can go get reset soft andgo head which is where I'm pointing toand then the amount of steps you want togo back so I want to go head one back sothat's going to be to I there we go wedid a reset soft that if I go like thisget status you'll see that I have thetitles get diff uh staged you'll seethat I've deleted everything forinternship uh get diff you can seethere's no changes uh no uncommittedchanges to the work tree and if I go getlog one line-1 you'll see that I amcurrently on I pretty cool right so Ijust did I undid those changes whilemaintaining the changes available if youdon't see why this is useful in rebaseI'll show you later okay don't worrywe'll show you we'll showyou yeah it's good huh I like it I meanI personally like that there we go uh Jshould be gone for the commit log therewe go we should run thisthing yes uh yeah git log uh G log uhget oh my goodness I showed this earliergit log p on line is is really nice toouh on line-1 cuz it'll show you theprevious changes so you can see fear'sthe mind killer that was definitely Iyou can see that right there I'm more ofa mixed kind of guy okay okayinterestinginteresting I can't really arguethat can you justkeep oh dang I was hoping I could getmore I was hoping I could get more uhget add- P do you use this no I never doI never do patch stuff I never do any ofthat interactive adding honestly it'sthat so this right here I woulddefinitely use with an editor it's wayway nicer um I've never used I've neverused uh that no I've never used thatyeah if you're going to do patch addingso uh get or um uh man get add uh daspright this is interactively choose Hun'sthe patch so hunk I don't know how theydetermine the size of ahunk uh but hunks uh is just likesomewhat of a change so long as there'senough lines between two changes it goesuh here you go here's hunk one here'shunktwo and therefore you can actually say Iwant to add this one but remove that onebut if we do it with interactive itactually makes it a lot easier here I'lldo it really quickly okay I'm going todo it really quicklyokay there we go uh let's just there wego that's good enough uh let's bring itright up into the middle I'm going tojust go in here we're going to go inhere I I know I'm screwing things up whocares uh's let's just go like thisremoveme right there we go I'm going to removeme so now when I go in here I canactually go like this I'm going to addone up to the top and one to the bottomand when I go in here you'll notice thatthere's two hunks those are hunks rightthere so if I were to go uh get add uhthat- P you'll notice it's like hey doyou want to Stage this particularhunk no I'd much rather personally go inhere and go like this and so I can go Iwant to Stage that one and I want toremove this one now I only have onechange it's much easier to use agraphical editor for that stuff split isuseful split is useful yeah so anywaysall right let me just undo that one uhand then go in here and go get reset uhsoft so now here's a problem here's aproblem everybody I goofed up right nowI have this commit that isn't quiteright and all that I bet we could findthe other commit couldn't we oh we couldbut we're not going to we're not goingto uh get status there we go get diff uhstage there you go you can see all thestuff I've added to it that's fine allright so get uh hard will undoeverything so get hard will not onlyundo the changes and move your branchback it will also clear out your indexand your working tree assignment get runstatus to confirm this one uh run getreset hard to undo the changes don'tmove on before you've done this okaythere we go so I can go like this getresethard uh cat titles this now you'llnotice everything's good there we go soI did a reset hard which willchange which will undo the index and theworkingtreeso like changes that are unstaged sothat is not no because un well unstageyes it does unstage so it just dependsso watch this so if I go like this uhlet's go likethis I'm gonna add a line right getstatus this is an unstaged change to theworking tree get reset hard get statusit's gone very important but so if I uhget back here but if I CLI this Foo andI say Foo get status this is anuntracked change very very important sowhen I get reset hard get status you'llnotice that the untracked change becauseit hasn't added my working tree yet thisis an unknown file it does not get resethard important to understandthat okay important to understand thosethings there we go we did all that let'sgrab that let's paste thatin untrack get so fun with get ignore itcan be very annoying with get ignore yesuh there we go danger I want to stresshow dangerous this commit or thiscommand can be if you were to simplydelete a committed file it would betrivially easy to recover because of theuh it is tracked in get however if youuse get reset hard to undo committingthat file it would uh it would bedeleted for good yes you can delete byaccident forever so if you have a changethat you never committed you have anunstaged change hanging out and you do aget reset hard you can lose all of itvery important to be careful about thatso be careful about doing that okay becareful reset to a specific commit ifyou want to reset back to a specificcommit you can use get reset hardcommand to provide that and you have toprovide a hash this will reset yourworking uh directory and index to thestate of that commit and all changesmade after that are lostokay so this is this isn't technicallytrue uh I don't this must have escapedmy eyeballs but they're not technicallylost forever you can still recover themvia uh ref log or by looking at uh youcan you can peruse through a lot of theG stuff and you can cherry pick back inthis is true but it can be a bit of apain in the ass to do that right againbe super careful in part two of thecourse we'll cover more advanced stuffuh ref log has saved me many times itshould ref log is very very good getreset hard blank undoes the commitchanges delete uh deleting the changesforever unfortunately that is not sureI'm not sure how that escape me itperceiving deletes them forever itremoves the changes from your branch andmoves your branch head so it appearsthat they never existed you can stillget them right anyways I want to stressoh let's see hold on when provided ahash get reset hard blank moves yourcurrent Branch back to an older commitand destructively discards uncommittedchanges correctthere you[Music]go all right get remote uh often our FRofies read co-workers make code changesthat we need to begrudgingly accept intoour pristine bug free repos this iswhere distrib uh distributed in thedistributed Version Control System comesfrom we can have remotes which are justexternal repos which mostly the same getrepo history as our local one all rightthat's the nice part it's a distributedVersion Control System right you get youget the idea uh when it comes to git theCLI tool there really isn't a centralrepo GitHub is just someone else's repoonly by convention and convenience havewe as developers started to use GitHubas a source of Truth for our code soGitHub is just is just another versionof your repo and that's very importantconnection to make because if you don'tyou might find yourself fairly confusedby a lot of stuff let's create a secondrepo called webflix local and let's seeas a sibling directory to our originalwebflix so we'll do a little CD blahblah blah blah so I'm going to go makederb back webflix uh webflix local therewe go all right let's see run and submitthe CI test from inside this one oh weneed to get AIT to create a new emptyrepo all right uh let's go like thislet's CD back back webflix local get AITjump in here jump over here paste thatin all right we're moving we're movingfast adding a remote and get anotherrepos called a remote the standardconvention is that when you're treatingthe remote as the authoritative sourceof Truth such as GitHub you would nameit origin there's also some like basicrules around origin that can be appliedthere's some convenience defaults andall that by authoritative source ofTruth we mean that it's one uh one youand your team treat as the true repoit's the one that contains the mostup-to-date version of the accepted codesome people call it Upstream Upstreamcan be kind of unique uh if you do yourrepo so this depends on your uh workingorder some people will have Upstream ina different fashion um so then origin ifyou're working in a bigger team you'lloften find that origin is your fork ofthe of the remote and Upstream is theauthoritativeone Upstream there yougo does that make sense it's good tokind of know this and you you'll seethis often uh origin is typically theone you uh work with and so if you're ona small teamworking by yourself youdon't need to do this this would be kindof stupid you just need this uh youdon't need to create a bunch of processfor no reason but you do want Upstreamwhen there is a lot of people workingthat's when it makes sense Upstream isusually when you're working from a forkin common F yes yes uh There He Go isthat on top of branching yes a remote isarepository right so so we're going to dothat right here so here's the Syntax foradding a remote and it can be a URIremember a UR URI is very very importantto know that so what we're going to dois we're going to go like this getremote add origin back up webflixremember a remote is just another repothere's nothing that says says it can'tbelocal okay it's good to know that cuzsometimes people think remotes are onlyavailable like on GitHub it's not trueit's not true it's not true anywaysoopsies I ACD went back all right let'sgo forward there we go let's copy thisone all right so let's copy this thingthere we go we have our remote POS uhproperly set so we can fetch adding aremote to our get repo does not mean weautomatically have all the content so ifI go like this get log you'll knowthere's nothing here nothing ain't therefetch brings in all the changes this isvery important so if I go fetch it'sgoing to bring in all the changes thisis fantastic right so if I go like thisget log not look what happened look whathappened look at it would you look at itnothing's happened right well the reasonwhy nothing has happened is because wedidn't actually update our stuff andthat's important it didn't update ourbranches yet this is good to know thisis very very good to know and so we canalso go in our get objects and we canfind things so I can go like this get uhI can go uh findget uh let's just find and get you'llsee that up here you'll see a lot ofthese things right in here and you'll beable to recognize some of these thereshould be a 78 right a 78 in here thereyou go there's our first one right therethat's our first commit that's commita if I'm not mistaken7805 uh get cat cat file-p785 look at that look at thata how nice is that huh get fetch moneyit's like it's like it's for free okayso there you go so you can see that wehave all of our commits they're just notintegrated yet so that's important it'simportant to understand that thathappens there we go fantastic so now weactually need to uh you know we need todo something about it now bringing theremote uh into this we need to run getfetch oh I apparently I did thatapparently I uh apparently this oneis it didn't actually check to see if Idid a fetch first easy I ran ahead I ranahead I ran a little too fast okay I rana little too fast all right todemonstrate this run get log which wealready did we actually already did allthat I'm sorry I ran sofast all right I can't help it so lookat this beautiful thing we can actuallydo this right here you can actually loga remote Branch versus uh versus theorigin like we can actually you can seethe differences between them as long aswe've fetched and did all that so prettypretty exciting time so I can go uh soif I go get log doesn't work get logmain nothing really in there if I goorigin main you'll see all thesefantastic absolutelybeautiful uh oh did I actually screw upour uh I think I might have screwed upour stuff no I didn't all right let's golet's go I'm a genius I'm an actualgenius allright all right merge we can mergebranches with a single uh local repo sowe can actually merge in the remoteBranchyeah yeah exciting what music is playingthe music that is playing is going to bebits and something what is it bits andhits which is this is Skyrim but Loi youare a genius I'm not sure about thatokay uh can you explain the differencebetween branches and UpstreamOrigins origin or remotes so the secondpart of your question are called remotesremotesoh this guy's being really annoying herehold on there you go you're bannedforever from YouTube I don't know how toundo it so if I don't click this buttonit's done it's forever uh dang it justit literally just left sucks to suck allright uh these are called origins or notOrigins these are called remotes nowremotes are justreposbranches well they're branches they'rejust they're just pointers to to uhcommit within a repo and so there's abig difference there so an a repo cancontain many branches and they don'thave to be the same set ofbranches branches are just pointers tocommits does that make sense so again aremote would be or a repo is just acollection of commits a branch is just apointer to a commit it's a mutablepointer to a commit a tag is anon-mutable pointer to a bit uh acommit it took me a couple times to getthat right GitHub is just one large gaterepo that's all it really is it reallyis just one large gate repo they do alot of really crazy things so all rightso now let's merge this stuff in so I'mgoing to go like this get merge uhorigin uh main so I'm going to merge themain origin into my origin right here uhso if I go get log now you'll see allthe beautiful stuff this Curious Case ofBenjamin Button everything's lookingreal real nice fantastic so I'm going togo like that I'm going to grab thatwe're going to grab this bad boy inconfetti time[Music]yes there is no so this idea of localand remote it's it's remember git is adistributed Version Control one repo isnot somehow the authoritative source andanother repo the downstream Source everyevery repo is its own repo running andyou're sinking between them so you canactually have many authoritative reposit's just typically to make life supereasy you have one which is GitHub andthen you pull and push that so everybodycan pull and push to the same thing doesthat make sense there we go all rightGitHub blah blah blah blah so rememberGitHub is not git is not GitHub GitHubis a product by Microsoft git is asource control GitHub is a way forMicrosoft to make money and to scrapeyour data and to collect it all for theAI in which it's attempting to createJunior Engineers that cost less butstill cost a lot and then to uh and thento use that to get companies to pay themyeah okay now that we understand whatgithub's purpose is which is to stealyour data that's why they give you freefree repos now let's look at this allright AI alert yeah create a GitHubaccount we already did this oneassignment all right run all checksensure that your GitHub user exists andis authenticated there we go I alreadyhave it I already have it authenticatedand all that fun stuff so there we goall right get up repo just like wecreated webflix local repo and usewebflix as a remote GitHub makes it easyto create remotes that are hosted ontheir site all right perfect we cancreate a new repo so hold on before wedo that I got to go like this GitHub theprimin web flick I believe it should bethere or did I name it something else Ididn't name it anything so what I'mgoing to doheresettings let me go all the way down tothe Bippitybottom delete this suppository I want todelete it uh I have read theinstructions uh the primagen SL webflixthere we go delete this one holy cow I'mgoing to need to do I'm going to need togive a stool sample after this to reallyget everything done whoopsy daisieswrong thing there we go do that thingall right assignment so I may have todarken my screen for this because Idon't know if I have to type and stuffcreate a new repository on GitHub calledthis okay let's do that right now uh goon here actually I can just go righthere create new repository let's call ita web Flix there we go select owner theprim engine there we go create go herewe have a new remote right therefantastic lookinggood oh no we have too many tabs openall right authenticate your uh local Gconfiguration with your GitHub account Irecommend installing the GitHub CLI withone quick installation I already havethat uh GH authoriz authorization andthen do that one let's see which one arewe doing thatin let's seeadd a remote in your webflixrepo there rep points that one okay sothat's webflix get remote add origin forwebflix which is right here there we gobe sure to place your username and doget LS remote to make sure it's all donecorrectly get a uh LSremote there we go I just have that badboy right there do I need to push up mychanges I don't think I need to push upmy changes it doesn't seem like I haveto push up my changes but we'll find outyay I don't have to push up my changesall right so there we go get push originmain all this does is pushes up yourbrancheschanges to the remotes right so I canactually so with webflix local I canactually push into webflix and sotherefore from webflix I can push intothe remote um so here just to just toshow you that I go like this get Branchuh getswitch uh we'll call it Foo and go getpush origin Fu there there we go so if Igo back to this guy I can go get branchand you'll notice fu is now there Fu wasjust pushed up from one remote into thenext that's all we're doing is I'mpushing it to a repo and you can putpermissions and all that on what can bedone and blah blah blah blah blah that'swhat that's uh that's what it does sothere you go the GitHub is not like thatcrazy complicated in that sense it'sjust git the crazy part about GitHub isall the managing and making it scale andall that other stuff uh get Branch uhdefu there we go all rightall right what do we got to dohere do I got to push up all my stuffyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah getpush originmain there we go I push my main throwthat in there run all checks confettiout of my mind there we go have wegotten to rebasing yet we went past thebasic rebasing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahlet's see pull H fetching is nice butmost of the time we actually want thefile changes yeah there we go we can gopull remote Branch we already did thatin webflix and so if we were to do thisagain uh we'd be able to do it uh fromyou know up from the remote let's useGitHub UI to commit a change to our repoand then pull it down navigate to GitHubuh navigate to Classics uh edit thisfile add a newline allright so we're going to do this righthere watch this one this is going to bea little bit wild we're going tonavigate to Classics we're going to editthis one by hand we're going to throwthat in right there we're going tocommit changes and how do we want tocommit these changes I want to make sureI have the correct name just in case topull the let's see holdon Commit the changes but uh add themessage J update classic vs okay therewego J commit changes boom committed outof my mind allright let's go commit the change usingthe UI okay we did that on your commandline make sure you're on Branch mainmerge the changes from update d okay soget check out main get merge uh updateDune there we go uh get run get pullorigin which will pull in the mostRegent recent command all right get pulluh origin main there it goes it P pulledit in oh no I have divergingbranches por Maria I'm not supposed tohave merging branchesyet this not supposed to happen oh mygosh I have diverging branches I wasmessing around too much and now look atme now look at me I'm 4 foot2 exactlythis is where I give up ah it's not thatbad all right so this isn't too bad sooh you should also do this oh did I uhdid I do that let's see if you if if youget diverging branches run get configpull rebase false make sure get will uhmerge on poll and try again so getstatus so there we go so if I go likethis get config uh list uh GPrebase do I not have it weird I thoughtI did did I not have that on uh getconfig add local uh rebase what is it isit pole rebase pole rebasefalse it's like I planned I pre-plannedfor this there we go beautifulright beautiful can we agree with that Idid do I I actually probably deleted itby accident there we go now I have anice merge now I have a merge commitwhich we you know jeez and so we got amerge commit with a K there we gothere we go we did all that one uh makesure everything worked with get log online uh get log on line there we go a bCDE e f g h i jk there we go there's my main rightthere isn't that nice little annotationsby the way origin that's where myorigin's at or at least where I think myorigin's at this is where I'm at this iswhere my update do at there we goperfect first commit was in fact not batman pretty poor move on my behalfhonestly not naming my first commitBatman it's really the way you got to doit oopsies I forgot to do this uhassignment switch to a new branch calledad Classics my bad add another line thisone okay we'll do uh get switch C uh addClassics this stuff is kind of easy Idon't think there's anything veryinteresting here that's going on that'swhy we're kind of just moving ratherquickly we're going to do a poll requestif you've never done a poll requestthey're really not they're not hard atall they're very very simpleoh my eyeballs there wego by the way did was I supposed to no Idon't think Iwas I don't think I was anyways I justwant to make sure I didn't goof upanything all right there we go so we'regoing to do this thing we're going toadd the classics um let's see uhClassics there we go Alfred hitch hokhitch hitch HW Hitchcock Hitchcock uhget status have the classics what do wewant to call this thing this is an Lwe're going to take the L get add thisget commit sorry this this part I I Imean I maybe some people are you know uhfind this stuff uh they don't know howthis stuff works to me it's very veryboring right have you ever if youhaven't done any of this stuff it's veryvery simple and you're going to do thiscan you do a PO request directly in gitwell poll requests are something ofgithub's more nature so we're going tobe doing a a poll request you can usethe GitHub tools you can't do itdirectly from that because git does notknow about GitHub if that makes senseall right so there we go we did all thatand so now I just simply need to pushthe new Branch at the GitHub navigate toGitHub do a pull request click new polarrequest set the base Branch to this oneadd Classics we want to merge this onecreate the polar request but don't mergeit yet there we go very very simple sojump in here get push origin ad Classicsnotice that I do get push remote Branchyou don't technically have to do that ifyou set uptracking Alfred hitch HWinteresting comparethere we go add classics classics goesinto main create porequest bada bing bada boom look at thisbeauty right here you can see these twothings because we're not quite up todate with all thestuff I'm not reading chat chat isunhinged today absolutely unhinged allright there we go run all checks lookinggood absolutelyunhinged all right my workflow well onthis topic of whole request I want toshare uh my 90% of the time uh and alllet's see I keep all my serious projectson GitHub that way if my computerexplodes I have a backup and I see andif I if I'm ever on another computer Ican just clone the repo this is true uhI configured my git to rebase by defaultthat's why we had that you know thiswhat I do uh rather than merge so I keepa linear history right I like the linearhistory because I just part of what I'vealways done is I always have this astrue it's just you know I it's hard forme not to get config um let's seelocal uhunset local what is it it's poll. rebasethere wego uh that's this is what I do I just dothis I do very simple stuff when I'mworking by myself I just add my changesand push it up you know I think whenyou're when you're working by yourselfyou don't need to practice all thegreatest things because it doesn'treally matter right uh when I do my teamworkflow I go on here and I do the adand I make sure I rebra everything and Imake sure it's all the ways exactly theway I want it to be and I do all thatand then I do the the merging is it agood practice to add it to the global uhI I added to local because I wantedlocal Behavior here I don't like to dothings on the global scope if it'ssomething I don't want done foreverything since I wanted to turn offrebase I didn't want to put it globallyon in case I forgot to turn it off rightso if I go get config global globallist Global list we're GL we're damnGlobal list there we go uh re re-enabledsee I got to turn that off see I don'teven have it up on here see I must Imust have deleted it on axent get configuh add Global uh poll rebaserebase true there we go push on Save ofcourse yeah it's one of those thingsthat's really hard to REM it's why I tryto do whenever I'm doing things likethis I do it to the local as opposed tothe global because I always end upeffing stuff up just like that I I Itake off all these things and I forgetto add stuff delete my feature Branchrepeat yep there you go so you know thatwhen working solo do I use manydifferent branches in pquest workflow noI don't I think it's a waste of timepersonally I think it's it's a hugewaste of time my workflow while let'ssee while the topic of PLL request Iwant to share oh I did this all rightwhen working with the team uh yea Forcepush no work on a branch feature Branchthen open a poll request for reviewthat's how I do it just makes senseright so if you ever want to commit toopen source you obviously need the forkyou need to uh create a pull request youneed to do all that stuff rightget ignore is really really reallyreally really important becauseobviously node modules if you don't knowabout them they're horrible uh so youneed to get ad commit some message hereget push origin problems will arise uhget ignore file just simply allows youto say here's a specific file or a classof files to ignore you can also go withthe inverse which is you can ignoreevery file and then just add the filesyou want to have it's kind of like a funway to dostuff um if you've never done that kindofstuff right and so you could have isthis the first or second this is thethis is the first part so we're going tocreate a node of modules or we're goingto create a get ignore file that hasnode modules in it right so if I go likethis Vim get ignore oopsies I alreadyhave Vim open here whoopsies we don'twant to do that uh I want get ignore andgo nodemodules modules by doing this if I golike this makeer uh Fu and then I goback to here let's see and I go back inhere and I go in here and go like thisuh bar. MD save that and then I go onemore and go node modules and I go inhere and add uh fu. MD right bam if I goget status you'll notice something Fuhasn't been added yet right so itdoesn't have any idea what's underneathso when I go get add everything and dothis you'll notice that it only addsFubar it does not add node modules andthat's very important and that's becausethis matched anything it's just amatch so you got to be careful carefulcareful careful include bid and buildyou coward no another cool thing about GI'm not sure if I talk about this hereI'm going to I'm going to go in here andI'm going to erase that right erase thatget add this get status you'll nownotice uh node modules is now addedright awesome so that means here's aninteresting thing I can do I can go inhere and go get ignore you can do uhlet's see let's go bar anything with theword bar in it getstatus now you'llnotice we have this and it didn't reallyquite do it I believe I had to go MDexact match can I exact match it get addthis get status I think because Ialready added it it causes a weirdnessget restore uh staged uh Fu bar. mty getstatus there we go it's gone right itdoesn't exist it's already been stagedso I had to unstage it there you go soif I erasee this and go back here getstatus you'll notice that it's now ableto be added back so you can actually doinner directory get ignoring which isprettynice I'm a big fan ofthat if you want to do it you don't haveto do it but it's cool it's cool to knowthat it's possible and one last thingthat you can do as well is there's afile calledum called uh what's it called get infoexclude you can see it right herethere's the path things that are ignoredin here are ignored for your localrepo they're notignored foreverybody and so this is a really coollittle file right here if you don't knowabout it I'm not sure if I talk about itbut you should like say you like for meone thing I always do is I go like thisI always I always have like an out filethat I always have so instead of addingit to my get ignore I can just add it tomy excludes and by adding it to myexcludes uh when I so you know when Irun some sort of program Echo Fu andpipe it to my out file when I go getstatus my out file just doesn't show upbut nobody else has to know about myouts ignore I like keeping all theignores in one place it doesn't makesense if you're working on a team rightwhen you're working on a team I have abunch of Stupid Files that I createregularly out out to and so I don't wantto have out files inside the G ignore soI put it inside the git uh git excludeslist which is kind of like that specialone there's also home get ignore Ididn't know about the home get ignore isthis like one uh is this a globalproject uh ignore see I mean G has a lotof features so I didn't know that thisis the same as a global level get ignoreof your work oh cool all right Perfectall right so here we go assignmentcreate two files in your repost securepassword. text and create a let's seefirst create this thing all right andcreate that all right we're going to dothat and then guilty pleasures all rightperfect get check out main I assumewe're supposed to be on the main branchare we on the main branchyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahyeah uh get status uh rmrf Fu let's getrid of all this get status all right getadd this get stat status uh there wego oopsies oopsies uh what is it calledwebflix there we go uh we're going tohere I'm going to get rid of that thingget ignore and go in here oh that's notwhat we wanted in there we wanted it insecure and then what did he saypasswords do text or some crap like thatand is that what he wanted password.text yeah and then one called guiltypleasures allright guilty pleasures.MD boom The Notebook let's go guiltyguilty AF finally create a get ignorewith both with Ensure both of thosefiles are ignored ignore the entiresecure directory and thenum all right perfectuh secure and then guiltypleasures all right and then let's seewith the message starting with M allright get commit we got to do a little Mmessage uh get ignore uh my uh mynotebook Pleasures okay you don't knowyou just don't even know how good thenotebook is allright there we go Nest to get ignores ohI actually already went through this weactually talked about this exact thingdidn't we oh my goodness we already didthis all right which is ignored allright hold on what are we doing herehere's the let's see here's the contentsall right we have these contents uhhere's the contents which is this Sourceassets get ignore which is going to beonly devs and main.py and this one'sgoing to be Vin bin activate so thatone's going to be this one uh right hereand this one's going to be only Dev andwhat's the other one main.py and main.pyokayhere's the here's thecontents wait hold on what's thequestion which is ignored they're allignored aren't they all ignored aren'tthey allignored does not necessarily have to beat the root it's fairly common to havethisone am I am I misreading things I meanthis one will be ignored yeah this oneshould be ignored and this one should beignoredokay oh oh yeah of course not I'm sostupid okay sorry I'm so stupid thisone's um main pie which does not existat this level okay I wrote this Iactually wrote this this one won't be exand then this the grot one has ven hasven V been activate which this oneshould be ignored as well right am Iwronghere shouldn't that one be ignored justequally whatever there we go onlydevs I want a main cupcake you can'thave one wrong what am I missingthere sell Boozled yeah it's not one ofthe options oh act let's see activate isa shell script not afolder ven is in Source oh V is inSource my bad okay I just wasn't lookinghard enough okay your G ignore file doesnot necessarily need to be at the rootof your project I haven't looked at thisin a little bit okay I wrote that to tryto be clear uh it's fairly common tohave multiple G ignore files yeah umthere you go we've already talked aboutthis one here's the Let's see we havealready done this one which is notignored okay soSource ven bin this one okay this makessense now we got it uh test. Pi whichone let'ssee test. Pi that one's not even inthere there we go we got it skill issuesI'm skill issuing come on shut up uh itwould be rough if get ignore onlyaccepted exact file path sectionsluckily uh they don't let's go over somewild card common patterns dude the starthat's the one that's the one thatalways works I do it constantly rootpatterns uh patterns starting with theslash are anchored to the directorycontaining the get ignore file forexample we ignored main Pi in the rootdirectory but not any subdirectorieswith that negotiation or negation youcan even negate patterns with prefixingwith an exclamation mark this is usefulif you want to ignore an entiredirectory except say an example file Ifind that to be really really useful isthat that kind of move right there I Ireally do like that you can do commentsthat's just like typical shell commentsbut how do you make a use of multiple Gignores save some notes or something uhif you want if you just want somethingignored a certain way you can do that Ifound it really useful when it came touh monor repos so if you've ever donemono repos in uh with like node orsomething you want to be able to have aget ignore for each one of those reposit seems to be really nice thatway so yeah data directories yeahexactly you just have like these littleget ignores so that way you don't haveone giant get ignore that's super hardto figure out what the hell is happeninginstead you can just do that so it'snice all right assignment use this getignore file to answer the question uhall right so that's a comment we'regoing to ignore everything with a with atext file except for the ones with nameand then we're going to do Source Mainand then content Source content isignored so this one is ignored Sourcecontent MD because this one is an exactfile name that matches this one and it'snot anchored so it should be is ignoredlet's go patterns it would yes wealready talked about patterns we alreadydid all this uh what's the otherquestion all right Main JS is main.jsignored no it's not cuz that's a commentit is not ignored let's go nice trytrying to bamboozle my own questions allright here we go they're trying tobamboozle me all right assignment Part Dwe'll do that soon all right here we goLet's ignore a generated file we ignoregenerated files because they can easilybe regenerated from stuff we do track inthis case we're going to use pandoc togenerate HTML from markdown files we'llignore the HTML files uh but commit amarkdown file first install pandoc Brewinstall I don't have that but we do havethisguy I can't show you guys thisscreen all right here we gouh there wego look at that look at how good that islook at how good that is fantastic therewe go we installed pandoc we can runpandoc version to see what that is so Ican go like thisum uh pan up uh hashr pandoc uh mypassword is big boobs everyone knowsthat big boobs 69420 all right here wego running pandoc all right create a newfile at the root directory called advertMD with the following content all rightso let's do advert that one whilesupplies last there we go uh Vim at ohuh let's go to this one Vim advert MDpaste all this stuff in there we go andthen run the markdown let's see run thefollowing command to generate the HMLdocument from that there we go pan docBop get status so now we have the wehave this one advertHTML beautiful uh for Fun open up themarkdown HTML and see what let's see wecan do that XD I don't want to do thatwe don't want to do that because I hadto go like I don't even think XT xtgopen does that workon look at that look at that Beauty lookat that be would you look at it wouldyou look at it there we go uh we'regoing to do we're going to do a getignore I think I have to do a get ignorehere oh it doesn't technically sayokay see finally add the file oh the getignore there we go uh Vim uh getignore what is it called it's advertHTMLbam get statusup get stat get status so I think Ishould be able to do that nope do I haveto add stuff finally add the getignore oh and commit the change servingwith 10 get add get status getadd get commit n was it n yeah Foo barscrewit got him there we go I finished it wefinished the entire course just likethat I'm level 12 you would evenunderstand what level 12 is you wouldn'teven understand it uh what's youropinion on how organization shouldhandle PR merges in main squash uh mergemerge commit or rebase which is mostuseful when you are responding to anincident which is the most useful forDev happiness overall in a proudenvironment well I mean here we go againI know here we go again damn uh I'llhere I'm GNA I'm going to say it thisway I personally like to rebase andsquash I like Fast Forward merges I liketo be prepared for the eventuality Ineed to uh revert a changes that's itnow some people it depends on your sizehonestly if you have just a couplepeople like why even have a policy I'mgoing to be real out there why even havea policy at all some people like torebate some people like to merge screwit let it all happen do you really wantto set up a whole bunch of red tape foryou and one other person like why whywhy add more to your life here I'mgoing to throw something outhere no matter what youchoose merge chaos fast forward mergesonly rebase squash no matter what youchoose there will be a group of peoplethat complain about it so we're going tostart this one so this one is a littlebit different okay this one is a bitdifferent this one is going to go over abunch of like conflicts and stuff okayhey I know you're about to take learnget to and I really wanted to show you acouple quick techniques to make it alittle bit easier because inevitably youmay mess up at least some of you areguaranteed to mess up you didn't readthe instructions well maybe it's notquite as clear as it needs to be and sothese are two little commands that aregoing to help you a wholebunch so the first thing I'm going to dois I'm just going to show the contentsof the previous commit that's going toshow Foo with a message of Fu 3 nowevery now and then you may have goofedup a little bit with your commit messageand you just want to change it you cango get commit amend this will give you achance to change your message but as awarning it does change your Shaw soobviously this is a destructive historyaltering item it allows you to changethe last commits commit message so if Igo like this get log one more timeyou'll see now it's Foo 4 and you cansee that and if I go get Foo let's seeif I do two of these you'll notice thatthere's not a foo three three in hereanymore looking at the change you'll seethat all it is is a new file called Fooprevious file was Devol meaning therewas no other file so it's just a newfile called Foo with a single linecalled Fu now if I actually want to undothis commit completely I can go getreset soft head TIY 1 this will undothat commit so now if I go get log justone line you'll notice it's not thatanymore but because it's soft and itleaves changes in your index and worktree if I go get status you'll see rightaway new file F okay we can work withthis get reset hard would not only undothat commit by one it would also removethe file so if you ever have to saychange something within a file or youneed to change the commit messageconsider get commit amend or considerget reset soft now I use actually getreset soft quite a bit when I'm doing arebase merge conflict this does happenevery now and then where I'm rebasingand I go okay I fix all my changes andthen I actually get commit those changesas opposed to calling get rebasecontinue if you make that mistake youcan actually use get reset soft headtill one to undo that commit and thenrebase continue it's kind of like a youknow it's like a it's a lot of IQ andit's really really nice so I just wantedto give you those two tips becausehonestly this course can be a bit meatyand without these two things kind offresh in your mind you mightaccidentally find that you get youryourself into a bad State and it's hardto undo it's actually pretty easy toundo these bad States thename is the gagen all right here we golet's do this let's get going okaywelcome to G part two I wrote this alsowhere you learn how to use G with a teamif you haven't taken the first G courseI'd recommend starting with it becauseit contains all these basic operationsokay uh the stuff in this course isgreat let's see the stuff in the firstcourse is great if you work by yourselfbut you'll need more if you want tostand a chance as a developer Mega Corpwhere we sell synergistic CRM customerrelationship Management Solutions toEnterprise that's right we do hey lookI'm wearing the same shirt I'm wearingthe same shirt what are the chances uhthis course assumes you've completed uhnumber one so you'll have all this crapthat we've already done we have alreadyblah blah blah blah so we've alreadydone that thing same shirt what are thechances there we go I'm just going torun this because we've already done thisokay we've run it we've doneit you need your own Fork of Mega corpsestarting repo a fork is a copy of thisone so we need to go here I'm going tofirst need to jump in here I'm probablygoing to need to uh can I fork or is itnot going to allow me I can't tell ifit's going to allow me or not nice let'sgo I've done it please select owner Forkalready exists shoot okay it's Ksensitive today I learned it's Ksensitive there we go I thought I justdeleted that but apparently I didn'tdeletethat there we go and create all right wegot the fork we're forked out of ourmind all right let's let's let's do thislet's do this all right so we got a forkwe did that we pressed the fork buttonwe did hey look at that hey look that'sme hey that's me doing that all rightboom boom boom boom boom boom boom runcheck pasting your link we're going topaste thatlink allright there we go all right what is afork uh we created a fork of theofficial a Corp repo inside your giupaccount it's a copy of the original thatyou can modify without affecting theoriginal you may have noticed that thereis no manual entry for get Fork git Forkis not a real thing right why forking isnot a git operation but is a featureoffered by many GI hosting servfacessuch as GitHub gitlab and bit bucketthose Services Fork a repo by creating anew copy of the repo and associating ituh as a fork of the original there'ssomething called like a fork Network orsomething like that with GitHub which isvery confusing it's like one Super Repoand there's some sort of thing that theydo underneath that's a little bit moreconfusing this is gamified git tutorialthis is a g tutorial I wrote and I'mgoing through when you Fork someoneelse's repo on GitHub you simply clonetheir repo into your local machine youcreate a new branch of The Originalswell technically I think it hassomething to do with this in the forkcreation network but I don't really knowhow it works create a copy of your ownlet's see of the repo and your ownGitHub account boom let's go that's whatwe did all right I'm not working TC nookay GI Fork is a command line operationthat takes no ffalse all right now let's clone it downlet's clone MegaCorp uh RM RF let's get rid of webflixlet's get of webflix local let's get ofuh Mega Corp MegaCorp uh getclone theprimagen get clone get clone primagenMega Corp Bim we're in we're in we're inin there we go perfect all right we'rewe're in okay so let's get let's let'sstart doing this whole thing becausethis is this is the one that in involvesa bunch more stuff uh when you Forksomeone's a repository like a platformlike GitHub you can copy a repositoryinto your account this is the standardway to contribute to someone else's opensource project uh steps are typicallyFork the repo to your account clone thefork to your local machine create abranch or feature make the changescommit the changes create a poll requestbada bing bada boom you're probablyasking yourself why should I Fork a repoinstead of cloning it cloning is a loteasier well that's a good question youfirst have to answer the question am Iinterested in contributing back to themain line or do I just want to perusethe repo if you wish to just simplyperuse the repo then a clone is justfine whereas if you wish to contributeto the open source project then it doesrequire a fork here's usually myworkflow when it comes to forking andmaking changes one I just Fork the repotwo I will clone down my forked repothree I'm going to make the changes tomy main branch four four I'm going topush my changes up to my Fork's mainbranch five I'm going to open up a PRwith my changes from my Fork onto theoriginal repo along with a nice detailedexplanation of what I have changed andwhy and finally I get rejected go homecry a little bit skill issues butnonetheless I tried and that's whatreally counts doesn't it it's also worthnoting that whenever I clone down myFork I also add a second remote that Icall Upstream that points to theoriginal repo and the reason is thatwhen the original repo changes I canbring in their changes and that way whenI fix something I know that I'm fixingon the latest version I'm Notaccidentally fixing something somebodyelse has already fixed this also avoidshaving conflicts during PRS and if youwish for your PR not to be rejectedhere's some pretty helpful hints numberone whenever I make a PR before I hitthat button and say make it live toeverybody I review my code on GitHubthis weird thing happens to me wheneverI review code on GitHub I seem to catchthings that I don't catch when I'm in myown environment I kind of think of thisas editor blindness you're so used toeverything that when you see it in aconcise different way you just seemistakes you've made so much easierprobably most importantly is make surethe maintainers want these changes spendthe time looking through the repo issuesmake sure you've searched and validatedthat this really is an issue and ifthere's no mention of it open up anissue tell the maintainers you'rewilling to fix it and see if they wantyou your fixes you may find thatmaintainers actually do not wish for youto participate or others they may wantyou to fix it but in a completelydifferent way as long as you're politein your communication and you're veryclear as to what you're trying to fixyou will find that often maintainers arevery happy to have you come on board andhelp out okay so assignment I want tomake sure people know how to do thisokay I want to make sure people knew howto do this like fun little bit add afile in your forked and cloned versionof Mega Corp to the repo uh to the repocontributors directory uh the fileshould be named let's see your get upusername text replace your username witha good one okay let's see add myself tothe contributor

like this get add uh uh getwhoopsies all right there we go so we'regoing to push this up right so I'm goingto do all this I'm going to push this uppush my changes to my GitHub uh to anadd contrib Branch oh gosh get checkoutadd contrib oh I'm not supposed to usecheckout sorry it's just I can't helpit I can't help that I dowho the hell doesthat who Noob Noob Noob he's a noob I'mnot even sure oh I I copied it from theboot. dev site remote addorigin all right there we go fixed fixedyou wouldn't understand understand fixedyou wouldn't understand you don'tunderstand because you're you're you'resoreloserboom I think it told me to create a pullrequest let me just make sure thatthat's what we're doing here all rightthere wego all right with the poll request opensubmit the test all right there we gorun all checks let's go owned ithead mean where me at now for those thatdon't know who grug is grug is the bestI always go down here and just I justread this line whenever I think of grgrug apex predator of grug is complexitycomplexity bad say again complexity verybad you say now complexity very very badgiven choice between complexity orone-on-one against T-Rex grug take T-Rexat least grug see T-Rex complexity badall right let's go like this okay forexample you should be on main branch ofyour local clone of your fork of MegaCorp repo which which means head ispointed to the main branch like allthings and gets eternals head is juststored in a file right here manually uhcheck to see what's in head yeah let'sdo that cat uh get check out main getcat uh dog I think it should be I thinkit should be the name of thething there you go yeah it's just a it'sjust a path path to the uh to the branchor the tag if I'm not mistaken G yeahyou got to G it baby you got to G it getthat son of a bee all let's see if thatjust works okay what did I I didn'tread all right what's the thing oh uhget Branch d add I must have misseddeleting that did it say to dothat okay my bad I didn't look I did notin fact look we're going G grug no readall right get reflog command pronounceda reflog not reflog is kind of like Getlog but stands for reference log andspecifically logs uh the changes to aref that have happened over time T thedefault one is the head by the way grugno read grug never read where head isnow one move ago two moves ago threemoves ago you are already familiar withhow git log Works how it shows yourcurrent branch and all the history ofthe commits so if I had a brand new repowith three commits a b and c and Iexecute log I should see the followingoutput and if I execute ref log I shouldsee this following output is reflog justa verbose log well no it's actually notit's very very different and toillustrate the point let's remove commitC I can remove commit C by using gitreset I can walk back one branch and asyou can see with Git log I now only haveb and a but if I use get ref log you'llnotice that I don't have two entries Iactually have four entries I have a b cthen back to B and notice that itcontains the command I use to get to Bwhich means that if you need to get thecontents of C you can actually use someof the plumbing of git plus reflog to beable to retrieve back out the contentsof C even though it's gone from yourbranch I cannot tell you how many timesreflog has saved my bacon by walkingback and getting some commits that havebeen long forgotten so what is reflogwell the definition from get SCM isreference logs or ref log records thetip of branches and other referenceswhenever they are updated or in layman'sterms reflog tracks the changes of abranch or other references otherreferences being head this means as youmove your head around from Branch tobranch or from commit to commit ittracks every last little step Ipersonally only ever use reflog to lookat how my head has transitioned overtime and Rescue out of commit if I needto all right assignments run get reflogto see what its output is all right herewe go get ref log look at that look whatitis going from ad contrib to main from uhfrom Main to ad contrib to this committo the Clone cool right you get to watchit kind of move aroundit's kind of cool I like it reflog isnice and it's really not all that badall right switch to a a new Branch offof it calledslander get uh switch C slander look atthat I remember to use that uh let's seecreate a new file called slander. MD andhave this one all right Vim slander. MDpaste that in uh Mega Corp CEO Laneenjoyed the live action last air bendermovie this Mega Corp CTO Prime is a fanof thenotebook okay Lane mayor or may not hada little bit of fun editing some ofthese things okay I don't know if Ididn't choose all of the stuff I'm justsaying you know the notebook's not a badmovieokaywhat Ifeel I even have to commitit okay it's not it's not bad okay it'snot bad Ulta movie was a good terriblemovie too did you cry I didn't cry I'mnot crying SL slanderous slanderousfilth I'm not even sure if I spelledslanderous right um boot. Dev run thatokay what am I not even doing here allright expected this contains all thisone oh I had to do b. slander goodnessgracious uh reset soft uh head I okay Igot to start reading you guys are nothelping meum uh be slanderyou guys got to quit but by the way didyou see that nice usage of get resetsoft huh ha did you like it I could haveget commit amend I could have we couldhave amend but this one is great okayit's okay it's okay to cry it's I don'tcry I work out I know we could haveamend okay but wedidn't okay delete Branch every ever uhshipped a bug to production main branchcreated a new Branch to fix it bug fixfixed the bug and committed the changesswitch backAC deleted deleted the fix bug Branchall right switch back to Main and deleteyour slander Branch get Branch Dwhoopsies get check out main get Branchoh I'm supposed to use switch but I Ijust I can't I cannot use switch okay Ican't use switch I can't I can't useswitch allright I want to use switch Boomer brainI know so you've deleted your branchthat had a unique commit On It All IsLost or is it remember get reflog keepstrack of where everything has been solet's do this get ref log look at thisbadboy that's where we did this one look atthis commit right here the commits rightthere the commit is right there okaythat means what we could do like here'sone one way to do it which I'm notsaying this is the way you should do itI'm just saying this is one way you cando it you like this you can go like thisyou can go uh get cat file- P rememberwhen we learned about all this and youcan actually go through all of thelittle internals and snatch out theslanderous file get cat file- P look atthis right there there's me enjoying thenotebook right we were able to Plumthrough things if you wanted to if youwanted to get deep in there and kind ofgo through the whole thing you could sothere we go we grabbed that and so wecan actually grab this and do that anddo a recovery message right so I coulddo this right there's other ways I couldalso do stuff right this is just one wayyou could also get merge and since Ialready have this thing I could actuallyjust merge over that change into itwe're not going to do it but you couldimagine we could do that so instead Icould just take the contents of this onefile and I can remake it if I wanted toas well even though it's not true committhat file with B recovery get add thiscommitdashb Recrecovery Boom Confetti out of mymind all right cherry pick would havebeen what I would want to do really Iwould have just merged it overright I mean it it just depends do youwant the history or do you not want thehistory like what happened if there's 10commits then you have to cherry pick allthe commits let's see using getinternals is exceptionally inconvenientwe had the copy and paste from cat filethree times I would not recommend doingit this way I just wanted to drive homethat at this point you can always dropdown to the plumbing commands if neededluckily there is a better way get mergeI just haven't talked about Cherrycommit that's why we haven't talkedabout that so I can do reflog this onefind the commit kit that one so I can doget cat file do all this crap which wedon't want to do I can also do thisright right I could have just mergedover exactly what it said from reflogright let's see do I still have thatreflog thing or did it open it in one ofthose windows uh I think it did that oneof those windows right yeah do I do nopager no page I can never remember whatthat lineis oh that's right you don't do it thereit's a get no pager there you goso as you can see you can see right hereso I could actually do get uh head atthe second position back right why doesget ref log allow us to potentiallyrecover commits on deleted branchesbecause it keeps a record of where thehead has been yes that's what itis there you go little fun little funreflogstuff merge allright let's see what can you merge withonly tags commits branches a commitcommit tag ref log entry anything thatcan resolve to a commit so that's whyyou'll see me use the term commit quitea bit in this[Music]course all right uh working with Git isa dream when all of the developers inthe project are committing changes todifferent lines of code things get alittle hairy when changes are uh to thesame lines are made at the same time onecommit isn't the parent of another let'sbreak some stuff remember Mega Corp isEnterprise CMR Service uh backed by thepower of git Essen it means that westore lists of customers data in a getrepo truly Cutting Edge stuff you shouldbe on the main branch uh create a newbranch called add customers all rightget branch no wait it's get is it getswitch see there wego all right there we go we got that oneand we're going to grab this one uh tocustomers a CSV allright all is it all like that one yeahthere we go so we're going to add it toall customers and then we're going toalso do orgs partner. text right thereBoot and startup so we're going to doorgs partners. text there we gobeautiful we've done those two makecommit your changes with the thing Cokay we're we're going to kind of cruisethrough these easy Parts because Iassume at this point you guys understandadding committing doing all that umbecause this is all easy stuff rightnone of this stuff is crazy allright get status get add this get commitI think I said c right yep see uh uhsuch Carson much HDMX all rightthere we go and now we're going toswitch back to Main and we're going todo this to customers uh get check outmain uh go back to here edit this thingjump up here customers all add Jsongross HTM Z contributor get add thisget get commit what do we need to dowith d That's right d uh Jon is betterthan uh Carson more like cars off allright so do you do you see what we'vejust done heredo you see how this is going to causeproblems so if I go like this uh get loguh on line um on line- P1 main you'llnotice that I edit customers with oneline right below company title if I dothe exact same thing but I do it uh withthe add customers Branch you'll noticethat I do the exact same thing to thesame customer files in the same locationin other words we both modified the sameline and by modifying the sameline G doesn't know what to do becausegit doesn't understand anything aboutcode it only understands things aboutmodified lines if two lines have beenaltered in some way it creates a mergeconflict there wego I believe that should just work therewe go and let's go conflicts yeah yeahyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so mergeconflict occurs when two commits modifythe same line and get automaticallydecide which changes to keep and whichchange to discard consider the followingcommit history ABC this is pretty muchwhat we have now except for it's a c andd uh the main branch has something likethis uh is nice returns this one featurehas this one is nice 420 right if we tryto merge feature into main G will detectthat the return line was changed in bothbranches independently which creates aconflict so this is good this is good tounderstand right when a conflict happensusually as a result of merge or rebasegit will prompt PRP you to manuallydecide which changes to keep it's okaywhen the same line is modified in onecommit and then again in a in a latercommit the problem arises when the sameline is modified in two commits thataren't in the uh in a parent childrelationship all right if the linechanged in B was all the conflict changein B's parent a the htx guy writes anessay about it that's true Carson willprobably write an essay about it uhthat's perfectly fine get knows ahappened first then be yep that's thething you can't conflict yourself likethat right you just can't all right iftwo developers on separate branchesmodify the same line of code whathappens when the branches are mergedHTMI htx guy relaunches the project witha new name facts it's perfectly finefalse conflict arises there we goassignment it was stupid Greg stupidGreg who merged his new customer datainto main commit D while you wereworking on your new customer data in adcustomers Branch commit C because hischange made it into main first stupidGreg it's up to you to resolve theconflict stupid Greg now because yourmanager is a lite that learned a codebefore Version Control was invented heasked you to merge instead of rebaseabsolutely this is all true switch toyour add customers branch and merge maininto it all right there we go we shouldget this one let's go let's go get checkout add customershey uh get Branch dadd uh add contribwait why is contri still there I thoughtI just deleted itwhy is there why is there multiple adcustomers whatever that's confusingwhatever I don't got time for this damnit Greg leptos mentioned leptospotentially mentioned get mergemain all right boom we got ourselves aconflict okay uh if we run get statusyou can confirm that we're in a conflictso if I go get status you can see righthere you have unmerged paths fix theconflicts and run get commit and use aget merge abort to abort the merge so wecan actually stop the merge by doingthat get out of here okay there we goget run status like this to confirm thatyou're in a conflict we can see that solet's run thisthingboom Oh waitwhat oh my gosh this thing isincorrectlane laneLane we have a problem this is this iswrong our Direction somehow got out ofconf out of out of stuff here I knowwhich means I go like this get uh mergeabort get check out main get merge uhget merge uh addcustomers there wego kind of BSLane all right right here I'm going togo back here I'm going to report this uhwait does it am I wrong here did I justmaybe I justdidn't hold on get uh merge getmerge aboard get check out maybe I didthiswrong yeah I used the wrong one laneit's not right lane you're right you'reright this whole time I'm the bad oneI'm the bad one I'm the bad one shut upget check out you dumb folk I know Imessed up isolate to changes and mergecorrect you merge yourself correctresoling conflicts is a manual processwhen they happen get marks theconflicted files and ask you to resolvethe conflict by editing the files inyour editor so here we go open up thecustomer all and you should see this allright so here wego here's our customer so you can seetwo you can see a couple things herejust so everybody knows in emergeconflict this represents uh hours is thetop one hours is where our head athere's the change in hours the changeends with the equal sign and then thisis the one and then the bottom onerepresents the incoming Branch theirs sotheirs is main ours is head and this isthe change in theirs this is the changein ours okay it's pretty good to knowthosethings right uh let's see delete theconflict Mar markers and leave bothchanges and Greg's changing the file itshould look like that so we can actuallyyou can actually have both changes atthe same time right nothing says youhave to change it it's up to you toresolve how to to do this you can acceptboth totally reasonable uh sa file anddo thisokay yeah we can we can accept boththere's nothing that says you can'tacceptbothright allright resolution after manually addingany conflicted conflicting filesometimes it's more than one file ormore than one section of a file yousimply need to add and commit thechanges this tells get that uh you'veresolved the conflict and can continuewith the merge okay awesome we can dothat so let's let's resolve with thisnice message right here it's a nicebeautiful message get add this getcommit uh- M all of that oh my goodnessstupidGreg ohno all right there we go apparently Idon't know how to do that there we gogot it first try and now we can do logto examine the homework you should see cand d and commits come together and Ecommit all right get uh log on line lookat that beauty and then we can go online graph there you go it all comestogether in E we resolved the conflictbada bing bada boom very nice absolutelyliked it absolutely enjoyed that allright all right you just ran get mergedand you're now seeing this okay I justrealized what was happening I was likewait a second uh which code in theconflict is yours and which is theirs soif we ran get merge that means this isours this is their theirs the top is thetop is mine the bottom is theirs it'sall mine stay away I prefer that answerhonestly um all right you just ran getmerge and you're now facing thisconflict oh let's see what does headrefer to it's another name for themaster branch no it's another name forthe main branch no it points to thelatest commit in the other Branch you'recomparing to no it points to the currentBranch's latest commitboom it's pointing to where head pointsto everybody knows that is that easyback to me your manager at Mega Corp isnot happy it turns out you were neversupposed to add customers to the all.CSV file at all only Greg is allowed todo that stupid Greg this is what you getfrom making changes without 10 designmeetings and an alignment ofstakeholders what were you expecting tobe productive this is Mega Corp processover productivity get back inline I don't want to hurt anybody'sfeelings but at the same time I know alot of people just got bruised by thatone statement I'm sorry I'm sorry thatright there's some of you that hurt thatparagraph hits home I know it does let'sjust say I've written a design documentfor the the dumbest thing stakeholdersare okay in the 10th design meeting buthave problems when the implementationhits BR always every single timeassignment let's fix our hastiness by uhdoing a git hard of the merge committhis will allow us to take a differentapproach to resolve the conflict luckilywe haven't borked main yet we just uhneed to fix our ad customer Branch whileon ad customer Branch reset to commit Callright let's do that oh my goodness umlet's go like this let's go what is itcalled Mega Corp yeah yeahyeah get reset uhhard uh head till the one there we gowe're back to C everything is greatwe're looking good we're feeling goodthere we go we do all that nice stuff soI just I I literally just took thechange moved back my Branch ones anddiscarded my index my work tree changesbada bing bada boom easy peasy pumpkinseedy that's just that all right uhlet's fix our hastiness by doing a hardreset yeah we already did that luckilywe haven't borked main yet so we'll justuh fix all right here we go try mergingmain into customers again this timeresolve the conflict by keeping only thechanges for main I want to see somethingcuz I may accidentally have uh R re onand if I do then it's going to say it'sallfixed nice I don't have R re on uh getconfiglist uh Global grap re re oh Ido wait shouldn't re read take care ofthat doesn'twouldn't Riri re jump into that am Iconfused here am I be whatwhat I thought it did well then whydidn't it it should have Auto conflictit record yeah record resolution wassolved was added weird Why didn't itjust Why didn't it auto resolve righthere shouldn't have just Autoresolved oh wait oh oh my goodness I amso stupid I am so stupid it did itautomatically using previous resolutionso if I go to customers oh my goodnessI'm so dumb look at this the conflict isgone the reason why the conflict is goneis I knew I had re re-enabled so sincethe customer doesn't have a conflict init we need to disable R re get uh configI'm just going to do a local one uh I'mjust going to go like this add local rere re enabled false right so I'll justadd a local one so I still have myGlobal one so it still continues to dowhat it'sdoing uh get merge abort then get mergeum get merge main which should now thereyou go I now have the conflict withoutre taking over and I should be able tojust go intohere uh and I should be able to go toall and now we have this again so nowthis time we're supposed to selectGreg's change which is theirs so I cango like that boom Greg's change selecteduh there's some other ways you can dothat to make it easier but this is goodso we're going to go like this find Greghave this one boomuh we're going to go here and go get Ststatus get add this get commit dasm withthat one there we go um and then jump inhere dothat there we go there we go all right Ithink that'sgood all right ours versus theirs uh ina merge conflict ours refers to thebranch you are on merging into theirsrefers to the branch being mergedthis is important get merged theirBranch ours is the branch you're onright uh getterminology last time we manually editthe conf uh conflicting files this timelet's use get built-in merge resolutiontools to make the uh let's see use theterms hours and theirs to refer to thebranches being merged you shouldcurrently be on ad customers with thiskind of History right now switch back toMain and merge ad customers into mainthis would result in a fast forwardmerge bringing C to e into main deletead customers all right get check outmain get merge add customers get Branchdelete uh add customers boom look howfast Iam all right so let's do a better let'sdo an ours versus theirs merge becausethis is really good to know uh all rightso we got a multi conflict so far we'veonly dealt with one Conflict at a timethat's a small that's small potatoeslet's see what happens when we havemultiple conflicts to resolve all rightso let's switch to a new Branch off Maincalled delete records uh get switch Cthat uh and then let's see editcustomers all and delete the jesson lineokay there we go deleted it edit orgpartners and delete the boot dodevrecord okay org Partners there we goboot dodev recordboom Oh we want to keep theline there we go uh let's see six let'ssee switch back to main uh and editcustomers oh commit the message with fwe got to commit the message with f getstatus so I'm going to I'm going to useuh I'm going to use what's it calledfugitive for this part cuz it's justeasier and faster and you guys don'treally care about committingright what do we need todo F uh F uh uh delete those recordsright I just prefer that uh get checkoutmain just makes life easier being ableto use that because we can move fasterthere we go uh all right so we have thisone so edit the ORS partner and add aboot dodev record uh to Sales Inc ohchange it and change the boot to SalesIncorporated yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahyeah yeah yeah so I can go like thisSalesIncum there we go we did that one so now weshould have this one and do a g there wego and uhccg uh suchInc there we go we now have that one runand submit the test there we go wait isthat all we had to do did I misssomething I thought I thought we weredoing multipleoh we forgot to do that we forgot to dothat one we forgot to do that one Carsonuh gross that's right allright uh customers all andgo Carson gross go here s there we go soI just all I did was I just did rightthere for those that don't know I justdid a uh I did a get uh commit amend noedit and so by doing a get commit amendno edit I simply just um I know I wroteshut up shut up it just means I mergedin that change right so I merged in thatchange right there and I did that oneyou know cuz I'm not going to lie to youit is very nice to be able to use thetools I'm used to you know what I mean Idon't always do everything by thecommand line there we go all right so wedid all that one we have these nicecommits now we have these two things andso now all we have to do is just causethe conflict let's gowait what did Idooh oh mygoodness here I forgot to do that thereyou go I'll show you what I did getstatus so I have this one get add thisone get commit uh amend no edit there wego so I kept the same the same uh linejust not everything elsewait what am I doing wrong here Carsongrow hmx Creatorwhat I'm not good atreading I'm not good at reading okayI've never said that I was good atreading allright first try let's go first try checkout the conflict we've manually editedfiles to resolve the conflict but itturns out git has some built-in tools tohelp us the git checkout command uhlet's see can check out the individualchanges during a merge conflict withtheirs an ours flag while on Main mergedelete records all right get mergedelete records so now we should have twoconflicts you can see the two conflictsright here get status you can see thetwo conflicts right here unmerged pathboth of those get diff should show eachone of them having the problem righthere which means that I can go like thisuh how do we do this we're going to keeptheirs for customers all and keep oursfor partners so I can like this getcheck out theirs uh that's going to beuh customers uh all there we go so now Ihave uh theirs and then ours is going tobeorgs uh Partners there we go so now if Igo like this get uh diff you'll noticethat we have no changes everything looksgood get status perfect get add this ifwe look at them in here you'll noticeright away there we go so that's thedeleted one that we kept and then fromorgs and partners you'll notice that wehave Sales Inc from our side so SalesInc from our side deletion from theirside by using uh get checkout there's anours hours it's pretty nicewhat do we need to do here we need to dothis with an ah uh M uh H uh let's seesuch uh resolution conflict you'll alsonotice something else notice that orgsis not a part of any changes here do yousee that there's no orgs a part ofchanges that's because that wasn'tchanged by accepting my change thiscommit doesn't contain any change doesthat make sense because that file onlyhad one change to it which was my changeso by me uh accepting it the differencebetween these two goes to zero it's goodto know so that's why sometimes thosethings can change and it can look alittle bit confusing it's actually notall that confusing it just means thatsomething goofedup oh mygoodness how am I so bad atthis oh yeah let's go all rightsomething you may have noticed whenresolving merge conflicts is that youdon't get the standard merge uh mergecommit message right no you don't youhave to manually provide a messagetyping uh it actually makes sense whenyou think about it g doesn't know whatyou did to resolve the conflict and it'sencouraging you to document your changevia the uh message that makes senseright I think everybody understands thatuh what commit message is used afterresolving that the standard one unhingedcommit message for example we shouldhave rebase instead I actually like thisone that's my favorite one but we'll doa custom commit[Music]message now we're going to do rebase onethis one's going to be a good one allright rebase uh full disclosure a lot ofrebases bad rep comes from conflictsfear not it's nothing you can't handlewith just a SCH smidge of practicerebasing feels scarier because itrewrites get history which means you arenot if you're not careful you can losework in an unrecoverable way but as longas you understand what's going on itwill make your and your teams gethistory cleaner and easier to understandand more so easier to revert when neededit is impossible to revert your changewith several merge uh merge commits andall that I've seen some pretty nastyones where you're trying to do thatassignment create a new branch calledband a copy of main branch and add a newfile customers band all right there wego scabi toilet merch when get checkoutdasb band I didn't use switch didn't useswitch it happened it happened but we'regoing to get keep on going for it band.MD is that what it was no uh band. CSVboom put it in yeah Sam Sam controlmanclosed AI classic really true ABabsolutely actually true there we go sowe have this one we're going to do getmessage I so I'm going to go in here c ci uh control man there we go and so nowlet's go like this get check out main doone of those and then how do we want todo here we want to have the same Samcontrolman but a different but adifferent one of these there we go umand then jump up here and go ch oh no wait Jyou'reright H comes before H beforeI except afterC's right is that how it goes I'm onchapter 7even section four right now allright well let's go let's go all rightso there we go so we have all this oneso we should be able to run this to makesure it's all actually the way we wantit to be so I'll go like this we'll runthis bad boy it's going to do all thisbada bing bada boom bada bing bada boomall right beautiful we are just crushingthrough this course okay people werefeeling good make the conflict before wemove on I just want to remind you thatit is often uh not often that you'll becreating your own conflicts we're doingso because you probably don't have anyfriends to practice with I don'tactually Kid Art users uh but even ifyou do have many developer friends let'sjust make all the changes ourselves soyou don't need to bother them let's seeyou switch to a new Branch fix bug whichis just a copy of main while you'refixing the bug someone else merch isthere changes the domain you fix the bugand it happens to edit the same file uhyou open up a poll request rebase fixingdomains get tells you the conflict youresolve the conflict you uh complete thePO request this is like standardoperations right we all know this one sowe switch the band Branch rebase uh itinto main uh which rewrites to gethistory of band Branch because rememberit needs to add that extra commit sothere we go we're going to do that allright so we're going to go like this getcheck out band right there get re rebasemain my gosh we have a conflict look atthat conflict oh no oh no so if I go inhere I look at my status you can seeright here we have problems don't we weactually have problems all right well uhyou should get a conflict you might alsonotice something odd this time headpointed to Mains change rather thanbands change all right so let's justjump back for a quick second and justvalidate this and I'll explain why allright so notice that this should be bandprotagonist should bemain look ate has protagonist which isMain's change why is oursMains even though we did a rebase onband why why isn't hours hour change whyis it Maine's change does anybody knowthe commit comes fromMaine no cuz that would make it' make ittheirs we move to main then replay ourcommits on it boom let's go so this isfrom section one this is why section oneis so important is when you rebase yourtarget Branch becomes your branch thatyou're on and then you replay the sourcebranches commits starting from the mergebase and forward at the tip of yourtarget Branch therefore let's write thisout because it might be a little biteasier to visualize so this is the mostimportant part remember so when I'm onband and I do git rebase main whathappens is I actually check out mainwhich is going to be at the tip I grabthe differences between uh uh what's itcalled band and Main and then I do bandyou know if there was multiple commitsI'd actually attach each one of them tothe front so that'd be like band one uhband two uh band three right so I'd getthem all on there so my Branch now lookslike this where the tip of main is nowthe new merge base as opposed towherever I branched off before whichcould be somewhere in the history sothat is why ours is theirs and theirs isours during a Reb rebase conflict it'sactually not confusing if you know howrebase works it makes perfect sense it'sthat you have to switch branches andthen play the commits all right let'ssee what happens here let's let's seewhat our assignment is switch the newbranch do this uh copy of branch and addthe new file customers this this thisthis this we've already done this allright there we go assignment switch toband rebase on domain while uh youshould get a conflict you might alsoknow something outd we already talkedabout why if you had merged main insteadof rebase head would still point to bandcorrect because merge does not swapreplay it just adds or creates a mergeconflict into a single point there we gothat's good to know however you kind ofneed to think in Reverse with rebasetheirs represents the band Branch uhwhich in reality is our change so we'regoing to Branch you'll notice thatyou're not on a branch that's right thatmakes perfect sense right becauseremember it has to create this no Branchsituation where it takes Main and thenstarts applying commits to it so you'rein a no Branch situationright there wego bam look at that look at thatconfetti man first try first try uh thesame get check out theirs and get checkours uh commands we used in merge can beused to resolve conflicts during arebase you may have also noticed that ifyou open the file in your editordepending on your editor uh it has UIfeatures to help you resolve theconflict yep so this would be uh VSScodes accepting incoming changes is thesame as checkout theirs acceptingcurrent changes is the uh is the same asget checkout ours that would be intheirs I don't know how I don't know howto use I don't know how to use vs codeall right assignment uh use theappropriate get checkout command tooverwrite the band Branch's changes withthe changes from Main so since it's mainthat we want get uh status get checkoutout hours our Branch remember we're dingmain allright there we go uh let's see then hithim with the rebase continue get rebasecontinue There we go and then we getlogged to see the new commit history getlog look look at how good that lookslook at that look at how good that looksallright you may have noticed something didanyone notice that I was gone why was Igoneso theirs is main no ours is main duringthat situation the the number of rulesindicates that this isn't intuitive noit just means that it can be potentiallycomplicated anything that issufficiently complicated requires you tolearn if you only worked on things thatare intuitive you would never userecursion like that's that it hasnothing to do with it being the thenumber of rules have no indicationwhether it's intuitive or notunderstanding the underlying reasoningwhy or what happens makes it intuitiveto understand I understand how you orrebase Works therefore ours versustheirs is intuitive to understand butthat's because I have a understanding ofwhat's Happening expected a state tocontain this way H uh Branch oh I'm notoh I haven't uh oh uh get rebasecontinue oopsies did I not get statusdid Inot there we go we've continued it getsstatusawesome all right let's dothis perfect we're in we did why did thedeleted command what happened why was Igone so for those that don't understandso why where's I why is I not inhere the reason why I is not in hereremember this is that I was a changewhere deleted deleted a specificrecord and what we dowe ignored that one change by ignoringthe one change that I was we've droppedthe entirety of therecord since the there is no likethere's no empty commit when the commitis empty the commit isdropped right yes we are working on theband Branch we started a rebase of bandonto Main meaning we're rewriting thehistory of band to include all thechanges of main we effectively removedall the changes of the I commit bychoosing to keep the changes from Maininstead of band we continued to rebaseand get realized that the I commit waspointless because we're rewritinghistory anyways just remove it there'sliterally nothing in it right there's noI in team that's why if our if ourchanges had been more complicated say wekept some of the changes from I commitand overrided others then git would havekept I in the commit history why did gitremove our commit because this is MegaCorp and we have a strict no commitpolicy uh because rebase is scary and itshould be avoided at all cost because itwas a essentially empty and rebase isokay with rewriting history bada bingbada boom there's nothing to committhere's nothing there it's just makinglife easy right uh what if the only partof the commit had been undone during therebase comp what if only part of thecommit had been undone then the commitwould have still been let's see wouldhave still been removed no the commitwould have remained in thehistory let's let's go on to this oneokay let's clean up our branchesremember during these uh during therebase of band onto Main we actuallydiscarded the changes of band whichactually means that band is now justidentical to main anyways so yeah sowe're going to switch back to Main anddelete uh band right uh get check outmain get Branch D band there we go allright so let's delete some brancheswe're going to delete uh get a branchokay we did that one and now let's goover here let's go there we go all rightlet's moveon all right disable re well uh we itshould have already been disabled thisthis section does need to technically goback cuz already did a local one ofthose uh I here I think I don't think Ideleted this I'm not sure if I even haveit but here I'm going to get rid of itjust in case right repeat resolutionsetup a common complaint about rebase isthat there are times when you have tomanually resolve the same conflict overand over again this is especiallyprevalent when you have long runningfeature branches and even more likelymultiple feature branches that are beingrebased onto Main re re re to the rescuethe get re re re functionality is a bitof a hidden feature by the way this isdirectly from G sem can you believe thatone of the most useful features of alltime is just hangingout uh here hold on uh get R re re therewe go let's go get SC look at thisfunctionality is a bit of a hiddenfeature wait you're telling me I didn'thave to resolve it everytime yikes the name sound let's seestands for reuse recorded resolution asthe name implies as the name implies itallows you to ask G to remember how youresolved a hunk conflict so that thenext time it sees the same conflict Gcan resolve it automatically in otherwords if re let's see if enabled a rewill remember how you resolved aconflict applies to rebasing but alsomerging and will automatically applythat resolution the next time you seethe same conflict pretty neat right am Iright all right assignment create a newBranch off of Main called faves allright good check out B faves didn't useswitch suck it new commands create afile called uh faves. MD with thefollowing contents let's go uh jump backin here go here go herewait customers okay customers uh favesfaves.MD there we go cool uh commit that withmessage K create a copy of faves branchcalled fave 2 all right here we go uhwe'll go in here we're going to go herewe're going to CC we're going to K uh mafaves is the uh heisen right boom boomget check out dasb faves 2 so now wehave the same Branch twice okay okay thesame Branch twice all right now we'regoing to switch back to uh Main andcreate a file called faves with adifferent content all right here we goget check out dashb main get U Mannymain oh crap I created Manny get checkout main get Branch D Manny got himfirst try uh and then go in here and putand put that in there and get status getadd this get commit dasi what is itcalled should be with an L take the Ltake the L bam all right so now we havethese right here we have main on L faveson K faves 2 on K the the changes from Land K naturally conflict run the testlet's go we're going to run the testwe're running the test let's go we'rerunning it confetti out of my mind areyou ready for the confetti out of mymind enable the re re feature by runningthe following command all right so I'mjust going to like this get uh getconfig unset local re re re enabled cuzI have a get conf config uh list grip rere re there you go I already have itglobally true for everything because Ilike the setting switch to faves andrebase it on to main all right get checkout uh faves get brand or get rebasemain there we go so notice this we'regoing to do this conflict we're going tobe doing this recorded pre-image forcustomer there we go we're getting readywe're re re reing okay so we have aconflict let's do this let's solve thisconflict notice out let's see hold onaccept both changes all right let'saccept some changes okay e yes yes yeschanged get add this get rebasecontinue all right so now what are wegoing to do with the naming um stage andrebase leave the commit message as K allright boom got it note that git Mayautomatically open a file on your editorin which you can edit the commit messageSimply Save and close and continue whenyou're done you should see somethinglike this so you should notice that weshould see something like this recordedresolution recorded resolution yeahwe're read out of our mind we're readout of our mind now switch to faves 2and rebase may it on to main all rightget check out faves to get rebase mainnow look at this we have a conflict butit's alreadyresolved right it's already resolvedbecause we already we already resolvedthis specific commit so now we don'thave to resolve it again it alreadyknows what to do it already knows whattodo so now I can just I can do the exactsame thing I can do the whole get uhrebase continue so R is really reallynice because it's one of those thingsthat if you do it right it is uhfantastic uh why is re disabled bydefault because it can lead to confusionso if you don't know what it is it'sprobably dangerous to have it createdwhat's foot comes with Riri let's sayyou have a change that results in aconflict but you want to resolve itdifferently but instead it automaticallyresolves it for you you could feelpretty confused right so that's why it'snice to have it as a feature you optinto because that way you don'taccidentally screw it up all right let'sgo on merge back in PH now we have twobranches faves and faves 2os that areahead of Main in the same way we don'tactually need both faves and faves 2osso switch back tomain try deleting fave 2 with lowercaseD flag now actually delete it withcapital D we've already we've I thinkI'm not sure if we've actually done thatget check out main if you don't know ifyou go if you try to delete a branchthat ends there it terminates uh yourcommit history it'll be like yo um Youprobably don't want to do that and soyou have to give them the old you haveto give them the old capital D and whenyou give him the D it then does it thenmerge faves into main this should resultin a fast forward merge deletes thefaves Branch there we go get merge favesget Branch d uh faves boom let's go grabit paste it all right accidental commituh you know uh how let's see how withmerge uh conflicts you can commit theresolution but with rebase you have todo continue dude I've done this so muchin my life I cannot tell you how manytimes I've done this dude I know I'mtelling you which is me tellingme I cannot help this one how do youundo that dude get res dude this is thegreatest thing in the universe rightthere this solves that problem if youever accident you've never done itreally oh my gosh when I re when I whenI get when I get rebase when I when Iresolve a conflict I do get ad dot itimmediately I go get ad rebase or get orget commit Dash app and I commit it andI'm like and I just hate it but ifyou just do a reset soft remember a softtakes the commits changes applies themto your work tree and moves your branchback once so you get all of your you getyour rebase right there now I believethis has been largely fixed I believenow you can actually do a rebase uhcontinue even after you've committed itand it just works you just get that youget that new message instead before itused to not work I love this one whydoes get reset help you if you acentcommit during a rebase because you canundo the commit and continue the rebaseyes exactly that's why I loveit okay we're going to go over a quickbit of squashing okay every Dev teamwill have different standards andopinions on on how to use git some teamsrequire all poll request to contain asingle commit While others prefer to seea series of small focused commits if youjoin a team that prefer single commityou'll need to know how to squash yourcommits together to be fair even if youdon't need a single commit squashing isuseful to keep your G history clean yesand it makes it easy to revert again ifyou have a feature that could bedangerous in production and it's spreadout over 12 commits that have like 18merge commits it is really reallyannoying versus just having one commitat the end score squash it easy to putin easy to pull out okay what issquashing exactly well sound let's seeit's what it sounds like we take all thechanges from a series of commits andsquash them into a single commit okayall of them A B C D to axeasy assignment let's get ready tosquash some commits push your currentchanges up to your forked repo on GitHubjust in case your machine goes swimmingdon't skip this okay here we go get pushorigin origin main go all right uhcreate a new Branch off Main called tempmain get check outtemp m-b let's go all right so now thatwe have that we do all this let'sgo let's go we're back in um to becompletely fair I I mean I am justabsolutely I I have whatsomeone oh get checkout DB temp mainyeah there we go all right how to squashperhaps confusingly squashing is donewith get rebase command it may not beintuitive but remember re base allowsyou to apply or reapplyhistory this will make sense more here'sthe uh steps to squash the last endcommits start an interactive rebase withget rebase head uh or slash or Dash ey Ithink they call it tack ey in themilitary get rebased hack I head tillthe end where n is the number of commitsyou want to squash get will open yourdefault editor with a list of commitschange the word pick to squash or S saveand close the editor the I flag standsfor interactive and allows you to editthe commit history before get appliesthe changeshead till the end is how we referencethe last end commits head points to thecurrent commit there you go does thatmake sense uh why does rebase squashremember rebase is all about replayingchanges when we uh rebase onto aspecific commit end till the or headtill the end we're telling get to replayall the changes from the current branchon top of that commit then we are usingthe interactive flag to squash thosechanges so that rebase will apply themall in a single commit assignment MegaCorp Executives do not like your lastfew commits as a result your managertold you to squash the last threecommits J L and K into a new singlecommit message J redacted squashing isdestructive operation which is whyyou've decided to make the change toTemp main before moving it to main whileon temp main squash these three don'tforget to pick or squash it and edit Jredacted let'sgo uh so I'm going to go like this getrebase or first get log so we want to goall the way to J so 1 2 3 uh get rebaseI head 3 Let's Go so I always go likethis there we go you'll notice righthere it says it right here that you cando that s stands for squash use thecommit and meld it into the previous sothat means s uh go let's see how doesthis go itgoes this let's see this one goes intothe previous and then this one I forgethow exactly how these things end up buteither way it ends up it ends up good Iforget the exact merging order uhredactedright there wego there we go so if I go get log uh oneline you can see that J is redacted andthe rest are all right there perfectright but they still can change thechange set so if I go- P it still hasthe whole change set it just doesn'thave uh what's it called it just doesn'thave the individual commits all rightoverride now that temp main is in thestate you want and hopefully youverified that with Git log we need to douh what the boss asked delete the mainbranch rename the 10 Branch into mainensure that t main branch is goneresubmit now obviously this is a verydangerous operations we rewriting publichistory we're doing it just for funbecause hey why not uh but we're doingit okay so don't don't do that by theway Branch delete main get check out umget oh don't actuallydo uh temp main main this is this isdangerous okaythere wego we did some naughty stuff we squashedmain which means that because our remotemain branch on GitHub uh has commitsthat we removed git won't allow us topush our changes because they're totallyout of sync git push has a commandcalled Force flag which allows us tooverride a remote Branch with our localbranch it's very dangerous but usefulflag that overrides the safeguards andjust says make this Branch as same asthe branch so by doing this we'reactuallychanging that stuff and that could beobviously you would never want to dothis to a main okay just so you know goahead and force push your local main tothe branch on remote main uh I know bythe way you should never actually dothis okay this this is this is crazyokay squashing is scary when you squashcommits for example ABCD and you into asingle commit you're removing historyfrom a project so all the changes arestill there but the individual markersof each changes are gone it's one bigcommit now in the last few lessons weerased all the commits meaning we can'tgo back to the individual checkpointsanymore or you can't go backeasily we can still use git plumbing andreflog to actually rehydrate everythingand reput it back into it we can butwe're just currently not doing that whenyou squash commits you lose history ofthe individual commits that's whathappens you can still get it back it'sjust that it's just non-trivial rightwhen you squash commits the contentstays the same correct the content staysthe change it's just that you change thecommits yeah never squash Master neversquash master I put that in there so Icould talk about it and why it's crazywe did some weird thing squash commitsto m now let's do a common thing squashall commits on a feature Branch for apoll request if your team prefers singlecommit poll request we will likely beyour workflow create a new Branch offMain go about your work when you'reready to get your code into main squashall your commits into a single one pushyour branch to the remote One open up apoll request merge it uh once it'sapproved all right assignment firstlet's just do points one and two MegaCorp needs to add a new feature to thecontent management system specificallythey need a script that willautomatically scan for sensitiveinformation in the repo create a newBranch add scanner off of Main all rightthis is where things are going to get alittle bit wild here get Branch or uhcheck out dasb I know it's switch Ican't I don't want to do it I don't wantto do it I'm too much of a lite um allright in the scripts directory there's afile called scan sh replace uh the to-docomment with this all right I can't helpitokay all right in the scripts uh thingscan f8 write the script there we go wegot it um all right there we go we havethat one run the code from the root repoall rightlook at that we have oh my gosh we haveso many social SEC or credit cards somany co credit cards just flyingeverywhere finally now we can do socialsecurity numbers add another few linesto the script all right there we go uhrun the script again to ensure it worksoh did I not oh I forgot to commit oh Iforgot to commit I forgot to commit holdon k um uh creditsthere wego wait why isn't thatworking oh did I did I actually deleteohcrap all right there we go now we canpaste this in there we go all rightthere we go so now I can go CC and thisone should be J right this should be Lyep okay so this one will be L um thisone will be uh Social Securitynumbers my bad my bad I accidentally didthat one out of order now we should dophone numbers there we go add add onefor phone numbers added it for phonenumbers there we go there's some phonenumbers in there CC uh and this is HJ KLM uh phone numbers there wego looking good run the script one lasttime make sure it works there we go allright I actually uh I accidentally uh Iaccidental your commit I knowhappens there we go all right so we gotourselves set up for this nice next onesquash series remember the full workflowwe're going to be doing which we alreadytalked about this creating your branchmaking yourcommits squashing it making the pullrequest let's tackle point three squashuh KLM into a single uh new commitstarting with k remove L&M all right sodo it again get rebase I head till the3do these ones uh SS there we go and gointo kthere we go Bam Bam Bam Bam got thosetwo uh we are rewriting the history ofour own uh Branch let's see to make itlook as if we did all the work in asingle Commit This is normal and finebecause it's our Branch yes it's ourBranch now it's okay to do right nowit's okay before it wasn't okay to doand we did it on Main which we shouldn'thave done it on Main butit's give me something to talk aboutgive me a reason not to do that ourBranch all right so now we're going todo four and five uh use get push to addscanner and open a PO request all rightget push origin uh add scanner there wego we're going to do that and we'regoing to go to back end we're going togo to GitHub the prime gen which updateMega Corp and there wego Prequests new pullrequest addscanner let's go create pull requestcreate it let's go looking goodlooking good oh my goodness how do younot have my repo name I thought you hadit all right I'm just going to copy thatone and bring it back in here and go theprimagen there we go and run allchecks oh am I doing it oh uh to main onyour mega Corp oh crap I did on I did iton your mega Corp I didn't read theinstructions good I in fact did not readgood instructions hereI in facted terrible instructionsreading there we gouh apparently I can't change uh where myremote is pointingto which is kind of weird that's fineGitHub the prime engine um mega Corpthere we go so I effed it up I effed itup apparently the UI doesn't let youchange the base reading instructions arerequired for squares yeahlosers add scanner there we go sorry theprevious one didn't require me torequired me to do it on a different oneso it got me a little bitconfused all right there we go merge thepoll request remember we did all thatone now let's tle pack point six mergeyour pull request from uh ad scannerinto main you can also do so by clickingthe Big Green merge request button uhwhen you're done you switch back to mainbranch locally here's the scary partdelete your local ad scanner Branch pullthe latest change it from Main and yourlocal main branch should have a nowcommit K yeah some people get freakedout it's okay when you have centralizedmerge stuff it's not a big deal hit thebig green button confirm the merge getcheck out main get Branch Big D deleteadd scanner right boom get it out get uhpull oh mygosh I didn't set I didn't set thatthere we go get pull my Branch wasn'tpulled there we go look at thatgood yeah there we go we got the energywe got it all done absolutely fantasticit's all in allright wait did that mean I did it[Music]okay stash all right so now we're goingon to stash are you guys ready for somestash all right you've been at Mega corfor a while three whole days and to yourmother surprise you're still employedhere's the workflow you've been using asa junior developer commit some let's seecommit some changes to a feature branchopen a poll request from that featureBranch to Maine check out the newfeature branch and and start back to thenext task today however is a big day allright today is a big let's see big daylet's see the customers are complainingabout a critical bug and the CEO saw youfirst she asked you to drop everythingand fix it immediately but you've got abunch of unstaged changes that you'renot ready to commit yet and you don'twant to lose what do many git noobswould create a second clone of the gitrepo at this point a huge mistake you'rebetter than that that's right you arebetter than that uh the get stashcommand records the current state ofyour working directory and the indexstaging area it's kind of like yourcomputer's copy paste clipboard itrecords those changes in a safe placeand reverts the working directory tomatch the head commit the last commit onyour current Branch to stash yourcurrent changes do get stash yeah andstash list to list your changes don'tlook at that my stashing workflow looksa little something like this I usuallyhave some amount of work that's in myindex or my work tree and I get arequest in that says hey can you pleaseinvestigate this bug or hey you need topull in the latest changes because ifyou pull in the latest changes thefeature you're developing will have acouple extra apis that you need whichmeans I'm going to have to take mychanges create a commit pull in the newchanges finish off the change I wantedto make create another commit thensquash those two commits into one or Icould just stash my work tree and myindex pull in the changes and then popoff my stash when I need to get back todoing what I was doing and finish thechange I was trying to make now the thetimes that I don't do that approach thetimes that I don't choose stash whichoften I do is whenever I had to pull ina change but I'm already in severalcommits into a change I'm trying to maketypically I try to keep my changespretty small but every now and thenyou'll have like a thousand line changeand whenever I have a big change likethat I try to make small commits alongthe way as nice checkpoints in case Iscrew something up so bad that I canjust roll back to the last known workingcommit and then start again so if thathappens I simply make another temporarycommit rebase in my changes and then atthe end of everything I'm doing Ialready have worked in that I'm going tosquash everything down to one commitanyway so it doesn't bother me all rightassignment while on Main updatereadme.md in the root of megga Cort repoto do this one B bam just after updatingread me uh that the CEO approached youstash the changes once you're stashedmake sure that they are uh safe in yourlist let's see they are safe by listingnow it's okay you would be able tosingle see a single stash list okay allright um let's go into here let's go toread me uh let's let's see let's deletethat and go to thisone there we go GS we have look at thislook at this we have our read me but bamwe got to stash some changes so I'mgoing to jump in here and go uh so forthose that don't know get stash all itdoes uh is it takes whatever you weredoing and puts it into like a specialarea it's kind of like uh it's kind oflike it it's kind of like a commit uh soif I look at get status you'll noticethere's nothing there get stash list uhyou'll notice that there is one righthere if we go get stash list I believeit's- P you can see the change righthere right it's just like a specialplace to be able to put changes for amoment I never use it longterm if youuse it long term you're crazy don't dothat that's absolutely nutty todo right absolute nutty to do all rightstash has a few options get stash poplist the pop command will by default uhapply your most recent stash ENT to yourworking directory and remove it from thestash list it is effectively UND doesthe stash command it gets you back towhere you were this is called a stackand that's important okay pop your stashchange back out you should see itworking get stash uh pop so it's a stackand that's really really important toknow because if you push two things ontop of your stash you will have yourlatest one on top the stash commandstores your changes uh in a stack Phodata structure also I wouldn't say uh Iwouldn't say Pho okay I'm last in firstout I'm more of a lifo kind of personLane again your copy editing hurts myfeelings here I'm a lifo not a pho ornot a I'm a lifo not a pho yeah for surethat means that whenever you retrieveyour changes from the stash you alwaysget the most recent changes that's truebada bam uh Pho is greater than lifo WLane false all right stash is acollection of changes that you have notcommitted they might be raw workingdirectory changes or they might be stagechanges both can be stash for exampleexample make some changes to yourworking directory stash those changesmake some more CH let's see make somemore changes without stage them stashall of that when you do that the stashentry will contain both staged andunstaged changes and both your workingdirectory and index will be reverted tothe state of your last commit it's veryconvenient way to pause your work andcome back later git stash is a veryconvenient feature of git in whichallows you to store your index and yourwork tree into a special area known asthe stash and then later on to be ableto pop off those changes and reapplythem to your work tree /indexbut what is the stash well it's a datastructure that is a stack so everysingle time you have a change to yourindex SL workor tree and you want tosave it for later when you call G stashit actually creates something that'slike a commit and adds it to this datastructure pushes it onto the stash stackany files that were not a part of yourindex slthe work tree will simply beignored when you call get stash pop it'sactually going to take the last thingthat you added to the stash and apply itto your current work tree /index X thatmeans if you stash three changes a bthen C if you pop something off you'llbe popping off C then the next time youpop off it will be B then the final timeyou pop off it will be a if you'reunfamiliar with a stack it's actuallypretty simple think of a stack of platesif I add a plate then add a plate thenadd a plate if I wish to remove a plateI would never try to grab from thebottom IID just grab one from the topthen the next one then the next oneWhatever order you put in is the reverseorder of what you take out in otherwords it's a last in first out datastructure you can inspect your git stashby simply executing git stash list whichwill show you in the order in which youpop out your stashes often I use thestash in a very one-dimensional way Ihave some changes that I need to pull infrom Main so I'm going to stash mycurrent changes pull them in pop off mycurrent changes and continue on my workI never use the stash as like along-term storage place just because mycode changes so fast that it often getsout of date super quick what is notstaged unchanged uh unstaged changes tothe track let's see to the trackedworking directory stag changes committedchanges you can't stage a commit okayyou can't triple triple stamp a doublestamp if you push three sets of changesinto the stack let's call the first onea the next B the last one C what happenswhen you run get stash pop the changesfrom C are applied to your workingdirectory but the stash entry is notremoved the changes from c i rememberclicking this last time it got me thischanges from C are applied to hereworking directly and the stash entry isremoved let's go multiple stashes youcan stash changes with a message Irarely use stash in fact I never usestash messages that I can remember I'veused it like once or twice the bigreason why I don't do that is wheneveryou're doing this this means that youactually want to come back much laterwhich to me just says this needs to be abranch in which you keep somewhere andthen you can edit the commit if you wantto you can rebase the commit uh for mestashing is a very very like temporaloperation assignment restash the changesto readme with the message goodmarketing update the readme uh fileagain with the following contentsright get stash uh message uh goodmarketing boom right and so we're goingto go back here and I'm going to godelete and I'm going to have thisone there we go now let's see stashthose changes with bad marketing uh getstashbad marketing there we go and now weshould do a stash list get stash listyou can see these two different onesright here so that means if you add a pin here you can see the difference uniteMarketing sales and service in a singleapp try Mega Corp starter Suite todaythere is nothing uh to install no creditcard required the only thing standingbetween you and more customers are youare your terrible salespeople getstartedtoday it's a pretty good that's a prettygood one that's feels good feels goodall right so there we go all rightunrelated commit now that you've safelystashed your current work let's tacklethe CEO's urgent matter CG uh Megacorpse APO script or shell script trulyis a feet of engineering it behavesexactly as the shell borne shelllanguage but with the word let's see butif the word shell or sh is evermentioned in the standard out it willreplace it with APO it's a feature thatcustomers love but it's not workinglet's see test by running scan with theAPO language for Shell there we go we'regoing to grab this onethere we go so you can see it righthere it's all right there okay uh thegrap command let's see the grab commandshould filter out the output to thelines that contain sh uh you should seea couple lines which means APO sh isn'tdoing its job uh the culprit is thisline yeah yeah it should be replacedwith SH not bash all right we're goingto update the script we're going toupdate the script right all right let'supdate the script man customers lovejust the craziest things huh uh scriptsApothere wego wait asecond there it is we got the Apex okayyou're right get status get add this getcommit get commit L the L stands forlovely reading theprimin there we go all right now that wegotthat apply without removing from thestash so you can actually do that I'mnot really sure the purpose of this butit does exist uh you can apply withoutor you can you can remove from stashwithout applying this makes more senseLane W Prim L yeah I know it happenedreference a specific stash so you canactually do it in one of these locationswith the at sign so that means weprobably we're going to have to do theone run uh get stash list see what uhsee the stashes you have apply thechanges from good marketing stash indexwithout REM moving it from the stashlist so we just have to do a littleapply do one of these bad boys get stashlist um paste that in there one there wego uh get add your changes to the indexdrop good marketing stash pop the onlyremaining one bad marking you shouldnotice that you have a conflict

whoopsies uh hold on get whathappened get status did I miss whathappened here uh Vim read me there we goI missed the message that said it it didthe wrong thing so there we go I'm goingto remove the bad marketing one call ita get I missed the conflict message howdid I miss that oh it's right there itwas right there the whole time I justmissant again it's that reading thingyou know what Imean okay it's that reading thing thatreally gets me[Music]okay all rightrevert when reset is a sledgehammerrevert is a scalpel uh revert iseffectively an anti- commit it does notremove the commit like reset but insteadcreates a new commit that does the exactopposite of the commit being reverted itundoes the change but keeps the fullhistory of the change and it's undoingso it's kind of like the Spider-Manthing you know I mean grug reading for aliving but grug no read yeah I knowit's sometimes you feel right all rightto revert a commit you need to know whatcommit the are the commit hash of thecommit you want to revert you can do itwith Git log all right and once you haveit you do a little get revert hash witha committes assignment uh in your greathaste of pursuit of greatness at MegaCorp you forgot to write a white paperand get approval from the l69distinguished staff architect for yourmarketing documentation change the l69has requested you revert the change andsure you are on Main revert commit M itshould prompt you to write a commitmessage and we're going to call it nlet's do it allright so we're going to go like this uhget log one line so what do we need weneed this guy right here bam getrevert that one and save get log on lineyou can see right here here looks likethis get log um on line-P2 so look at this you can you can seethat it's literally the inversion of itthe starter repo for the G course 2 thatone removed it this one added it backthis one added this this one removed itthis one added that that one removed itso it's like an inversion so that's whata revertdoes it literally does like ananti-matter commit to your history andthen it turns it into a commit so youactually have it as a part of your graphOh shoot that's notright right that's notright that's not right did I mess thatup I must have messed that up yeah seeit says get revert M okay that's my baduh get commit uhamend allright there wego that was my fault that was my faultstill doesn't read I still I literallycannot read the get diff command showsyou the difference between stuffdifferences between commits and theworking tree Etc I frequently use it tolook at changes between the currentstate of my code and the last commmentum I use it to look at I I primarily useit to look not at that I primar well Imean yes actually that's exactly I mycurrent state sorry that red funny whatmy current changes are I rarely use itfor uh staged stuff if you want to dostage you have to do dash dash staged uhshow the changes between the working Trethe last commit uh you can do that youcan do difference between branches youcan do difference between two hashesI've tried to do this for bigger ones inbigger projects once you get to acertain size it's like impossible diffthe changes between n and M commitsremember n is the version of changes andpaste the full output in here get diffuh a head till one I believe is all Ineed todo Ithink I can'tremember submit boom yeah there we gobro do you even diff I diff I diff okayjust copy P into notepad Plus+ with thedifferences extension wait what whywould you do that revert versus resetreset soft undoes the Comm but keeps theuh stage changes undoes the commit anddiscards the changes revert creates anew commit and undoes the previouscommit there you go when to reset ifyou're working on your own branch andyou're just undoing something you'vealready committed say you're cleaningeverything up so you can open a pollrequest then get reset is probably whatyou want however if you want to undochange that's already on the sharedbranch especially if it's an olderchange then get revert is the saferoption it won't rate any history andtherefore you won't step on yourco-worker toes don't look at that don'tlook at it when do you use reverseversus reset well they're actually quitedifferent operations so you just need tounderstand them fundamentally and it'llbecome obvious when you use one versusthe other whenever I use reset it'sbecause I want to be able to take acommit undo that commit make some editsand recommit and in the case of getreset hard I actually just want to throwaway that commit this means I'm workingon my own Branch not on a brancheverybody else uses I'm able to edit thehistory and get it into the way I wouldlike it to be whereas a revert is morefor the public Branch what this means isthat you have a problematic commit andyou need to be able to remove thatcommit but you could never do that to apublic branches it's going to breakeverybody so instead you make like ananti-matter commit right this commitcontains changes a this one revertschanges a and this also has the addedbenefit that if you want to go back intime you can go back to a and actuallyfix the bug and then reintroduce a alongwith its bug fix now I find that Irevert when I'm on a larger team becauseoften you're in this position wherewhere somebody needs this change to goout such that a new customer feature ora new Ab test that's high priority hasto get out but your changes have brokenthe build and we're not discovered untilwe released into production so we needthem out right away there is no waitingthere is no waiting to fix forward sotherefore you simply revert your commitfix the change create a new commit withthe fixed code and all the changes backin and then next release your code cango out and hopefully it's not broken butif you find yourself reverting a lotit's likely because you have a prettyunhealthy process your cicd is not up toSnuff your tests aren't quite there yourautomation is no good production is theultimate place to test but it should notbe the only place you test which createsa new commit revert let's go Whichrewrites history[Music]reset all right there we go cherry pickeveryone loves cherry pick this comes atime in every developer's life when youwant to yink a commit from a brand butyou don't want to merge or rebasebecause you don't want all the commitsget cherry pick is another one of thesevery useful git operations but youinfrequently need to use it cherry pickis when you want one change from abranch but you don't want the entirehistory of the branch you only just wantsay a singular commit or two commitsWhere cherry pick is obviously useful iswhen you have a branch that's calledrelease and then you have your maindevelopment line every now and thenrelease gets cut and that Branch getsupdated now let's pretend you've beengoing in their there's hundreds ofcommit in Maine but we discover a bug inproduction well we can fix the bug inMaine and then just transfer over thatone in singular commit to release andthen reproducti release thus fixing thebug but we don't contain all of thechanges from Maine because those changesare largely untested or may they containhalf-baked features that are not readyto go out quite yet so This Is Wherecherry pick Works a switch to a newBranch off of Main called ad Partnersupdate the partners organization to bethis one commit the changes with oupdate the same file again with P allright let's do that uh all right getBranch let's see what branches I haveall right cool get uh check out dasbstill not doing it still not using itLane was just like we should use switchand I was like dude I'm all About That Cabout that c get check out I just didn'tI can't help it I can't help it I I justI just haveto all right there we go won't sub ifyou don't use switch nope then don't subI'll ban you how about that one howabout that one tough guy get commit d ookay the setup we're going to do thesetup myface oh than wait yes so now we got todo p all right uh Vim Partners uh dappaste let's go here get status getstatus get add get commitdasp on the electric fence huh littlecall back to Ren and Stimpy I think Ispelled fence wrong whatever that'sclose enough you know what we're closeenough that's a little Ren and Stimpycall back okay it's been a long timesince I've watched some Ren Stimpy okayclose it enough all right what theme ofV code is this you know exactly whattheme it is can read norwrite all right how to cherry pick uhfirst you need to clean uh clean workingtree no one committed changes identifythe commit you want to cherry picktypically with get log is a good one runget cherry pick commit or commit wouldbe better get log to grab the first uhof the two commits we just made ohthat's the one we want get log there wego I'm going to grab this bad boy myoace then we're going to go in herecherry pick o on to main ensure that itlet's see it worked by checking thepartners one delete add Partnersboom get Cherry uh pickthat oh I just did it onto my own thingget uh get status it uh I didn't evenchange branches uh abort abortabort boom oh my goodness I have arevert in Pro oh mygoodness wait how am I how do I have arevert in progress how did I do thatokay when when when did I dothis all right hold on uh get log allright so I have the revert right hereall right so that's already beencommitted so that's not a problem get uhget Branch we have our two branches I'monMain uh let's see no Cherry pit oh Ihave a board am I actually calling aortoh dude I'm so stupid I didn't even seethat I was doing aort okay I am reallynot reading it's been a long day I don'tknow if you guys know this but I've beenstreaming for track hours nine hoursokay it's been a long day all rightthere we go so I moved over this righthere so I can go get log DP so we cansee right here closed ml one of ourfavorite startups right can't even readthe timer okay shut up shut up it's beenso long I'm not good at doing this muchthis much stuff at a time all right weneed to delete the ad partners get uhBranch delete ad Partners there we gothe man's losing I've lost it I fullylost it I've lost it I've lostit let's go first[Music]try oh yeah we're up to bisect do youlike bisect you guys you guys want a BCTall right so bisect is fantastic let'sdo this okay let's do this get bisect isyet another get command that does soundquite intimidating to the uninitiatedbut once you learn how works it isactually quite simple get bisect allowsyou to find a commit in which introduceda bug really fast and it does this byusing a technique called binary searchlet's just pretend that we have a branchthat has many commits on it our latestcommit contains a bug and a 100 commitsago does not contain the bug how are yougoing to find when the bug wasintroduced well you could go step bystep through it until you find where thebug's at but that would be tedious if ittakes couple minutes per try it couldtake all afternoon or multiple days butsince commits are ordered by time inwhich they are merged we can actuallypretend they are an ordered array and doa binary search across it so this is howgit bisect Works let's pretend that wehave a known state that is bad and aknown state that is good and we have abunch of commits in between all of thiswe'll call it X amounts of commits if wetest the middle commit and let's pretendwe found this middle commit is good weknow that all of this is good in otherwords we've cut our space in half wehave x / 2us 1 left commits to check andif we repeat the process we can continueon finding smaller and smaller regionsto go check for our commits if we findone of these are actually bad then weknow that all of this direction is badand we repeat this process until we'reable to find a singular commit that isthe commit in which the bug wasintroduced if x was a th000 it wouldapproximately take us 10 checks to findthe bug and using git bisect is reallysimple you set the good commit you setthe bad commit you say start and it willstart doing that exact same process ofcutting the known space in half askingyou if this commit is good or bad if youanswer good then it knows all thecommits earlier are good if you answerbad it knows all the commits that areahead are bad this can save you days ofsearching so we know how to fix problemsin our code we can either revert thecommit with a uh the bug this is morecommon on large teams or fail forward byjust writing a new commit that fixes thebu this is more common on small teamswell it's if you have the time that'sthe this is the ideal in my head is tobe able to always fail forwardright that is my favorite uh but there'sanother question how do we find wherethe bug was introduced that's where getbisect command comes in instead ofmanually checking all the commits that'sBig O O right Big O N I mean get bisectallows us to do a binary search which islogin so that means after like what10,000 it's only 14 checks it's the wayto go so if you don't know how to dobisect you bisect is fantastic if you'reworking on a slightly old code base thathas thousands or hundreds ofcommits right all right let's see BCTisn't just for bugs you can do anythingso the nice part about this is anytimeyouhave a change you're looking for and youhave a script that you cancheck then bi sector can be used to findwhere that say Improvement andperformance Improvement was Edintroduced performance uh regression wasintroduced anything so bisect isfantastic the B the purpose of bisect isto split the repositories into twoseparate repositories split the commitinto two find a commit that introduced abug or change say it that way uh acommit to find a change that wasintroduced there are seven effectivesteps to bisecting that's it there'sonly a quick seven now you know you knowme from reading right am I right youknow my skills at reading so we're aboutto go deep on this one okay yeah yeahall right start the bisect with getbisect start select a good commit selecta bad commit uh get will check thecommits between them and find it executeuh get BCT good or bad to say thecurrent commit is good or bad uh loopback to step four exit with this one getbisect receip or uhreset there we go assignment your bossjust chewed you out because the scan ash script should never have been addedto the repo not only does she want thecontents of the script erased but shewants to know when the script was addedand for you to fix it with get revert sothe history of your Royal screw up ispreserved considering you can't rememberwhen you wrote the script you decided touse get bisect start BCT you know thehead commit is bad so Market is bad youknow the first commit a is good so markit as a if the script content is pres uhpresent not just a to-do comment Markthe script as bad otherwise mark it asgood repeat step four until get bisectcompletes it should give you the hash ofthe commit all right so this should bepretty easy do you understandhere right boss should have been in coderiew yeah I know boss boss yapping butboss wasn't wasn't reviewing that's whatI'm seeing right now people lot ofyapping not a lot oflooking uh allright let's see revert the commit thatintroduced the script with commitmessage P am I right am I right allright so let's find out when thathappens so we're going to go like thisI'm going to do the following I'm goingto go get uh Buyuh um start right so we're going tostart it waiting for both good and badcommits so I'm going to go get a BCT uhbad so that just says oh did I BCT therewe go I literally could not see thedifference there bad so you don'tactually have to provide a commit if youwant to use the current one so there wego I just used the current one uh getlog one line go all the way down to thebottom get uh BCT good we know issomewhere right there so now notice thatit has six rever Visions left uh to testafter this roughly threesteps so we can go we can go cat uhscripts scan word count line all rightso there is one line so this was justthe to-do right so when it has one lineit is the to-do okay so that would beget bisect good we like that one thisone has 10 lines so that one's bad thisone'sbad all right this one's so this one'salso badall right this one's good I'll explainwhat's happening in more detail here fora second there we go you can see exactlywhere this has happened and you can evensee right here K credits so all right Ithink this is good uh get log DP thisthing you can even see right here thisis where the changes were made to the uhscan script so what actually happenedthere it's actually not that bad you canimagine that at a that's our firstcommit and I forget what our uh head isright whatever commit that washead how a bisect actually works is thatremember each Commhas an ordering to it this is an orderedarray therefore the ordering of coursebeing merge order or it's going to belike say time and so that means we'regoing to go b c and all the way up tohead that means if we check the middleelement and it's bad that means thisentire side is bad but if we check themiddle element and it's good that meansthis entire side is good so since thefirst one was good we know that all ofwe know that all of thislet's see hold on shoot which one isthat if we know this one was good weknow that the rest of these were goodright here so that means we went in themiddle of this one so then when wechecked here and it was bad we knew thatall of these were bad so then we wentinto the middle right here and when wechecked this one since it was bad aswell we knew that all these are bad sowe went and checked right here and sincethat one was good then either the oneright after it since there's only onecommit left between these two it wasable to say that this one was the badone it's a binary search that'seffectively whathappened right sorry for my fairlyshoddy explanation but that's all it isbisect is really simple right it's it'sit's really easy you can think of thislike an ordered array imagine you havean array that goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 andyou wanted to find out if it has thenumber six well what you could do is ifthis is zero and this would be uh8 rightthe ending it's of length eight youcould do 8 minus 0 ID two which givesyou four and you can check this one isthis six no it's not is it greater thanit is since it's greater we need tocheck this one okay that means we needto update our lower bound to this one sonow that's going to be three 0 1 2 3 westill have eight as the length so we doit again what is 8 - 3 / 2 which isgoing to be what two 2 and a half twothen add it to three so we got to go tofive which is going to be four five isthis one it yes it is we're done saywe're looking for seven then we do theexact same thing again which we'd haveto go to Five 8 - 5 is 1 divide by twothat or that's three divid by two that'sone add it to one all right seven checkhere is this it yes it isgood so that's all it is it's prettyeasy um binary search is really reallyeasy to do right and it's great it'sactually really really great so that'sall bisect was doing was that so nowthat we have that we're going to go likethis uh get uh BCTuhreset oh my goodness BCT I I I can'tread that word get uh revert thatonep there wego sounds like successive approximationwell whenever you have an order you cansearch the space more efficiently givenan input if you don't have an order youcannot search space efficiently that'swhy things like uh that's why eventuallyyou just have to do a linear searchthrough everything if you have no orderlinear is quote unquote slow linear isslow but it's not as bad as likequadratic or uh even more that wasannoying now imagine if testing wasn'tas simple as just looking at a filemanually running an automated test cantake a long time as compiling uh a gaspJ Java Enterprise project absolutely uhfor the man get BCT you can do bisectrun now this is cool okay bisect runallows you to be able to do that processwe just did but in an automated way nowthis is very importantbecause sometimes you have to sit therefor 30 minutes for something to tell youif it's correct or not so it's muchnicer to be able to just have this thingrun and then you go play I don't knowplay game basketball whatever you do I'mnot sure what you do okay so there wego there we go let's create a new scriptin scripts called BCT sh with thiscontents so that means if we findscanning in the scan we exit with a badexit codeif we don't find it we exit with a goodexit code in other words uh BCT when yourun it uses the exit code to determineif it's a good or bad build so let's goinhere Vim this thing up go into scriptsgo BCT Dosh go in here do that make itexecutable uh I prefer to hit a oh yeahI guess I don't need to do I don't needto do a shebang there wego and now I need I can gointo here and do the exact same thingand I can run this script now so I cango like this we already chimed it we cando a bisc start and go get uh get BCT uhstart getBCT bad get BCT good that there we go sowe have our head to our tail and nowwe're going to run through and do thisthing even though technically we'redoing a bad with our current one youknow there's a little bit of somethingweird here so I can go cuz we revertedit so technically our head break ourwhole ordering but don't worry about itwe we can skip that get bisect run umscripts bisect and I believe we don'tneed to yeah there we go we don't needto provide any arguments so when we dothis one there we go it found it is ableto run that script super fast and findit immediately there we go and now weknow where the problem was see bisect ispretty cool what does automating bisectrequire uh an automated test that canprogrammatically inform git if thecurrent commit is good or bad that'spretty much it there we goall right work trees uh we've beensaying work tree all throughout thiscourse but I have been misusing it I amsorry it's not technically what we're onis not called it's not work treeprecisely uh it's the main work treewhich is more precise because you canhave more than one working tree what isa work tree a work tree or a workingtree or working directory is just thedirectory on your file system where thecode you are tracking with Git livesusually it's just the root of your gitrepo where the dogit repo is it containstracked files untracked files modifiedfiles right everyone know everyone canfundamentally understand what a worktree is your main working tree justmakes sense the work tree command get asa work tree command that allows you towork the work trees the first subcommandwe'll worry about is simple get worktree list it lists all the working treesyou created all right so let's see whatworking trees we'vecreated you'll notice there's only oneworkingtree rightyeah which is my current my current worktree right linked work trees uh we'vetalked about stash temporary storage forchanges branches parallel lines ofdevelopment clone copying an entire repowork trees accomplish a similar goalallow you to work on different changeswithout losing work but are particularlyuseful when you want to switch back andforth between two change sets withouthaving to run a bunch of git commandsnot branches or stash you want to keep alight foot print on your machine that'sstill connected to the main repo not aclone so this work trees effectivelyallow you not to have to clone out arepo for a second version of it there'ssome like requirements there's somerules I think I go over the exact rulesin here the main work tree contains agit directory that's important with theentire state of the repo heavy lots ofdata in there to get a new main workingtree requires get clone or get a knit uha link work tree contains a git filewith a path to the main working treeit's effectively as light you can thinkof it as almost as light as a branchit's just like a little bit heavier thanabranch U let's see uh can be complicatedto work with when it comes to end filesand secrets this is where things kind ofusually go off the rails for work treesis work trees can be a pain in the buttwhen you have uh say node modules nodemodules can be really annoying so we cancreate a new work tree like this we dothis uh whenever you do a path on an adif you do not include a branch name ittakes the the uh first baster of thepath and uses that as the branch nameand it'll actually create it so we cancreate a linked working tree uh as asister directory to your main workingtree called alra Corp uh use the defaultUltra Corp Branch so watch this so I cango uh oopsies uh get uh get a bict uhreset forgot to dothat get a work uh tree ad what is itit's path which is going to be let'scall it UltraCorp there we go so prepared to new worktree it's called alra Corp so if I gohere back out and go Ultra Corp you'llnotice that Ultra Corp is on Branch alraCorp because that was the Bas that wasthe first base dur of the path that Idid so if I would have done like UltraCorp SL fuar then the branch would havebeenbar if that makes sense and so now if Igo like this cat get you'll notice it'sliterally just a pointer to where itneeds to be right so there it isprimagen personal Mega Cort get worktrees Ultra Corp so it's saying whereit's located at pretty coolright I've been programming for 12 yearsand I like to think of get as magicunder the hood it's really it's it'sit's shockingly it's not the mostcomplicated piece ofsoftware I'm sure the actual operationsfor like creating and deleting files andstuff like that is complicated buteverything else is uh like how it worksis actually not like the most oh my goshhow could this possiblyberight all right no duplicate brancheslinked work trees uh behave like normalget repos you can create branches switchbranches delete branches create tags Etcbut there is one thing you cannot do youcannot work on the branch that iscurrently checked out by another treebranch navigate to ultra Corp attempt toswitch tomain so when I try to switch out main itsays already used rightmakes sense right yeah tracking so howdoes your main tree uh main working treeknow about your linked working tree wellthe reference is stored in G work treesdirectory list the contents of thisdirectory so if we go like this if we goto here and go uh ls- La get work treesthis is a new one you'll notice thatUltra Corp is right here so if I go inhere you'll notice that it haseffectively the entirety of everythingyou need to know about it where its headis pointing it's like a mini little it'slike a little mini git experiences goingon right here here and even has a g durand you'll notice that the G dur if welook at it will actually be like theinversion of the other onewhoopsies there we go oh my goodness howdid I get that there we go it's the pathto where we're going so that's how itknow it exists that's why when I go worktree list it's able to actually findthis if I were to delete Ultra Corp it'actually say like dead or prune orsomething like that removed I forgetwhat it says but it says something howdoes the work tree keep track of it themain working let's see the work Tredirectory contains references to themyep Mega corpse IT staff manually logsit in Juro their project managersoftware actual magic which one isit all right when you make a change in alinked work tree the change isautomatically reflected in the main worktree it makes sense the linked work treedoesn't have a g directory so it's not aseparate repository it's just adifferent view of the same repositoryyou can almost think of a linked worktree as just another branch in the samerepo but with its own space on the filesystem run get branch on your main worktree uh and answer the question so if Iclick this get Branch look at that youcan even see the little plus sign rightthere that's because it's being checkedout in a worktree it's kind of fun thing uh how canyou tell if a branch has checked out uhin a different work tree uh the branchwill have no prefix that has a plusprefix let's go plus prefix let's godeleting work trees you may never needthe stash again this is the nice partabout working with work trees is youdon't actually ever need the stash everagain you can have two work trees thatare always you know you can switchbetween them you can always check out anew one every time you work on a branchI had somebody at my old uh job tell methat stashing or switching branches isan anti- pattern you should just alwayswork tree um anyways however at somepoint you need to clean up your worktrees the simplest way was to remove thesubcommand you can do a remove but youcan also do something cooler which Iactually prefer you can just delete thedirectory watch this one uh let's seehold on does it say that remove alraCorp cool get uh rmrf backback alra Corpthere we go so if I go get work treelist again you can see this right heresee prunable I knew it said something Icouldn't remember the word it said butnow that means if I go get work treeprune it's able to tell what to prunebecause remember when we did this whenwe CED the gter ultra Corp had adirectory so when it goes and it goeshere it cats out this thing it statsthat file when that file doesn't existthen it knows that it doesn't work thatthis thing has been detached what aboutnpn modules you have that I mean you cancopy you can create a script right Ijust I talked about that the wholeenvironment part of work trees can bedifficultright there we gobam I always had like two or threeworking trees and I would actually justswitch between them so whenever I neededto do something I could actually justgrab that and change itall right tags uh we're going to wrap upthis course with an easy one tags tagsagain I showed this at the verybeginning of the course tags has thecraziest user manual but it's so simpleto list all the tags you can just do gettag so get tag I have no tags very veryeasy tag is just an immutable pointer toacommit very very nice we can create atag by just doing this tag a give it atag name give it a message all of thatall right create a tag on the latestcommit p with the name candidate and adescriptive message all right get tag uha see so we can go get tag- a if youwant a name so the name can becandidate like that right and then youcan do a message message suchcandidcandidate boom get tag look at thatbeauty right there you can you can alsoif I'm not mistaken you can also createa uh tag without having to dothisright there you go you don't have to usea a it's like the default firstparameter there we go now tags rememberyou cannot edit a tag so when I checkout a tag get check out tag let's youget check out candidate I go into adetached head State like you can't makeedits to a tag tags are immutablepointers it's very important to rememberthat and also one last thing get log oneline you can also see uh tagswhen you have decorations which is nicewhy would one use a tag oh very verysimple let's go like this let's go to uhGitHub uh react let's just go check outthe react Library let's check out whattags theyhave tags do those lookfamiliar if you've kept track at allreact server components exist in 18right people typically use tags to pointto versions that are released in publicso this is like a very normal BehaviorUh that you should see tags for they'reusually some sortofrelease uh now you can do stuff withsver this is typically how people dothis with just sver it's kind of weirdto just name tags any old thing we'redevelopers we like structure samenessand sometimes even bike shedding I lovebike Shing sver semantic versioning is aname and Convention by the way I've beenbit so hard by sver because of this oneright here minor sometimes it isn't asafe feature if people change defaultparameters just so you know defaultparameters don't technically break majorversioning of sver and can screw youjust so you know just in case you'rewondering note V isn't actually a partof the sver correct major this means achange to the API in which will breakcompiling code minor means a an additivechange to the API that won't break acode patch means no change to the API atall there yougo um that's the easiest way to say ituh the sort let's see to sort them fromhighest to lowest uh you first comparethe major versions then a major minorversions then finally patch versions forexample major version 2 is alwaysgreater than major version oneregardless of the minor versionabsolutely if I'm using some code that'son V1 124 and I see a new version 224 isavailable should I expect to be able tosafely upgrade without making anychanges to use it no major versions arenot backwardscompatible or typically are not majorare not backwards compatiblegood thing to know you know what I meangood thing to know what's the highestversion 422 422 let's go I'm so good atthis I'm so good at this conventionaltags um tags are used for all sorts ofreasons but sometimes they're used to uhto denote releases in that case tagsfollow the sver are common right here sotags this is very normal right fun factpretty much anywhere you can use acommit hash you can use a tag uh namewhen working with Git right it's acommit let's see assignment add anothertag to this let's see to the same latestcommit right commits going have multipletags which we already did and then therewe go boom uh get tag V 1.0.0 that'd belike oopsies that'd be like a normal oneget push uh tags there we go push themall up let'sgo gotit tags okay guys stop making fun of mytags there we go we're done I just didtwo git courses thank you very very muchI hope you enjoyed this presentation ofboot dodev GS course in which I helpedcreate quite a bit thename is the primagen boot. deprime useit",
    "summary": "This YouTube video is a comprehensive walkthrough of two Git courses offered by Boot.dev, led by the \"Prime Engine\". The first course focuses on Git for solo developers, covering essential concepts like setting up Git, understanding repositories, branches, merging, rebasing, remotes, and ignoring files using .gitignore. It emphasizes hands-on learning with interactive lessons and projects, advising users to experiment independently before watching the instructor's approach.\n\nThe second course delves into advanced Git techniques for team collaboration. Topics include forking, ref log usage, merge conflicts, rebase conflicts, squashing, stashing, reverting, cherry-picking, bisecting, work trees, and tagging. The video highlights the importance of understanding Git internals and how Git stores entire snapshots of files per commit, optimizing storage through compression and de-duplication. It also covers essential Git commands like `status`, `add`, `commit`, and `log`, plus valuable configuration options, branching strategies, and merging techniques. Furthermore, the courses touch upon resolving merge conflicts, using `reflog` for recovering lost work, understanding remote repositories, and leveraging GitHub for collaborative version control.\n\nThe video also highlights some more intermediate and advanced topics such as bisect, worktrees, gitignore, git commit amend, git reset soft, and RERE (reuse recorded resolutions). Bisect allows someone to search large repositories for a commit where a change was introduced, worktrees allows someone to work in two different worktrees at the same time, gitignore will help prevent adding things that are not needed, git commit amend and git reset soft are useful for fixing up local changes before pushing to a remote, and RERE will reuse recorded resolutions for common merge conflicts, such as when rebasing in particular."

    "transcript": "well the name is the primagen uh I'm sohappy to be here I cannot believe LELhas allowed me to have a microphone boldand risky strategies but I think it'sgoing to pay off uh but but real talk Idon't know what it is maybe it's the tapwater maybe it's just the heat but PHPpeople are just the nicest people of anydeveloperCommunity it's just true and I thinklurel is even the nicer subset I don'tknow what it is but it's just sofantastic so thank you so much forletting me be here thank you for lettingme talk uh I'm extremely grateful forthat and I do want to thank my beautifulwife she's not watching she's probablynot going to watch this I don't reallylike it when she watches my stuff butthank you beautiful wife appreciate youuh the kids again I just do all of thisbecause I have kids to do it for and Ithank you and of course God for lettingme have a second chance at lifeso all right so uh I'm going to tell astory it might sound a little bit likehumble bragging so please you got towalk with me for a second it's not meantto be that way but uh it's just how it'sgoing to come out so when I joinedNetflix in 2013 By the way Aaron got itwrong it was 10 years and then a half ayear not 10 years and then five moreyears so uh I've been there I was inthere December 2013 I was 27 years oldand I got hired on as a senior softwareengineer now I've only been out ofschool at that point for about 3 yearsand uh I've only been employed for abouta year and a half so I wasn'tnecessarily senior software engineeringmaterial and not only that but theyoungest person on my team was about 32years old so Not only was I not a seniorsoftware engineer I was about 5 yearsyounger than everybody there's 40 peopleon my team and I just felt massivelylike somehow I Bamboozled them to let mejust come there and actually work onstuff but for whatever reason they letme come and I had the opportunity tokind of join at the beginning of a hugeproject it was about a 9mon project andwe had to deliver an entirely newexperience on Netflix so since I wasthere a little bit later I didn't havethe seniority they gave me the worst jobwhich was to do a groovy back end isanyone familiar withgroovy okay yeah yeah no one's clappingbecause it's not fun to be familiar withgroovy groovy is an adult shaped toddlerit is one of the worst languages of alltime anyone with kids understands whatthat means it's horrible and so Iactually had to do that I had to do itfor nine months to build this back endin groovy and of course I took theopport to just do it the best I knewnobody at the company I knew noconnections I didn't know groovy Ididn't know the tech stack I just wentin there and thought okay I could dothis I can actually figure this out andI can do a really good job and so Ijumped in there and lo and behold it wassuccessful we had like no productionoutages uh we invented what we calledthe slow clap at that point which meansI rolled it out only to 1% of thecustomers in 2014 instead of all of themcrowd strike did not learn from me 10years ago you think they would havethey did not um and my boss was reallylike happy about that cuz nobody wantedto work on the back end not a single UIengineer wanted it they all hated it sohe said hey could you just rewrite howwe do our data structure right now it'sthis way we've had this two-year bug wehave to rewrite it no one wants to do itand so I was like oh yeah yeah I'll dothat I'm I'm familiar with groovy now Ican do this so I rewrote that and itwent really really well so then theyasked me to help with falor so I diddata fetching for Netflix and got to goon open source talks and do all that andthat kept going really really well andthen eventually because of thoseconnections a man named guy Sereno saidhey why don't you do this extra lifeevent with me on Twitch so I did thatand then I really liked doing twitch sothen I kept streaming and I startedmaking YouTube videos and then Iaccidentally ended up right here talkingall this nonsense and I can attribute itall the way back to learning groovywhich is kind of a weird roundabout wayto make it up here at a PHP conferenceyou know it's like a very weird kind ofRoute uh I tell all of that that cuz Ihave to say it before I tell this storyin2007 uh I was just coming out of mywayward youth kind of Adventure if youwill uh for those that don't know anypart of my story um I had a teacher inhigh school handw write me a letter onnice thick printed paper nicely signedsaying she was I was the worst studentshe's had in 30 years like real winningkind of material at that point actuallyat the age of 18 my grandfather gave methe birthday present of informing me Iwas out of the the family will so youknow like I I've done some things youknow and I I I did recover and so 2007I'm coming back and I took pre-cal forthe first time ever I failed I took itagain I failed I took it a third timeand got a c c is not like that great Iknow C's earn degrees but it's reallynot like that impressive okay I'm noteven getting what is that less than fourout of five things right so it's it waspretty bad but I still got through itand I remember just going that summersaying I don't I'm not sure if this isdesperation or determination but I'mgoing to do calculus I'm going to figurethis kind of thing out so I went tosummer school and I spent two hours inclass after two hours in class I spenttwo hours at the math learning centerafter doing that I spent six to8 hoursdoing just atome studying problems overand over again and I did this for fiveweeks and in the first day at class Iwas convinced I was the worst studentright I have no track record of beinglikeachieving much and so after that sixweeks forward I was objectively by allstandards the best student and thatmoment in my life somehow changedsomething in me which was when somethingis super difficult say groovy a languageyou never worked on and a text act younever worked on being the youngestperson out of everybody on your teamlike when all the odds are against youand you're not like gal smart right Iwasn't solving anything as a kid Iwasn't like out there with the Geniusesthat if I just hadtime and determination I can achieveanything and so many people I meet Icannot tell you how many individualmessages including like a bunch of youwalked up and told me about the messagesyou've sent me where you have the samefeeling except for you don't have thathopeful end you don't know if you can uhbet on yourself I am telling yousoorry I don't know I just get sopassionate about this um really you canbet on yourself you can you canactually I I don't actually cry I workout I don't know what's happening rightnow um but you can actually bet onyourself you can take the chance and Iurge you take the chanceyou may not be betting on the samecircumstances you may not know what'sgoing to happen and I can't tell you ifllms are going to take your future ifthe job Market's going to improve ifthere is a much better job out there onthe horizon I can predict nothing ofyour future but I can say with certaintybetting that you can solve something youdo not know will pay not just dividendsthat year or the next year but fordecades and I also say that[Applause]and I and I say that because it's suchan important topic because I feel likewhatever reason I'm not sure if it wascovid or llms coming onto the scene orwhatever but I just feel this Generalkind of like malaise over people thatthings are just difficult and I don'tthink it has to be that way I mean by NEI mean by necessity we're all going todie we all have an ending things willget hard but I don't know if that'sright now and so I just have thisintense desire to see people succeedbut and this is a really importantthing is your desire for Success cannotcome at a cost and what I mean by thatis that during the first year of mymarriage and during the second year ofmy marriage it was the worst years of mymarriage I've been married now for 13years it's actually the best year of mymarriage right now so surprisingly Ireally really like it yeah we can clapfor that that's a goodone the thing was is that I came offthat high of being able to solvesomething being able to know that I canbuild stuff that even though I struggledfor two months to understand recursionand I thought I wasn't a very goodprogram I knew if I applied myself Icould figure it out I did figure it outI knew that I could do a startup so Iprogrammed it with PHP 5.2 by the waygood vintage it's a very good vintagereally enjoyed it public class modifiersand so I just was really into it and Iknew I could build it but the problemwas is I was doing it for like 80 90 100hours a week I was so con convinced thatI can accomplish any problem but I hadno ability to Value what was valuableand so the two-edge to this is thatalways bet on yourself but don't betagainst something that's good in valuedon't cut Corners it's not worth ittrust me an extra 10 hours has nevermade a startup succeed or fail ever andso that's kind of my two things I justwanted to say because if you want to bean excellent developer you have to bewilling to go the distance but you alsohave to be willing to know what isvaluable and they say that intelligenceis the ability to solve hard problemsbut wisdom is knowing which problems tosolve and so just know the problemsdon't be like me besmarter that's it that's all I had tosay thename is isn'tAaron just a National Treasure a jI tried to go real[Applause]fast now well done hey well done yeah umso great to have you here at a PHPconference um here's my question for youyou talked to you talked a little bitabout your fourkidsdon't uh we were both just like workingout backstage earlier it was C was crazythis guy can bench he can bench it'scrazy umwhat you're you're out you're gone fromNetflix you're doing so much whatcontinues to driveyouum there's I mean obviously there's likethe easy things to say that I havebeautiful wife kids like I have toprovide for them I made the guaranteedto my wife that if she helps with thekids during their younger years herability as she gets to work or dowhatever she wants for the remainder ofher life with no pressure at makingmoney like that's her goal and mine isthat I have to at all times be the likelast and final one and so that's justlike a very obvious thing uh and secondI enjoy these things it's very simple II really like building I likediscovering how things work there'ssomething just just magical about seeinga problem from a perspective you'venever seen before it just changes howyou kind of perceive all the programmingbut more so it's that it's the messagesit's the people going are llms going totake my job is it actually worth codingI'm 25 am I too old to learn to coderight like you hear that and I know it'slike stupid when you've already beencoding but if you haven't been codingand you've had such a rough go thatyou're starting to just even figure outyour life in your 20s or your 30s it'slike man that's just so good to be liketrust me it's always worth it to bet onyourself and to to the person or peoplethat are listening that say um I want toI want to do what you do Beyond bettingon themselves which I think is maybe theprimary First Step Beyond that what doyou say to the person that says I wantto I want to do what that guy does but Iamafraid so there's a lot of people thatget into making content or trying toproduce these things and try to putstuff out there and they get all theanalytics and they look at all thethings and they go oh well you know inthe first 15 seconds I wasn't preciselyor maybe it's the music it's all thisstuff and those yes they they they dohelp to analyze your metrics and do allthat stuff but what people would muchrather see is just you doing somethingyou really love if you can just do thatthe thing is is there may not be anaudience you might not be able to doanything with it but there also could bea huge number of people excited to seewhat you're doing and so I'd rather tryto do the things I want to do the way Iwant to do them than trying to figureout how to please just that one personand constantly like trying to striveafter what I think everybody else wantsbecause ultimately I'm going to getburnt out I'm going to get sad I'm goingto feel dejected when things don't workout I'm not going to be like oh dang itnobody likes me instead it's just likethis is what I like does anyone want tosee what I like we all do y'all give itup for the primagen",
    "summary": "The Primeagen's Laracon US 2024 talk centers on the core concept of \"Developer Excellence,\" arguing that it hinges on a willingness to bet on oneself, especially when facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. He recounts his early career at Netflix, where he was hired as a senior engineer despite lacking the experience, and was assigned the unenviable task of working on a Groovy backend. Instead of shying away, he embraced the difficulty, learned the language and tech stack, and delivered a successful project. This success, he argues, stemmed from a personal realization during his academic struggles where he transformed from a failing student to the best in his class through sheer determination and hard work. This taught him that with enough effort, he could overcome any obstacle, a principle he believes is essential for all developers.\n\nHowever, The Primeagen cautions against pursuing success at all costs, emphasizing the importance of balance and valuing what truly matters. He shares a personal anecdote about the early years of his marriage, where his relentless pursuit of startup success led to neglecting his relationship. He stresses that intelligence is solving hard problems, but wisdom is knowing which problems to solve. While he encourages developers to embrace challenges and push their limits, he also advises them to prioritize their well-being and relationships, recognizing that overwork and neglecting personal life are not paths to lasting fulfillment or excellence. His message resonates with developers feeling overwhelmed or uncertain, offering a blend of encouragement and practical advice for navigating the challenges of the tech industry."

taking riskcompanies don't want Theory anymore theywant execution can you build a productthat solves a problem for most of youany ESOP you get in any company whetherhere or outside just assume it's worthzero today you would rather intern atApple for zero than get paid 30k a monthat some Lalu Prasad company it will takeyou 20 years to make serious money ifyou work here or anywhereelse soI'll repeat why I'm doing this I thinkwe have rapidlyscaled uh last year this time we werelike six people or something like thatuh and now we're a lot of people and alot of you are fairly young this is yourfirst job this is your second job and Ithink this is not just true for you butit's also true for the people thatfollow me on Instagram or YouTube andgenerally youngsters today right whichis nobody has ever told youhow to work in aWorkforce cuz most of you graduatedduring the pandemic most ofyou have never worked professionally inyour job and when you get fired nobodyactually tells you why you're gettingfired they say misper performance orthis or that right so what is happeningand this is something I've noticed froma very zoomed out perspective thatyou're getting information from thewrong sources and you are taking whatother people are creating as content andthinking your life is supposed to belike that which is not not really howit's supposed to be so hopefully thissession teaches you two things one whatwe expect as employers and not just usbut I think General companies in Indiaright most startups most companies inIndia what we expect and number two howyou can actually progress in your careercuz careers today are very differentfrom careers a decade ago a decade agoor 20 years when my my mom let's say wasworking in banking it took her manyyears like 30 years of grinding samecompany maybe one company shift after 15years it's very different now you haveplenty of options you have like theworld has changed so hopefully this isuseful for you because I think ingeneral I've thought about how can thisbe how can this lead to success for youso it's called Rules of Engagement whichis what do companies expect from you andwhat you expect from what you shouldexpect from companies and yeah it's aguide to the to working in the modernIndian Workforce can we go to the nextslide please okay now serious companiesand that two kinds of companies okay youyou'll see see this now there are twokinds of companies where there's somecompanies who are serious who arescaling who pay employees real cashwhere they have real clients and youhave you provide a service or you builda product or something and there's abunch of unserious companies as well andmore and more unserious companies arepopping up we'll talk about this umserious companies only want to work withpeople who understand the roles ofEngagement it's like I don't know if youknow this but today let's say if youleave here and go work at anothercompanydo you know what the first thing theother company will do after youinterview anyone has anyguesses yeah so mum want to answer thatso what mdom said is they do a processcalled due diligence how many of youhave not heard of duediligence okay just so you know supposeyou leave here and you join anothercompany or forget about us right likesuppose you worked at Flipkart and youleft Flipkart and went to anothercompany the HR at the new company willcall your old companyand they will ask them how is thisperson did this person behave well likewas he useful right and we get lots ofsuch calls right people who join us andthen move on Etc and it's not just herebut in every other company so stuff likethat serious companies only want to workwith serious people so when they callthey mostly asking about seriousnessright does is this person worth hiringso we're going to cover four thingstoday the first one is the invasion ofthe modern employees brain I thinksomething happened after the pandemicsomething happened after in India uh themodern employees brain is is gone casehopefully we can correct some of thattoday and what is a founder and what isthe difference between a founder andemployee because today being a Founderis cool but it wasn't always so thirdone is organization structure andexpenses like if we are charging aclient let's say five lakhs or 10 lakhshow much money do we make out of it howmuch money do you make out of it how dowe calculate the expenses all of thatwe're going to reveal all of that coolstuff today and how you you can reallymakemoney okay so we're going to cover allfour of this how you can accelerate yourcareer how you can grow whether you wantto become a Founder tomorrow whether youwant to become a senior executive hereor at any other company we're going tocover all four of it nextslide this is a healthybrain and seenice pinkpink smooth brain okay let's see anunhealthy brain nowthis is a damagedbrainuh okay this might sound like a jokeespecially this last one here 10 jobs intwo years plus sixagencies but it's not actually a jokelike me Rohit ronit Lavina we sit inthat room sometimes hiring people I'msure you know AOS slabs is also hiring abunch of people uh and when we see thenumber one thing that most people say isyeah you know I did this then 3 monthslater I did this then 3 months later Idid this and then you know I've starteda company and then I'm I also run thiscompany and we've had so many of thesepeople now that it's like now becomelike a chronic pattern and it reminds meof when I was like 20 years old andconfused and I wish somebody just likepicked me up by the year whacked me onetime and said no this is not how you dothings here is the better way to readyour career so I think everyone has adamaged brain but it's not your faultyou know whose fault it is it's ourfault the people who makecontent right because and not usspecifically but content creators rightin general today Instagram is floodedwith content saying you know buy 25you'll be millionaire mindset driving aRolex or sorry a Lamborghini and likewear a Rolex and you know you'll beworking four hours a week or whatevernobody here who's made it I I I get towork with some really Fascinating Peoplehas have you seen any of them work 4hours a week no they're here like a longlike a lot of the time and they're hereSaturdays and Sundays as well so it'sreally different from what people thinkit is next slide so I'll tell you why noone tells you the truth on social mediayou would expect by now people to tellthe truth on social media to come outand be like what what it's actually liketo work at a company but there's a proI'll tell you the challenge challenge istoday social media is mostly youngpeople mostly people that 20s 21 22 23some something in that age range rightyoung people are mostly playing statusgames as an extension of college most ofyou went to college yeah and in collegeyou had statusgamespopular Branch you know you're justextending that most of these people arejust extending that in the social worldI see one tweet every day of somebodyelse you know saying oh you know thisperson got placed for this but why am Inot getting a job for this whateverright it's an extension of college andthe this is the most important thingright the third thing and it's somethingI suffered from when I was very veryyoung everyone here if especially if wehave hired you you are super highpotential and everyone sitting watchingthis kind of content especially onlineyou're super high potential but there'sa gap between potential and testedpotential and I wish I understood thiswhen I was younger I'll tell you whatthis means in your head you might thinkokay I can do this and this I'm the bestvideo editor I'm the best softwareengineer but being tested ishard like most people when they getfaced with this test and we'll talkabout the test later right in everyperson's career you have to go throughthis one test with tests not just canyou do the skill but can you provideoutcomes there's a very big gap betweenthe two and every year that passes I seethis gap for most people like wideningand lastly older people the reason noone tells you the truth is that olderpeople people in their 30s they have noincentive to go on social media and tellthe truth a because they don't wantcompetitors to come like do the samething that they're doing and B there arepeople like Naran morti who have triedto tell the truth that you have to workX number of hours or whatever it is andreally got cancelled for it nobody wantsto take the risk and I know lots offounder friends right they're all likedamn scared they're all like you know if I say this world people say ofme will they go cancel my app that stuffhappens that's a real fear in manyFounders heads so they just don't sayanything online so what happens thisfirst crowd the first two crowds rightpeople playing the status game the youngpeople playing the status games areflooding social media with all sorts ofthings that are not really true becauseyou only find out what works or not inyour career by the time you're 30 I'm 31today and I had to go through I had todo a lot of wrong things to theneventually do the right thing all rightnext slide this is a picture of Socratesyou know Socrates this a this ofprobably an artist rendition okay I'lltell you a very interesting story aboutSocrates I'm butchering thedetailsbut Socrateswas exiled and then eventually he wasasked to take like a cup of poison thisis Poison by the state do you knowwhy cuz Socrates told thetruth Socrates told his students I'mjust I'm making a very simplistic storyout of this he told his students goquestioneverything if there's somebody beingreligious go question them why why andyou know how young people are right theystarted questioningeverything they went to all the prieststhey started questioning them this thatso the state found him guilty and saidboss you're making everything unruly anduh you know just throw away everythingyou've said just say you know I waswrong about everything and we'll let yougo but if you don't if you stick to yourideals we're going to make you drinksome poison so stood for the truth hestuck to his ideals he ended up havingto drink poison the lesson from this isnot stick for stick for the truth anddrink poison or whatever the lesson tolearn from this is a lot of people areput in this especially people who aresuccessful are put in this positionwhere they can't go out publicly tellwhat made them successful or what therules of success are because firstly therules are not as like do 1 2 3 4 fiveit's a little bit complicated and it's alot of hard work stick around for 20years and it's not good content if Imade a video saying here's how you getsuccessful and I said it takes 20 yearsor 10 years all of you would click awaybe like n a trick faceless Channel whatis the trick today to be successful sonobody nobody says it because there's noincentive you'll just shout at them inthe comments anyway next slide so socialmedia therefore is Lies byOmission which means and this is Plato'sit's a it's a it's this allegory of thecave where there are someprisoners and you can seesome uh they can see someShadows but what they're seeing issomebody holding up like a cat orwhatever and they're seeing a cat hereso they think there's actually a catthere so you're not actually seeingreality for what it is you're seeingsocial media which is a mirror ofreality so reality is here it's a mirrorand it's coming back to you but realityis different it's messy and hopefullythrough this deck we are able to youknow tease out reality a bit so forexample the one person or the few peoplethat go out and actually say it takeshard work and energy and really lots offailure and lots of you know careers upsand downs when they go say these thingsnobody likes it and it becomes nationalnews nextslide okay now again I'm repeating thisfor the nth time but most this is whatmost youngsters think how many of youthink you'll be a millionaire by25 millionaire 8.4 crores okay we haveone person there yeah this might soundlike a joke but especially if you go totier 2 tier 3 India a lot of peoplereally believe that cuz you can see fromtheir feed no ultimately whatever is onyour feed you end up thinking that thatis true some of you especially Engineersright believe that you build somemagical X technology it's going to makeyou super rich and that can be reachedthrough pure skill maximization as ofthe MD of Google in of YouTube uh a weekago or something like that we were atGoogle marketing live and interestinginteresting thing he said is Google is aproduct company but in India we have somany people it's like a services companybut everyone still especially Engineershave that myth that you build atechnology and you do something and thenlike that Social Network movie that youget rich some of you on the other sidecreators think you create content everyday it's going to make you rich um Ithink ronet told me this very funnything he told me which is the minute Isee one of our employees creatingcontent I'm like has he leftso everyone thinks that creating I meaneveryone does like so many people havedone this right we are a very very youngcompany we just started but like peoplewill leave us sometimes and then verynext week there's like they start doingcontent right and they do it exactly for2 weeks and then they give up becauseobviously as you know in two weeksnothing happens so people think creatingcontent is going to make you rich andfamous some of you who want to beentrepreneurs think funding is easilyavailable you know this is very specificto the online audience More Than Thisaudience but this idea that you can justgo to an investor and it'll give youlike 1 CR 5 crores 10crores it just doesn't work that wayespecially now it just doesn't work thatway it's actually really hard to raisefunding and uh it's very rare for you tobe able to raise funding in this climatewithout having like history of buildingsomething reasonablysuccessful next thing is you can havethe ideal life without trade-offs orsacrifices actuallythe people who work 4 hours a week andare rich the people I know let's sayhave actually spent a decadeworking 10 hours aday it's like it's almost like you firsthave to do the hard work the extremehard work and then you can spend thetimechilling I'veactually I mean there are examples ofpeople working 8 hours a day and doingreasonably well but it's very hard tostart your career saying I'll work 4hours a day for the next 30 Years butget rich it's very very difficult to dothatthe last problem which is the system isbroken I was like this when I was youngit's like government sucks these guyssuck politicians don't know anythingnobody knows anything my teachers areidiots system is completely broken I canfix it I think my ideas are better butwhat I didn't realize when I was 20 andbetween 20 and 30 is the gap betweenideas and execution is huge it's massiveand we'll go through why it's hard andlastly there's Elon Musk itis the mostpopular influencer in the world is notMr Beast in my opinion it's Elon Musk hehas the he has like hundreds of millionsoffollowers and Elon Musk has convincedeverybody that you can start fivecompanies at one time and do reallyreally well and make a ton of moneyand be really popular on social mediaand he's done like deep tech companiesright so it's not easy and if you lookat Elon musk's like career graph hestarted very very early and his firstsuccess was actuallyX right the PayPal what they did withPayPal so he's had time to become ElonMusk it's very hard to be an Elon Muskat 20 or22 okay next slide so I want to tell youwhat reality is really like some storiesof successful companies how long itactuallytakes this 2008 this is I'm sure thispicture is not from 2008 but I couldn'tfind an old picture of zato this is aold uh article about flip cart uhFlipkart opens his first office inbangaluru pin code56034 they delivered 3,400 shipmentssuccessfully okay and there's somefactors that led to success todayFlipkart is massive sorry uh zomato ismassive so is Flipkart flipcart IPObillions of dollars zomato billions ofdollars and it's look at the gap 2008and 2024 you're hearing about zomatoFlipkart now it's been popular in thelast like 3 4 years it's really been inyourbusiness case studies are made of out ofit but look at the Gap what's the whatis 2024 minus2008 16years the guys who made money the guysand girls who made money at zomato andFlipkart in the early days have probablyworked there for a very longtime and they've been thereearly right they have thousands ofemployees now but I'm sure the first 100are treated like royalty but moreimportantly the factors that led tosuccess of zato Flipkart it's very hardfor you to replicate them today in thesame way the software methods andFrameworks if a zomato guy 10 years agolike I I remember there is one very uhinteresting article by Shopify about howthey shifted from a monolithic serviceto microservices have you guys heard ofthis thesis you heard of this right thatShopify that famous article where theyshifted from monolithics this thing tomicroservices and everyone said Ahthat's the way to do things right andthere's so many debates I'm sure surethere are debates even today of zomatouses this or Z or or Flipkart uses thisbut remember that's probably not whythey got successful they use it becauseit's a relic of the fact that it's socomplicated as a system now it's hardfor them to change next is the type ofmarketing you know there are manybusinesses that grew purely on adsactually that was a primary way to growin India or any other country you wouldrun ads you know how You' runads you put them in the newspaper socialmedia I mean Instagram faceb FacebookGoogle ads how old are thesecompanies what happened before that whathappened 100 years before that soadvertising as a medium has changed inmy opinion now ads are also dead liketoday if you see ranir Singh in anotherad you're like whatever you scrolllike right so advertising has alsochanged and in fact you guys know thed2c companies that we're now seeing thatare becoming very very successful arebecoming successful on the back ofinfluence of marketing right so they'rethe way they are growing the way theyare scaling has become completelydifferent now and I think in the lastone year we have been seeing this riseat least in India of like YouTube drivenbusinesses we've seen this in the US 3four years India is always laggingbehind us for a bit but we've seen thisin the US right Mr Beast you go to anystore in New York you go to any store inLa there is a damn Feast tables right onthe table Prime in every fridge sobuilding distribution first first freeadvertising you spend zero your cost ofacquisition is zero and then you build abusiness on top seems to be the way thatpeople are doing it now but if you goback a lot of people like sometimes youknow Saga and shans have to deal withthis all the time right where we workwith some Brands and they're like What'sthe treatment of thisvideo right where they're still thinkinglike 20 years ago where they're stillthinking like 30 years ago uh Marketopportunities changes andchallenges Market has also evolved a lotlike today you would find it verydifficultto makea d2c brand that does what let's say umI don't know like a nikar does cuz it'salready clogged it's already saturatedlike the reason we I think got sometraction is because AI became a newinflection point and we said okay we cancreate content around this it might beuseful but Mo many people with ideasoften say okay we'll do the same assomebody else but like 500 people doingthe same thing okay and lastly even thefounding DNAright the founding DNA that you neededback then was like a proper dhundha pnlguy like in India this is a known factright if there's some laa type guysitting there thinkingthrough that's like the way to succeed Istill believe you need some of that butI think the DNA of the founders now hasstarted to change more in terms of thisis my opinion whoever is able toadvertise and Market best get theirproduct in front of as many eyes aspossible wins this is why our clientsreally come to us right at Yas wherethey want us to do you for them it's forthe same reason because they're startingto realize actually Building Products isgetting easier over time buildingdistribution is getting harder it's it'ssomething that people have startedrealizing over time hardik Panda fromnot from the Indian cricket team butfrom um uh unacademy has a great threadon this I'll read it out for you becauseI think the screen size is small I'veinteracted a bit with the genziworkforce in the last few months youwould see a consistent pattern aroundtheir casual disregard for hard worklongevity of a career and the trade-offsinvolved the their argument and I I knowmany of you are argument and many peopleonline as well is that work hasevolved it has but here's what hasn'tjenzi speaks fondly about setting theirown terms for timecommitment not making as many sacrificesdefining their own benchmarks of successI'll create my own agency how many ofyou think you'll create your own agencyor business at some point honest truthfromeveryone everyone else come onI know I've spoken to some of you whowanted to start your own agency orcompany at some point there's a lot ofhands right so I'll create my own agencyI'll freelance from Goa how many peopleever thought at least once I'llfreelance from Goa just look at thenumber of hands in the room how many ofyou have thought I'll build my ownYouTubechannel okay that's literally every handin the room I want to build a communityand Mentorpeople right lot of hands problem iswhen proded enough you learn that theirwillingness usually stems from the prideof having figured out a marketArbitrage okay you know what a marketArbitrage is it means you've learnedsomething that nobody elseknows that's what an Arbitrage isbasically you're you're saying I havesome information that nobody else doesI'm going to take advantage of thisinformation and as if they landed onthis asymmetric advantage that wasn'tafforded to the folks before them theproblem about market arbitrages and he'svery right about this because just soyou know I wrote a book in 2018 calledpajama profit where we literally coveredlots of thisit's called pajama profit it's aboutliterally sitting and freelancingobviously we didn't talk about companiesas much but we spoke a lot aboutfreelancing we also spoke about buildinga personal brand there's a chapter inthe book2018 6 seven years ago right the problemwith Market Arbitrage is they spreadlike wildfire and in no time everyoneknows about them now you all know thetechniques of how to build a Channel orhow to go freelance or whatever right toexploit an Arbitrage you still need tobe in the top 1% of what you do so notonly do you need to find an advantageyou also need to be in the top 1% ofthat Advantage it's really hard and thelast thing is no Arbitrage is enough tosustain a 25y old career let's say youbuild an agency on something new how yougoing to sustain it 25years right so these things are notunique to you like sometimes some peoplewake up and they're like oh you know Ihave this unique idea I'll build thisagency or I'll do this YouTube or I'llfreelance from goout this is now the most common thoughton social media especially in India youneed to find find something new nextslide so the problem is you are not onlygetting wrong information you're alsogetting delayed information like I saidfrom the zato story your takeaways fromwhat framework they use what stack theyuse how they did things are so old thatyou're making life decisions on whatworked one or two decades ago there aresome people who making life decisionsbased on what worked even before thatlike all the guys going to entranceexams right now nothing against them ifyou're in the top 1% you'll win but ifyou're not in the top 1% your life isgoing to be hell there's a reasontoday's Founders for example arebuilding on top of YouTube and WhatsAppwe're not stupid we know how to buildproducts we built scenes a couple ofyears ago right where we built out theentire expans by ourselves but welearned a very important lesson which isthat building on top of YouTube andWhatsApp are much more valuable becauseyou're taking advantage of theirinherent distribution and your costs arelower right like you want to do videostreaming by yourself tesis will tellyou all the bills if you want to buildvideo streaming by yourself this is formore for the engineers but the last gendid things differentlybut you have to keep evolving with thetimes right and the algorithm onlysurfaces successes and flashyLifestyles your algorithm will not showyou some struggler it will show you beerbiceps and then Dru rati and then thenext success and the next success andthen ktic Arian McLaren car whatever thealgorithm is built for that and it'sgiving your brain like like cancer orsomething so and there's also massiveamounts of surviv ship bias right rightthe people that did the exact samethings but failed you can take what I'vedone in the last like 6 months 8 monthsor you can take let's say what roit hasdone and you can find five other guyswho've done exactly the same thing withthe exact same steps but because theymissed one or two things they weren'table to make it you know how many clonesthere are of some of the businesses wehave here the minute we make somethingwork we'll see one clone and youknow it's it's so strange right likethere's nothing against the Clone it'sjust they're doing exactly the samething but there are some factors ortiming that made our thing work at thetime that it worked so I feel like and Iwe're still not a big company we'restill a very tiny company right but Idon't think copying another businesswould work so easily and a change inwhat is school so what is what wasschool 10 years ago entrepreneurship wasnot cool 10 years ago Suddenly It'sbecome cool so you're also tracking whatis on TV and what is on social mediatoday next slide this is a picture of mefrom2015 it's almost 9 10 years ago that isme in Delhi with three other co-foundersrunning a company called job Spire thisis a makeshift microwave I mean this isa microwave but it's a makeshiftstanding table I had a back cake backthen and enjoyed my back or somethingit's my MacBook and this is like areally old building in Delhi I startedthere I'll tell you one thing in 2015 itwas uncool to to run your own company inIndia you looked at as unemployed myparents didn't know how to explain whatI did to their friends and everybodyelse and startups there was some hypearound startups but it was still seen asa an uncool thing to do okay and then wehad social network pictures SiliconValley media started talking aboutit funding suddenly it becamecoolright nextslide and that's why in my head and Iknow this is true for some of ourleadership as well there are two kindsof Founders okay like I told you there'sone kind of like this is that's SharBambu I have crazy amount of respect forhim he has hundreds and zo is a clientas you all know hundreds of thousands ofemployees he's working full-time he hasa real board real consequences I don'tknow if he has a board but there arereal consequences he's actually mademoney he looks at everything intradeoffs right money time Peace of Mindmuch less concerned about status becausehe already has the serious peoplealready know who he is and veryrespected in thecommunity right now I'm making someassumptions but I'm saying that ingeneral this kind of founder theseFounders I look up to as well right nowthere's another kind of founder whichI've been seeing a lot of lately andthere's nothing wrong with this but thisis this isgenerally what social media encourageswhere you're founder for the status youjust want to you know be cool and you'redoing a lot of things at once andthere's nothing wrong with doing a lotlot of things is runs but one thing hasto work one thing has to generate cashfor you to be able to take multiple betsyou can't do too many things and that'sthe Nuance right you can't do fourthings together unless one thing isabsolutely crushing it and we are a goodexample of this by theway yet to breach any reasonable Revenuehas no employees therefore no real costokay very young therefore lower risk doyou know the risk of a Founder who is 30years old who has twokids or let's say 35 years old two kidsparents to take care of threeemployees versus a 20-year-old who'slike I started a agency today do youknow what the risk profile differencebetween these two is massive Gap youcan't even call them the same type ofthe the odds for the the stakes for boththese kinds of Founders are sodifferent that's why when somebody's 35and they start a company I take themseriously I'm like oh big deal foryou and I think Main thing is and thisis the thing that really confuses usmany of these guys are looking for jobsit's like wait aren't you like a Founderlike run your company why why youlooking for a job unless you've shutdown your company then then it's finethen it makes sense but yeah it's justconfusing and they yet to earn therespect of existing Founders but that'sokay that's atechnicality all respect can beearned like it might take you half adecade 5 years 10 years 15 years but youcan earn other people's respect so thisis just a temporary pit Stu stop nextslide please the reality is thatentrepreneurship is reallyhard uh it takes 10 plus years to makereal money 2015 is when I started Ithink I still haven't made like crazymoney it takes a long time to make realmoney most people willfail 90% of people will fail the oneswho succeed make very little money worsethan a job there not a false stat justbecause you hear of the same 50companies in the news half of which aregoing to dive they're unicorns but theydon't have real profit so they might diethere's so manyFounderswho it looks like a success but they'venot made realmoney it's worse than a job honestly andthey' just wasted their time it's notreal risk if you're hedging with a jobgood Founders will not take youseriously and like I said family and ageshoot up the risk and the thing aboutbeing a Founder is you have some goodmonths and you make zero on the othermonthseveryone there at least knows this rightsome good months but you make zero onother months and you'll often haveradical pivots you look foolish fordecades earlier I used to look atsomebody like let's say a G mjal rightand I look at them pivoting I like ahwhy they pivoting but now I get it I'mlike yo what you're trying to seek isnot the validation of other peopleyou're trying to seek something that youcan build that works that people pay forand sometimes you will get it wrong sosometimes I will come to you and be likesorry this was not the way to do itlet's do it this way it's not becauseI'm dumb or scatterbrained or whateverit's because I'm looking for somethingthat the market will pay for cuz I'velearned the hard way that if you buildsomething just based on your convictionand you don't make money out of iteveryone Burns Out you will all run outof motivation you'll leave two yearslater or 6 months later whatever it isso you have to look for pmf andsometimes you look foolish for a longtime doingthat your friends would make more moneythanyou this is kind of obvious anyone witha job stable job especially your companydoing well will make more money than youand this is more for the engineers butcourage and staying power are far moreimportant than intelligence Twitter nowis like filled with like oh if you'renot like 190 IQ and this and that you'renot going to make it that's not truelike go talk to any real estate guy oranyone any broker or something they'remaking far more money than many of theseengineers and they're not really overreliant on intelligence they're actuallyreliant on Courage relationships andstaying power and like I said the arenawill knock humility into you if you're aFounder for 10 years I've never met aFounder who's been around for 10 yearsandcocky never seen never seen thatespecially if they bootstrap right likebut the ego and arrogance of a Founderwho just raised 5 million oh my God it'snext level but the minute you've been inthis game for 10 years whether you'veraised money or not you're like anythingcan take me outanytime right so it will knock humilityinto you and and that's why I lovespending time with Founders who've beenaround for like a decade longer thanthat because they just know so much andthey're also sohumble it's the opposite of you knowwhat you get to see at least on socialmedia next slideplease okay so now let's get into yourparts of the equation has anyonewondered why you don't have EquityEquity no nobody else knows what Equityis I see bat I seeVishal okay I see mdom I see a bunch ofother people okay so I'll tell you thedifference between why Founders getequity and how Equity works as Founderscuz I've had weird conversations withthis over the year because this is justnot taught in college this is not taughtthis topic is not taught in college soyou have no idea especially because likestartups happen slightly later than whenCollege curriculums sort of froze inIndia people think you get equity fordoing work you actually don't get equityfor doing work you get equity for takingrisk this is a veryimportant concept to drive home okaythis has nothing to do withfoundershieldprofit and we are only like whatever 6 8months oldright most companies are bootstrappedand funding is an anomaly I did someresearch on the math I don't know howaccurate this is this is from whatever Ifound on Google there are 1.66 millionactive companies in India barely any areFfunded so this entire like Equity youhave a percentage of the company andthen you know when the company IPOs youmake crazy moneythat barely happens in India actuallyinvestors get Equity this is investorsnot Founders who just put in cash getequity for taking Capital risk not fordoing work okay and a lot of people getpissed off sometimes like especiallywhen I was younger and I didn't knowwhat Equity really stood for and I wasnegotiating equ with other people thething that whenever the conversationbroke up let's say I want to start acompany let's say selling candles and Iwas talking to another guy and he wanted50% I said no I don't think you're worth50% I'm worth 70% whatever it iswhatever the number isand the guy says no I will go start myown thing if an equity conversationbreaks down between Founders they moveon one of the founders moves on andeither he starts the same business ordifferent business or go gets gets a jobor whatever but the math is simple 100%of zero iszero so a lot of people really optimizefor ownership without realizing actuallyand I'm a good example of thisespecially now right where I'm notoptimizing for ownership in any companyI just want to own enough but I wantother people to be heavily incentivizedas well because I realize that 100% of 0Z what's the point of owning everythingbut not you know making profit nothaving other peoplecontribute now here's the part that is alittle bit hard to digest for mostemployees but y combinator will Echothis most other companies most thisswill Echo this right if you are paid amarket rate salary the amount of equityyou take home iszero it's a controversial point but it'sa true Point Equity is a measure of riskokay let's say you could either get ajob at TCS or some other com companywhatever some let's say the some of youmight be working at some other agency orwhatever right and let's say you knowyou were paid 3 lakhs anim plus one lakhstock I'm just giving some randomnumbers so let's say four lakhs anim youwere getting okay now the question toask is is that market rate for you wouldthe market pay you more okay I'll giveyou an example of somebody taking riskthere's a guy that I really want to hirehe's superb guy but very expensive rightit might run into 40 50 lakhs which Ican't afford at this point in our careerconsidering a bootstrap right so I'mlike yo take a 90% salary cut and comework with us but I'll give you Equityhow much Equity well we'll value thething and we'll figure it out nowwhether he'll say yes or no I don't knowbut that's a big deal he's 35 years oldhe has two kids and y y he's he alreadyhas a job an active job with very hespent n number of years with them sogenerally we don't give Equity to peoplewho are paid market rate or very closeto market rate okay but we are trying tochange that right in the sense that westill like let's still incentivize youto play the long game withus right in some cases not in all casesin some of our companies so employeeswith market rate salaries are stillgiven some amount of equity to alignmotivation right just so you're stillmotivated to do the thing now in the waywe are structured some of our companiesEquity is actually valuable some of ourcompanies Equity is completely uselessespecially in ag gencies my opinion isequity is not very useful unless youknow you decide to IPO tomorrow like aTCS or a vipro or something like that wehave no plans of IPO in N9 out of 10times though Equity is worthzero so the guy who's coming in fromGoogle or whatever company right let'ssay whoever I convinced to come at one/Tenth of the salary and come do a verybig role here nine out of 10 times he'llprobably make zero out of that it'lljust be pure risk for him it wouldbasically be like he's thrown his moneyinto the and whatever he currently hasinto the fireplace that's his risk totake that's why I no longer Hard Sell onthis I'm like yo it's your choice here'sthe risk you want to come come here'swhat you're giving up and nine out of 10times they say no to me which is finebut they need to be very clear aboutwhat the risks are before coming inaligning motivations of several peopleeven with money is damn hard in fact ifI would argue what the Crux ofEntrepreneurship is this it's two thingsright one is finding a market Gap andnumber two is getting the first 10people to come work with you for lowerprice and incentivizing them in whateverway possible is the hardest part becauseI'll tell you one thing when you startyou have nothing you start from A500 squfoot house we had nothing anyone takinga risk on us back then wasfoolish but again it's very hard withmoney but there it's easier to do withsomething like an equity or a profitshare be like I don't know where it'sgoing to work out but at least you havea chunk of it at least you try it hardat least we tried hard we gave it a shotnextslide okay the next question that mostof you have is why does the company getpaid so much more thanme have you ever thought of this howmany of you thought ofthis hands up come on want to see morehands a lot of people online havethought about this this is a subarcalled developers Indiawhere the this thing says just got tosee today how much my boss charges theclient I'm working at a services companyand I'm the old developer in one of theprojects I'm working on I'm paid well socan't really complain my boss doesn't doanything besides just talking to theclient and understanding requirementsbut yesterday I got to see how much hecharges the clients and blew my mindit's more than five times I'm getting soI wrote to the client if he wants tohire me directly but he forwarded theemail to my boss and I got questions whyI didthat don't clients know how much it costto hire their own developers if I wereto do freelance work how can I getclients like this this has 620 likes bythe way which is pretty good engagementfor developers India are for a RedditCommunity is pretty good engagementfirst comment honestly I'm stillsurprised your boss hasn't fired you thepremium they pay is for the trustassociated with the company pastexperience and so on I'll tell you whatI think I think this Gap comes from notknowing how much it costs to run acompany that's the thing right like whenyou've been a Founder for a while thenyou kind of get this thing of the costevery week when we discuss pnl with theteam it's almost like we paid forthat also when did this expensecome up now we have to pay depositoh the last house that we vacateddeposit only half came back cuz theowner scammed us all of that like it'sjust every week it's like it's like Isit with the teams and I'm likeuh I'm like where did the moneygo but it's important to understand thisbecause we'll break down the math nextslide okay so I just want to brieflyexplain why do I get paid X when companymakes y first thing is businessrelationship shs are built on Discoveryokay first you the client has todiscover you let's say you running anagency let's say you were running anagency all of you started an agencytomorrowcalled YouTube ABCDagency okay there are four things youhave to do first you have to getDiscovery you need to get a client toknow who you are to be attracted to youokay then you need to convert them justbeing attracted is not good enough justbringing someone into that room is notgood enough they have to convert you doa sale okay then you have to do firsttime proof of delivery you to do onevideo like as a video agency we do onevideo as the um as AOS slabs we have todo one you know AI campaign forthem and then there's continued trust ifyou've done one good one with them thenthey're like okay let's do it againlet's do it again let's do it again I'mgoing to break this down because this iswe are talking about businesses hereDiscovery ismarketing how do you get a client to beattracted to you is marketing now thereare many ways to do marketing butwhatever it's marketing conversion issales it's what gurmit does right it'slike somebody's already coming there's alead but GM's got to go close thatlead then there is first time proof ofdelivery which is almost alwaysdiscounting we probably lose money onthe first thing we do for any clientthere are some rare exceptions butusually we lose money on the firstdelivery for any client okay continuedtrust which is relationship maintenancequality of service meeting them once ina while making sure that you know ifsomebody leaves we replace that personis a continued headache okay nowremember four rules Discovery iscompetitive versus other serviceproviders we are not the only company inIndia that does AI campaigns we are notthe only company in India that does AIBusiness Solutions we're not the onlycompany in India that does uh videoediting or uh YouTube as a service sodiscover is competitive versus otherservice providers sales and conversionof areunreliable just because gurmit has 5,000leads it doesn't mean he will get 5,000conversions right it's unreliablesometimes it works out sometimes itdoesn't and even gurmit can't walk intoa sales meeting knowing will this guyconvert or not it's very challengingdiscounting loses the company money thefirst time I do anything for a client weprobably lose money it's we know we'relosing money but it's okay we're likewe're hoping that we do such a good jobthat the client does a second thing withus a third thing with us whatever it isTrust erods on the tiniest of thingsokay I'll give you an example theexample was of kosek okay Kosik is youngbut Kosik is not a very goodcommunicator he's very very good at whathe does but not a very good communicatorand when Kosik spends less timecommunicating with the client even if wedoing work it erods the client'strust and you might think but that's sosilly I I'm doing a good job yeah butthe client's not seeing it from theclient's perspective it's like theseguysthey told me 2 weeks ago this is goingto be done but 2 weeks later I haven'teven heard from them right and then thenext day if you send them the finalfootage they're actually surprisedthey're like wait you actually worked onthis right so trust erods on the tiniestof things so there's this overheadcommunication overhead of how can wekeep you know telling the client everyday every week what we're up to andkeeping them a breast right and ifthings are not working out telling themthings are not working or you shouldn'tbe doing this or you should cut yourlosses next slide so I'll tell you howthe internet and most of you do the mathfor for a 10 lakh deal let's say we'regetting a 10 lakh deal okay one let'ssay per quarter we're getting a 10 lakhdeal first GST will go Modi sir willcome remove 18% you know 8.2 lakhs fineokay now the way we let's say we do themath and these are not our numbers butI'm just saying let's say a sales getspaid 30 30k a month okay let's say aproject manager gets paid 60k a monthokay let's say an engineer gets paid 50ka month let's say it's an engineeringproject let's say we're doing somethinglet's say one of our clients let's saydwat okay let's say roughly this is themath I'm I'm taking average math now youdo quarterly so quarterly that sales repis being paid 1.2 lakhs project managersbeing paid 2.5 lakhs Engineers beingpaid 2 lakhs so total is 5.6 lakhscorrect what's the profit 8.2 minus 5.6what's the profit okay whatever theprofit is next slide okay the real mathwhich most smart people will think for a10 lakh deal it's still fake math butI'll tell you why so you have sales repproject manager engineer then you havean internet fee we spend like Martinwhat's our internet fee what isit yeah we spend 7 and a half lakhs ayear on internet just internet for theoffice okay so let's say whatever I'mbreaking it down I'm just saying 10K amonth or a quarter it's 40K electricitybill our electricity bill is huge butwhatever there's an electricity billthen there's office rent we forgot inthe last mon month that there's officerent so there's office rent on this thenthere's a marketing cost remember wesaid Discovery is a cost how do you getvisible in front of another client inour case let's say if it's hosting adinner hosting a conference whatever itis whatever the way you acquire ads soyou can do this math whatever this mathcomes up to okay and still looks likeit's profitable but I'll tell you thisis still fake math I'll tell you whatthe real math is like the math that Isee and China sees and Hara sees andwhatnot next slide I've addedsome I've added some descriptionsthrough chat GPD because I didn't wantto write it down but I'll tell you whatall it is there's legal fees youincorporate a company there's some costthat's a onetime cost but fine it'sthere's still ongoing cost in some somecases right contracts with clients everycontract we do the client is reviewed bya legal team it's not here the team isnot here but we have a client we we havea legal team then there's licenses andpermits in some cases our business maybenot but we you need specific licenses tosell stuff then there's office rentthere's security deposit there'sutilities okay then there's furnitureand Equipment you think the are freethey're not free these are expensive sothere's desks chairs computers printerssoftware licenses there's every day I Iwake up see the pnl it be an adobe billon the pnl I'm like righttelecommunication systems Etc thenthere's recruitment cost do you knowthere's a cost to hiring aperson especially people who are wastingwho come in and don't end up gettinghired sometimes we work with agencies tohelp us hire people right so there'sentire recruitment cost here thenthere's advertising online ads printmedia promotional materials and we dospend such a news spend on ads rightwhere suchin yeah you spend on ads sothere's advertising cost then there'swebsite cost obviously we don't we we'rea video company we don't give two shitsabout websites anymore then there'snetworking which is if you want to getto an industry Association you want togo to a conference you need membershipto go into some of those and some ofthose conferen are very useful Hara willtell you the cost of flying to thatconference and probably getting deal andcoming back is worth it right so there'ssome networking costs then utilitieswe've already spoken about theninsurance right all our companies havesome form of insurance or the otherright then there is maintenance whichis somebody cleaning this on an everydaybasis somebody walks in cleans thiswalks out right and I'm just going tokeep going through this right becausethese are all real expenses there'saccounting and bookkeeping sushmitawheresusm yeah susmita is there she she bookshe does bookkeeping for us then there'soffice supplies postage travel expenseswhatever then there's bloody AWS inCloud flare that that walk in the roomright AWS should be like I want thismuchgpus and every every week we have thatdiscussion should we buy the gpus orshould we you know use an AWS buteventually it always comes down to AWSbecause of ease of convenience it's justeasy to use an AWS spin up something oruse a replicate or something like thatright then there's software I'm sure youguys use some software or the other Iwas seeing tesis look at the linearwebsite I was like please not one moresubscription by the way you you guysspend like 50k a month onZoom do you knowthat spent 50k a month on Zoom thenthere's we don't have data securityright now uh because we don't you knowhave any client data uh then there's anemergency fund and I think that's themost important thing right remember wedid quartly math and the reason we didquartly math is you need to make sureyou have enough money in the bankbecause if you have a bad quarter youneed to be able to use that previousmonth to be able to pay for this monthbecause for you and this is slightlydifferent in the US with many jobs butfor you it's like this this thing of Iget a salary every month for me and thecore team here it's always like okay weneed to make sure across the year we areable to pay this person this much rightit's almost like ours is more one shotedand we absorb the risk to to give you achronic consistent salary it's mucheasier for funded companies to do muchharder for bootstrap companies like oursto do then there's expansion costsometimes you're planning for growth youwant to hire more people and every daysomeone or the other comes here and saysoh I want to hire this one more personbecause my back is aching I can't dothis whatever it is right so that's acost right then there's tax corporatetax comes in uh then there's whateverProfessional Services if we needadvisors if we're not sure aboutsomething and we need somebody else's adadvice okay there's also an employeethat doesn't work out cost one of thebiggest costs if I hire somebody let'ssay 5 laks anim and you don't work outfor the company and you've been therefor 6 months because now we're startingto scale and we don't have time to siton top of everybody's head it's just awaste ofmoney it's almost like somebody else isdoing one deal just to keep your salaryalive then there's income taxrate 30% in India there's also a searchcharge of 7% % of your income rangesfrom 1 CR to 10 crores so yeah basicallymy point is you should run a companyonce it's not that's why I said rightserious founder that that's where Istarted from because the minute you're aserious founder it's like you're goingthrough this one every week and then youknow every day somebody will come to youand be like compan is doing wellwhatever it is right next slide okayafter all this the founders get paidbeing a bootstrap founder is the mostinconvenient way to make money and Idon't know why you guys want to startagencies the minute it works it willburn you out that being said I'm aFounder so I love people who want to beentrepreneurs and do it themselves butalso prepare for 10 years of pain ifyou're not prepared for 10 years of paindon't do it you can still have like youcan still work from 20 to 25 make goodmoney have fun make the network Etc andthen start a company you know my biggestregret at 20 when I started job Spire Iwas like the problem is I don't knowanybody in the ecosystemtoday a lot of our success whatever saidand done is because I know people in theecosystem I'm able to just call uppeople and be like hey can we do XYZ foryou can we do YouTube for you or can wedo AI business solutions foryou but I didn't have that at 20 and I Ifeel like if I done a job till like 2425 it would have been much morebeneficial for me but then I would haveprobably been successful at 35 5 yearslater and I I still don't feel I'msuccessful I still feel there's anotherfive years left so maybe I'd make moneyat 40 right so just saying every thisit's this is the worst way to make moneynext slide so again the problem is manyyoungsters have not tried this seriouslyfull-time for sustained periods oftime okay fundraising has convinced acohort of Founders that thesemiscellaneous expenses should not bekept in mind while determine uniteconomics they're like bottlemanufacturing I'm selling it for70 okay and all of us do this likeespecially the people who do businesscase studies I get damn angry with themcuz they're like they only take the costof the item the manufacturing the itemand how much the margin is I'm like broyou're running a business no in themiddle of this you're runningacquisition all of that in the middle ofthis no how why are you why are you justtaking the cost of how much it cost tomanufacture like people keep making thisclaim with apple oh Apple manufacturestheir phone at whatever price margin butthey run a business huge business it'sthe best advertising business in theworld you don't think that costmoney Engineers today can build mlmodels this is especially true forTwitter where many Engineers will belike yeah you know I can build thismodel I can do this but cannotunderstand Excel okay and this isespecially true for our experiments teamright Shashank andVishal continuallydumping no offense to you guys I'm justsaying in general any experiments teamwe have we we would ever have rightcontinually dumping non-profitable riskon the company for personal explorationwhich is status need this is not atrivial problem I'll tell you why uhthere was a Labs there was a kid I'm notgoing to take his name but he reallywanted to do research at the company andwhile I really respect that okay here'smy thesis around it why do you want todo theresearch okay and if you really PR deepenough they want to do the researchbecause they want to post post a tweetabout it they're like see I I built thisI made this whatever it is have statusamong their peers butreally research like especially if youstart with researchit doesn't make any profit for us yoursalary is basically just a cost andyou're getting brownie points off of ityou're putting up an open source GitHubrepository that you know I I saw one guydo it for another company where hedidn't even mention the company's nameand he didn't on the company's salarylike what is wrong with youguys right so it's for your own statusneed and the way we do research is verynice at Labs where we like first we'llwe'll use third party models if itreally works you know then we'll see canwe can we make a better model out ofthis can we fine tune it for our needscuz we are a bootstrap company we arestill in the philosophy that first let'smake cash after we make cash you'll haveexcess then you can now we have aexperiments team but I'm very this thingthat experiments team has to be twopeople and not 50people right but there are some startupsthat do this completely inverted by theway where they're like okay first we'lldo research and experiment so manypeople who have been funded so manypeople who are building uh locallanguagellms I'm like where is the business it'sbetter to do a business use case for itsell chat GPT Plus+ do F tune one ofthose existing models prove that there'smoney in the market for this then buildthe model but no everyone's like doingit the other way around next slide andthis is true for the people who want towork on the hardest problems this istrue for filmmakers who how many of youare filmmakers in the companies in thecompany who want to like make filmstheyan like he put his hand up and thenhe put his hand on he's like I know I'mgoing to getokay I'll tell you the problem this truefor filmmakers and like really reallydeep tech people right you have tochoose between not getting paid fordecades starting your own company or youknow taking a huge risk and you knowdoing it at a company where you're notreally getting paid cash up front oryou're getting Equity instead or go workat Google in the filmmaker case go workat Hollywood or Bollywood or somethingokay if you can getin early stage startups who haven'traised too much money and this is morefor the startup and angle should becareful of absorbing expensive Talentwithout cash inflow from customers orexceptional fundraising ability somepeople are able to fundraise like I lookat them and I'm like wow the companydoesn't even do anything and you'veraised like 50 million wow I don't knowhow they do it and that's my lack rightlike I just maybe I don't know theinternal workings of this system butstill unless you have exceptionalfundraising ability you should avoidabsorbing expensive talent that wants todo things for personal exploration likefilm Mak we are in the game ofefficiency can we do it in a studio inas short a period of time as possiblecan we use existing models and build usecases that customers pay for muchsimpler problem statement right it'swise to solve problems first that don'trequire too much upfront investment andthere are enough and more problems inthis country to be solved without youhaving to go invest 20 crores into thebusiness till now we've never done thatinvest crazy amount of money or anythingwe're not a real estatecompany NeXT slide so this is not justtrue for you in this room but it's alsotrue for everybody watching this onlinewhich is now everything will beperformance-driven 2001 we had this timewhere everyone could come people haveworked in unprofitable companies forfive six years of their lives they'venever seen they've never worked at acompany making profit your marketing hasto now Drive conversions if you're amarketing person now it has to driveconversions your content now has to getviews and engagement time pass you can'tdo content saying I want to do thiseveryone comes to us and says now I wantto start this kind of Channel like youget us views in engagement then we'lltalk about it right after that we'llwe'll take the risk but till then you'reon your own your code has to make moneycan't be code for the sake of code rightso I there's this temptation with mostEngineers to build the next build aframework or and this happened in Googlewhere they incentivized people to go doexperimental projects and people justdid that for promotions just buildexperimental projects that made no moneyyour salary has to make sense in thep&l so some ofyou I won't say you guys because we havebeen pretty careful about this but whenpeople come in they're like some crazysalary expectation that they've heard onInstagram that and that's the problemwith marketing one guy will make a postsaying oh you knowtoday this role let's say um let's saytypist is now making three lakhs a monthor whatever or 30 lakhs an here's howyou can make that's everyone's hookrightthat'shook here's how this guy is making 75lakhs anddoingthis this Baki it's not his fault it'sthe game that's the problem with socialmedia so 20 21 free hits are over okayuh Theory and a lot of you are veryTheory this thing right like I know manypeople both on the content side as wellas on this side I know how to do thiscrazy effectvideo or someone on the engineering sidewho will be like yeah you know we shoulddo this theory is no longer sought aftercompanies don't want Theory anymore theywant execution can you build a productthat solves a problem or can you give aservice that solves a problem it's sosimple it's so easy but yet we go backand we like maybe you know what we'relacking is Theory it's the entire Indianeducation system problem it's like a vaasystem you know what the W system likeit's the W fication of work I have to goI read cracking the uh coding interviewI go into the engineering you knowinterview and I have to answer thesequestion 10 questions right answer thatonce specific pair programming Challengeand then I'm in but that's not whatpeople want anymore people are like Idon't care you work here you give meoutput client is happy with your work oryou're building a product and you'redoing it fast enough great that's all Iwant so world is changing and the gapbetween potential what you think in yourhead that you are and success is provenperformance now you need to prove sainnow needs to prove that he's good at adshe can't justsay now he has to prove that he's goodat itright so I call this the test because tobe honest for many years I I had thisidea in my head that I have crazypotential when I was young but I gotbelted by the test and at some pointit's inevitable everyone has to gothrough the test in your career and Ican tell you in this company everyonewho's done well has been through thetest something where they were reallyput on the spot and they had to pull amiracle off for the client or whateverthey're building right and mostyoungsters have been far disconnected Edfrom commercial outcome of the businessan editor is completely disconnectedfrom the outcome of a Creator's earningsdo you know this do you know what thatmeans you don'tknow and same for engineers right anengineer at zomato doesn't know wellthis line of code that I shipped howmuch is it making or saving for zomatosame with an editor do youknow Video Edit how much does thatincrease the top line of the Creator'searning you have no idea but sales guyson the other handthey damn wellknow right a sales guy knows I havecontributed this much to the company Ihave cost the company this much I'vecontributed thismuch right and sales is ultimately whatmakes the company moneyso I wish everyone was able to work insales for a few week of of their livesso they just got this this thing ofactually few months of their life sothey at least knew know how much itcosts to do what they do on a dailybasis and just be given the freedom todo creativestuff next slide so this is the testokay this is a I'm I'm I'm this is hyperbuly but nine out of 10 youngsters Imeet think they'll be the next Elon Muskroit was telling me this we're sittingin the room and we had some guy come inand he was like uh he said something andhe left and Ro was like Elon Musk likeme and Ro just have this thing we wepointed guy and we're like this guy islike Elon Musk right in their mind thatpotential is unlimited like me when Iwas young I was I'm also guilty of thisthis is not unique I started consumingcontent far before anyone else didbecause I got an internet connectionearly in my life and it was us Reddit in my head when I was youngerright so that potential has to meetgroundreality okay this is measured incommercial performance how much money doyou guys make the company or how muchmoney you makeyourself most collisions of yourpotential in your head and groundreality leads to ground reality winningit's actually damn hard to build asuccessful business right and a lot ofpeople who have left us to go start theexact same thing are realizing this nowit's actually damn hard to makeeverything play together and make moneyseasoned tested Talent is humble becausethey know the test ishard and has lower expectations whenyou're seasoned now you come in andyou're like okay now I know this is hardI know this is not worth taking on likethat's why I love working with peoplelike haran and Tas right they're likeyeah we can build a productbut that's crazy amount of risk for thecompany to absorb right now and the ROIisunclear most people go decades withoutthe test you could live your entire lifenot being tested on whether you havedriven leads conversion anything for thecompany but the minute you align you'relike my job whatever I'm doing has toalign to give leads to the company whenyou're editing let's say for the waronMaya Channel and you're like okay we'redoing a brand deal for this company canwe drive can we do something thatdoesn't piss off our audience but drivesmore conversions for the company what'sa better narrative instead of somebodyelse telling you that if you can thinkthrough that you have passed the test oryou're getting close to testing yourselfsagur is a great example of this Sagaliterally scaled a channel by himselfand he was like like he's very confidenthe can do it again that's the thingabout the test once people have pass thetest they're confident now I can do itone more time I can do it two more timesnext slide okay I'm going to change thetable till now I've been speaking as anemployer now I want to tell you how youcan take advantage ofme and all of them this is how employeescan now leverage and take advantage oftheir employers right this also forpeople online it all flips around onceyou passed the test once something youhave done has led to commercialmeaningful commercial outcomes whetherdirectly or as directly as possible someof you are slightly indirect like anengineer would be slightly indirect butstill you'll know whether you'vecontributed to some outcome you have anew asset the asset isleverage you have proven leverage if youcan perform again and again you gaineven more leverage you know why peoplereally come to us today at least on thecontent side we do the AI side and thecontent side people really come to us onthe content sidebecause we get peopleperformance eight out of 10 times surewe still fail 20% of the time becausethis content so hard but eight or 10times when a client comes to us we getthem the views on the AI businessBusiness Solution side when a clientcomes to us like Amazon Prime forexample we do such a good job on thefirst one and we' lost money on thefirst one where the second time theycome back and they love us they built arelationship and that relationshipcontinues to compound so if you canperform again and again you get evenmore leverage and people with leveragecan demand any price they want and arewidely sof sought after the table is notlike once you gain leverage it's notthat you make 10% increment 20%increment you can ask for whatever youwant once you have real leverage andthis cannot be faked with credit takingwe have too many people who go out thereand say I built AOS Ibuilt Labs we really have these kind ofpeople by the way it's so stupid becauseeveryone like I said they do D they callus so you cannot fake this with credittaking because eventually okay even ifyou get a deal saying I'm really greatat content Ed for this other company andI did everything end to end the othercompany can you perform for them becauseif you don't perform for them thennext slide there are nine types ofLeverage okayskill managementability experience in a specificdomain relationships and distributioncash data assets technology brand nextslide okay skill and Technology aregetting commoditized and maybe alsobecause of how we've built the companyright uh video editors is not a likefinding a skilled video editor is notlike a like an insane challenge for usit's getting commoditized finding a veryskilled developer today especially afterlots of people are being laid off is nottoo much of a challenge and even thetechnology it's not like today Hollywoodhas some you know there was a time bythe way when I was younger I went tothis some animation Academy when I waslike very very young right to learnanimation and that time they hadexclusive licenses of Maya I don't knowwhether they had pirated it or what butthat was like 3D software 3ds Max andMaya I was like crazy these guys havethis software how do I don't I don'tknow how to get it at home and they areon discs and all today everyone hasblender in 3D so the tech there was atime where live streaming only fewcompanies can do now everyone can do sotechnology is getting commoditized overtime so you have to rely on one of thesefewthings next slide okay let me tell yousomething about skill okay Supply demandeconomics exists in all kinds ofLeverage to okay for example we posted apost recently about we have a job boarddo you know this on super DM we got1,600 rums for full stack developers butjust four rums for VFX artists if youare and this is more for people onlineright because everyone here already hasa job if you're looking for a job whywould you do add one more number herewhy not add one number here sure thenumber of companies here hiring islesser but the competition here is somuch more I think it's better to do thisand do Discovery a little better no youcan't go where the traffic is if you'relooking for a job especially and this iseven for people here who might belooking for a job outside for WhateverWhenever 3 years later 5 years laterwhenever it is tomorrow whenever it isyou can't go by the traffic is you haveto do something sufficiently differentfrom the rest of the world that theworld really needs being early to a newindustry or solving a problem for Lesssexy industry is better and again morefor the people online wherethere's a line of people outside of credsaying I want to be a designer for credbut that same line isn't standing for areal estate company and if you're a gooddesigner and you're able to build arelationship like I said relationship isa leverage you can get paid just as muchin a good real estate company helpingthem sell their products they make moremoney they make real hard cash for VCSin 2021 and this is the other side ofthe table right cash was not theleverage as Supply demand gottemporarily skewed in 2021 if you wentand said you know one VC is ging me 3crores 10 other VCS are standing in linesaying 3.1 CR 3.5 CR that time is overbut that time cash stop being TheLeverage for a short period of time soyou need to find what has leveragenow okay so and this is also all theselever also the intangibles you get fromworking in the company when people lookatpackage okay you see okay I'm gettingwhatever X number of laks per 10 lakhsinm 20 lakhs inm 5 lakhs inm but you'renot seeing that every company gives youintangiblesnot only is a company helping you gainskill okay because you're working on thejob that's the only that's the best wayto learn you're also Learning Managementability because you're managed by peopleabove you you learn okay like a Baratwill say okay this is how Harsha isdoing this okay maybe I should learnfrom that because Hasa has had a fewyears doing management right but youalso get the opportunity to managedown right so for example in Ian wouldbe like okay how do I handle how do Imanage dops or theyan should be like howdo I manage the dopsyou learn that experience the hard wayright okus has learned the hard way howto manage peopledownwards how do I deal with this so yougain that experience right some this notthis cannot be taught it's very hard toteach this experience in a specificdomain so if you're working let's saywith us you gain experience with contentwe are mainly focused on content and youlearn a lot right if you're a developerand you're here you still learn so muchmore about content if you're a filmmakeryou're like oh this is how VFX is doneyou see all the experiments happeninglife so you learn stuff then there'srelationships and distribution tomorrowif you want to start a company the bestpeople to start a company with eventhough I'm shooting myself in the footfor saying this is people around you Ididn't have this network when I wasyoungEngineers you know software Engineersdesigners uh VFX artists video editorssome robotics guys sitting there rightso you have like this relationship setthat you build and even if if it's notlike you going and starting a companywith them that's too risk that that'shigh risk it could also be like maybeyou move on and you need some help fromsomebody somebody who in the industrywho know something you have peoplearound you very hard to do especiallylots of kids who want to do this workfrom home you have zero like you'rebasically losing this entire leverageeven the experience you're losingleverage because some you can just walkto our studio and be like okay what areyou guys up to right which you don'tgain work from home this is for thepeople online especially then there'scash there's a difference between doingsomething by yourself and doingsomething with company resources all thefilmmakers here the equipment we havetoday which we built over the last let'ssay 4 months how how would you get thisotherwise be expensive right so you'rebasically using the assets and the cashof the company to do things that youwouldn't have been able to do otherwiseright and even I see it the same way bythe way my company's assets are not minemy company it's not like I own thecompany's assets and you know it's likeI get to take it home every day it'slike okay this is an asset I use it andit's also for use for everybody elselet's see if we can use these togenerate more cash if we have bettergreen screens or whatever it is rightthen there's of course data and I thinkwe have now some data here and there toknow not just in terms of insights dataas in which clients but also in terms ofwe have our backend YouTubedashboards we know roughly what workswhat doesn't you know for many years Iused to go to many creators I've donethis with sharan I've done this with tanI've done this with probably everyCreator I've met show me YouTubedashboard I want to see yourstats I'm notorious for doing this soI'll go I'll see the stats I like I'llbe like okay why is this low why is thathigh why did this video do well so datais very valuable and data only comesfrom proximity right like sitting nextto somebody then of course technologywhich again in our case is assets andthen there's a brand today you wouldrather intern at Apple forzero for zero pay then get paid 30k amonth at some Lalu Prasadcompanywhy cuz your next employer will look atApple on your CV and say oh my God heworked at Apple I'll tell you one thingwe have also been guilty of this ifthere's a big name on a CV we will takean interview like theying like let's seeif he's good or not like the one way tobe uncluttered in interview is go to acompany that people recognize seriouscompanies like I spoke about so if youworked at any serious company from thezero of the world to the blinket of theworld whatever if we recognize the nameand to be honest withAOS we are now even though we're veryyoung we starting to become morerecognizable so AOS on your CV meanssomething it's not baked into your CDCbut it's meaning something to your lifebut the minute you stay there for threemonths and then say I built AOS thatdoesn't work you got to be there for awhile and people look at how long you'vebeen at a certain place somebody's goneto like you know like a Facebook butwork there for 2 months even we don'ttake it seriously employers are not dumbnext slide yeah this is a truth youcan't say on social media by the way I'mtaking a risk by saying it one of you isgoing to feed mepoison which is that actually interningfor zero at an apple will do more foryour career we don't have an internshipI don't think we do internships at thecompany we just do full-time salariesfor everyone we just like let's not getinto this junj but interning at Applefor zero will do more for your careerthan a 50k per month job at some no-namecompany because it's apple and applerarely hdes that's such a that's such afilter rightso that's brand leverage in action andthis is a truth you can't say on socialmedia right that's why I said you can'tsay enough truths on social media nextslide now I'm going to tell youimportant part how to negotiate for arace okay I'm telling you a little bitof founder psychology so I'll tell you alittle bit of my my psychology and thefounders we have here and also thefounders outside most Founders arelonely they've been through a 5 10 yearJourney before they are in a positionwhere they can give you good cash orthey're VC funed and you know I don'tknow what works for them because they'renot really thinking it through they'renot stable companies either bootstrapFounders will never part with cash upfront unless there's appropriate valueprovision okay so if you come to me andyou say vun there's this project andit's making X andI'm I'm why in this and then after allyour whatever costs you're still makinggood this thing or you're expandingrevenue for us if you come in and youexpand revenue for me that's a very bigdeal for me like with the Hardware teamnow with the experiments team now we'retrying some VFX because if that worksthat expands revenue for us right sothat I don't mind taking up The Upfrontrisk for it because I'm like okay if itworks I can see how it expands RevenueFounders really value loyalty there usedto be a time where how many of youbelieve so there's two things rightloyalty and meritocracy you know whatmeritocracy is what's a meritocracybasis Merit basis skill there if I wereto promote choose between two people andpromote them or or give them benefitswho would I choose Merit and loyaltywhat should I chooserationally okay everyone saidMerit some people are saying loyaltyokay somebody who said Merit tell me whyMerit mhm because like one paper isbetter than skill wise okay why wouldthe other people choose loyalty actuallyone of the one of those guys there tellme Hara why would you choose actuallywill any of you choose loyaltyyeah okay why would you choose loyalty Ichoose loyaltylongyISM loyaltylongm yeah so because I have a mic onI'll just repeat what he said he said inthe short-term meritocracy works in thelong-term loyalty is better I'll tellyou what the one of the challenges ofbeing extremelymeritocracy with being a pure Merit Augright so people come in they'reextremely you know good at what they dobut the problem is like I said skill iscommoditizing right and actually it'sfinding I'm finding it harder to keeppeople for like 2 years 3 years whateverwe're young and we mostly we've managedto keep everybody but most Founders havea hard time keeping really good talentbecause really good talent right now isis very distracted so it doesn't matterhow good you are if you aren't willingto commit for a year or two years rightfor a while what's the purpose of beinggood if you can't commit it's likesaying I'm getting married but for onemonth but she's the best girlever it's useless it's like it's not ait's not something that's valuableespecially through the hard years justlike we're having good times today wewill have bad times at some point I'mdamn sure of it because I've eaten dirtfor 10 years so Founders really valueloyalty especially during the hard timesright and extraction of value from arelationship again I'm batting for yourside is best done after few years cuzit's very hard to say they go one monthyou know I've done this I'm very loyalto you now give this thing there havebeen people around for a year two yearsactually people who are making the mostamount of money in this company arepeople who' have been with me for manymany years and I'm sure they will treattheir employees in the same way you'vestuck around with them for 3 four yearsyou get everything especially as thecompany does better you get more andmore and more if you've been around fora while cuz we know we can trust you weknow we can count on you that's thehardest thing today actually andknowledge of a company situation isvaluable if a particular company companyand especially because we are a bunch ofcompanies if you know that the companyis doing well it's easier for you to askfor a raise if you know a company'smargins are lower it is harder for youto ask for a race right and it's bestdone after a few years so our race cycleis once a year so let's say you join onFeb first you you can only talk about araise Feb first the next year sowhenever you join one year from thereyou can ask for a raise we don't doMidway Rays we're not too big for thatto you know continuously revise numbersor whatever and we're also not there wasa time when we started where we didn'thave crazy budgets but now we don't havewe still don't have crazy budgets but wepay everyone Market salary or close toMarket salary what you're looking forfor success in general this is not justrelated to you is you're looking for afast growing company fast growing interms of profit not in head count profitwith close proximity to decision makersthere are companies you would work atmaybe real estate and all that where youwouldn't even be able to talk to thefounders you won't even know what'sgoing on in their head you won't evenknow what's important to them right sofast growing company close proximity todecision makers in profit successfulFounders are tested and hence valuehumility dude I had a guy come the otherday to the office I'm not going to takenames but the most 20 years old obviousnormal I was like that probably where hecame and he's like you know we're doingthis we know this zero humility right ofunderstanding that this is damn hard anddoing this 10 20 years it'll burn youout anyway whatever so good Foundersvalues humility if you come to me andsay this is 100% going to work I'll belikereally you'll prove it to me 100% willwork but I prefer people who come andsay there's a 50% chance this will workand these three parts I don't know butwe'll figure it out right I love peoplewho can figure it out I love workingwith people who can figure it out notjust me every founder if you say vun Iwill take time but I'll figure it outand if it's not possible I'll tell youit's not possible and you want anaccurate assessment sometimes Vishalcomes to me and like it's not workingit's a problem with this system I'll belike no I've tried it before it worksand then he'll tweak it and it'll workand he'll be like yeah it's working nowso as much as I respect Vishal for likealways eventually figuring it out italso worries me when he gives me aninaccurateassessment right sometimes okas doesthis inaccurate assessment of whereit'll go so I I I'm I like optimism mostFounders like optimism but you have towe don't mind people saying we don'tknow or we'll figure it outuh but you can't use that for everythingSteve Jobs has this quote between thejanitor and the CEO excuses stopmattering so the janitor you know whatthat means like if maid comes in andMaid says door B fair I understand ourargument but if you the CEO and you sayI wasn't able to add whatever my Targetin Revenue nobody's going to save youyou can't give an excuse if you're anexecutive and you're being paid anexecutive you have to get results byhook or crook last thing staying in thecompany for long periods of time is ahidden level leverage and we have proofof that in the company Tas Hara they'vebeen with me in previous companies alsosidhant uh you know staying stayingaround really matters and actuallyhaving lower expectations also reallymatters because Ron is an example ofthis where he came in he had lowexpectations and then he did just didsuch a good job that we like you youhave won my trust right let's dosomething cool together okay this is thelast slide I thinkof but one slide so you now can go breakout for lunch dinner whatever itis uh there are three ways to make bigmoney the first one is you stay in afast Growth Company for years and hopefor your esops to materialize most ofthe time it doesn't work out so youcould join like a the next startup thatraises $30million straight out the bat join themhope the esops materialize you're notbetting on anything apart you're notbetting on the founders ability to buildtechnologyyou're not betting on the Founder'sability to do marketing you're bettingon the founders ability to make profitokay and not just profit but also IPObecause most people who I'll tell youthe problem the problem is most peoplewho can make profit won't IPO especiallyif you know how to make good profit doyou knowwhy why would you want to be controlledby themarket every day anything you doanything you say the market saying goodthings bad things about you you can'tlive your life it's like being inshackles private company bootstrap isthe best the minute you've raisedfunding also you have to listen toinvestors so most people who can turn aprofit they to them esops is not asmeaningful but still if you look at zerothat they do BuyBacks they buy back someof the esops over time so there are waysit can work out but you're reallybetting on somebody's ability to doprofit for most of you any ESOP you getin any company whether here or outsidejust assume it's worth zero toilet paperbasically the next thing is start acompany at an inflection point somethinghas just changed and you think there's acompany required here it's very riskytakes 10 years to work out timing has tobe perfect actually I don't know if youknow this but I've been doing 3D avatarstuff now for like four 5 years muchlonger than that I started with gameengines when I was with reality Factorylike I was 13 or something 13 14 orsomething and there are videos of me oldvideos where even before metahuman wewere doing like a 3D avatar right sowe've been doing this Avatar replacement for a long time it's just now it'sbecome good on on reals on andshsum so you need to also time it such thatwhat will be popular in 10 years takethe risk now and then play out those 10years in life very very hard to do it'sreally hard to do and last the easiestway in my opinion gain leverage and getto a senior position at a well-knowncompany and work for 20 to 25 years thisis something never told on social mediait will take you 20 years to makeseriousmoney if you work here or anywhere elseand I can guarantee you you for most ofyou it will take this much time to makegoodmoney retirement level money 20 25 yearsjust like it was for yourparents nobody wants to hear this you'relike 5 years how do I get a lamboginiand get out ofthis but it takes time even if you'redamn smart even if you're damn connectedit takes time last thing is gambleinvest in some crazy risky thing somenew coin this that whatever some orthe other keeps coming out but therethe risk is almost certain and you butyou'll still find one guy you know whohas invested in like some something andthey've made 100x their money orwhatever and then you'll be like butthat's the problem by the time the guysinvested it's already too late now youcan't invest and make that money butyou'll have such people you should neverlook at them and say oh he's doingbetter in life than me he gambled andwon it's like looking at a guy who won alottery ticket and being like andenvying his life it's so strange I I'veseen it with some of you rightespecially with the crypto boom and youlooked at your friends making some crazymoney in crypto like oh you made so muchmoney but it's like looking at some guywho won a lottery ticket and saying whydoes he have oh he made so much moneyyou don't envy a lottery ticket guyslifestyle so why are you envying thecrypto guys lifestyle it's fine it's onewins 100 day anyway do you have anyotherslides that was long and I'm sorry fortaking so much time but Ithink it was important that I told youhow youngsters were thinking because 90%% of you were kind of thinking somethingalong these lines I thought might aswell tell you what it took for us andhow long it'll generally take nobodywants to plan out 20 years of their lifebut you need to right and we don't knowwhat's going to happen in 20 years AImight come anything can happen butlong-term loyalty really matters in anycompany especially as AI comes aroundthe corner and skill becomes less andless important loyalty and just beingaround being able to absorbresponsibility and riskmatters yeah that's itfor everyone online bye",
    "summary": "This YouTube video transcript is a guide to working in a company in 2024, focusing on the modern Indian workforce. It discusses the distorted expectations and misinformation prevalent among young professionals due to social media, emphasizing the gap between perceived potential and tested performance. The speaker argues that social media often presents unrealistic scenarios of quick wealth and easy success, leading to a \"damaged brain\" mentality. He stresses the importance of understanding the \"rules of engagement\" – what companies expect from employees and vice versa – to navigate the current job market effectively. Serious companies value execution, problem-solving skills, and the ability to deliver outcomes over mere theoretical knowledge. The speaker also highlights the difference between \"serious\" and \"unserious\" companies, advocating for working with the former where real cash flow and client service are prioritized.\n\nThe transcript delves into the misconceptions surrounding equity, emphasizing that it's a reward for risk-taking, not just for doing work. ESOPs are often overvalued, and employees should focus on demonstrating value and contributing to the company's financial success. The speaker deconstructs the financial realities of running a company, revealing the numerous hidden expenses beyond salaries, and explaining why companies charge clients significantly more than individual employee pay. He distinguishes between \"founder\" types and the importance of loyalty and proven performance when negotiating raises.\n\nFinally, the speaker offers advice on how employees can leverage their position, emphasizing the importance of building relationships, gaining domain expertise, and acquiring intangible assets like brand recognition and internal knowledge of company data. He concludes with three paths to financial success: staying at a fast-growing company, starting a company at an inflection point (high risk), or gaining leverage and seniority at a well-known company over 20-25 years (long-term commitment). He cautions against relying solely on gambling or lottery-style investments for quick wealth."

    "transcript": "Hi folks!This is GKCS and we are talking\nabout the Model Context protocol.Now this is something\nwhich has tremendous potential.But I think because there is so much hype\nin the AI space right nowthat people have completely missed\nthe potential of this new protocol.the current problem\nwith large language modelsis that they have some intelligence.They can tell you what you should do,\nbut they can't do the thing for you.They can't take actions they can only give\noutputs in text or other mediums.Let's take an example.You are a software engineer\nand you have a production outage,Now, what you want to dois pick up all the requests\nwhich have been coming to this server.Run the request locally.Look at where you have the problem.Make the code changes for it.And then deploy this new branch to main.If this tedious process\ncould be taken up by a large languagemodel, then you would require\nless engineers to do the same jobs.And youcould send the engineers to Goa\ninstead of having them on call.so with this basic idea\nthat you want your large language modelto not only give you advice or give you\nthe steps that you need to follow,but also actually do things for you comesthe model context protocol, MCP.This enables a two party system\nwhere you have clients who are largelanguage models, and you have servers\nwho are typical servers exposing APIs.the client, can send a request\nto the serverto do something This isn't a new concept.the unique thing about this is that\nyou have some sort of intelligence here.A large language model can decide\nwhat to do based on the current situation.There was\nI have triple T, which used to allow youto take events from external systems\nand react to them.but LMS are smarter than just\nif as conditions they can takethe decision\nrequired In the given situation.okay,\nso that's the most basic use case for MCP.What other use cases can you see?Three major ones.The first one is search\nengine optimization.This is where Google ranks your pagebased on how relevant\nit finds it for an incoming query.So if someone searches for system\ndesign courseand if InterviewReady comes on top,\nthen my startup benefitsbecause the chance of people\nactually purchasing the coursejust increases, Because it's more\nsearchable, it's more discoverableSo now the traditional search\nengine optimization,which tries to rank\nyou on top, is no longer sufficient.You're\nlooking for a slightly different approachwhere your website should be linked\nto create the consolidated result.How do you increase the chances of this?Well, if you have MCP servers,which are exposing APIs\nthe chance of your website coming in.The final result is quite high.I'll take an example.Let's say you want to get the top\n100 rank coders on code forces.And you could do this by scraping pages,but it would be much better,\nmuch faster, much more structured.If you had an explicit\nAPI available on an MC server,which could be accessed\nby a large language model.Now the last language model goes hits\nthat API,gets that response in a structured way,\nuses it to create the final response.And so we maysee a major change in how SEO is done\nacross websites.Earlier you would look at light speed.You would look at how quicklya response came, how quickly your web page\nloaded, how accessible it was.With large language models.Your page may not be accessed by a human.It might be accessed by a lamp,\nwhich doesn't really care so muchabout the look and feel,\nor how easy it is to read.As long as the information\nis there, it's code.And maybe you'relooking for more information\nthan is usually readable by a human being.So things are still very, very new.The field is being called Elmo, which\nstands for Language Model Optimization.everything which is considered goodsearch engine optimization\nprinciple is also being applied here.There are two other major\nuse cases for MCP servers.The first one is retrieval\naugmented generation.This has been in AI for the last six\nmonths and it has lived up to its hype.Because now when you ask\nGPT for the latest information,it doesn't say, oh,\nI haven't been updated up to that point.So I can't answer that query. No.It goes searches online, finds relevant\ndata sources, fetches them.Converts that data into vectors\nand uses them to answer your queryin the best way possible.It could also be using local data sources\nwhich are updatedat a different frequency.Let's say once every hour versus the model\nwhich is updated once every six months.So what you have done is separated\nthe frequency of data,updates to the frequency of model updates.This really helpsbecause model training is very expensive\nwhile fetching data is super cheap.So retrieval augmented generation\ngets better through Amqp because nowthe external sources can answer\nyour queries, you know, better format.And also much faster.and the final major use case\nI see for MXGp servers is applications.an example of\nthis is a user asking to rent a carThis has always been a difficult\nuse case for search engines,If you list these out, then\nthe user has to individually search these.How can large language models do better?Aggregator websites?Aggregate websites, take all of the top\nsearch results and try to condense theminto one place where a user can compare\ndifferent cars, compare the cost,compare the size and everything else,\nand then make a decision.So now the aggregate result\nhas to turn into an aggregator MQB API.If you are looking to find the best car\nto rent,the MQB server\nwhich you have created in your applicationcan go and fetch results\nfrom different websites,aggregate it into a single API\nand give that response to the LM.The benefit for that\nLM is that this response is much faster,it is better consolidated,And the benefit for you is either\nthe LM paying you for using your API orthe websites who are scraping paying you\nto rank themselves higher in the result.it's almost like\nyou can charge these websitesto put up their ads in your MC\nserver response,which is eventually going to be consumed\nby an LM to give the final output.now this hasn't happened yet.The monetization part of MXGp servers\nis not very clear,and the ecosystem is very young.But I do predict this change coming\nin the future where large language models,even if they don't explicitly show\nyou ads, may be forced to show you thingswhich other people have paid for\nbecause they are hyped up.The content is boosted\nbefore an LM can pass that content.So that's majorly it for model context\nprotocol.It's got a lot of potential,\nbut whether it will be realized or notdepends on the large companies right now.Google opening.I can decide to accept this as a way\nto interact with different servers.Or they can just ignore it completely.Or they can hack this protocoland make their own versions out of it,\nlike they did with Android.thank you for watching this video.If you have any doubts or suggestions,\nyou can let me know in the comments below.If you liked the video, then hit the\nlike button and I'll see you next time.Bye bye!One small thing aroundthe future of these kind of protocols.I don't mean to say MCP\nis going to make it big, but I can see onemajor improvement over the protocol,\nwhich would really helpmake this much more useful.The mainbenefit of MCP is that it\nlets you perform actionsBut it would be really nice\nif the actions could be more capablein the sense if I have to send an emailwithout Gmail access,\nI can't send an email.So what if Gmail had an MCP server?If it did, it would need authorization\nfrom my sidebefore any emails are sent by ChatGPT \nusing the MCP server.Because it's my email address,\nI have to say yes before an email is sent.Now, there already exists\nsomething around this.It's called auth, where when you're\nlogging into a website and you don't wantto add your email and password, again,\nyou just go and sign in with Google.what Google does is it\nhijacks the page and asksyou permission to share your email\naddress with this new server.If you say yes,\nthen the server gets your email addresssigned by Google\nso it knows that you are an actual userwith this email address\nand it can just log you in.but the potential is much bigger.I tend to be ready\nwith calendar permissionsfor any kind of future zoom classes\nIf these two protocols come together,then you can have tremendous capability\nin the MCP serverbacked by tremendous permissions\nthrough the websites, which we often use.This is where I see the future\nfor large language models.It's very similar to agents,\nkind of like personal agents,but building personal agents\nper person is really hard.If the larger companies\npick up more serversor some sort of capability servers\nthat large language models can use,then you see the amount of human work\nreduced dramatically.And I hope that it happens.I hope the mundane things that we do\nin life reduce a little bit.In fact, I am going to create an MCP\nserver for InterviewReady.(just for learning purposes\nand understanding how this works)I'll make it open source so that all of us\ncan contribute and learn along the way.If you want to share it on your LinkedIn\nor resume, please go ahead.Feel free.I link the GitHub\nrepo in the description below.Thank you for watching this\nand I'll see you next time. Bye bye!",
    "summary": "The video introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a crucial step toward enabling large language models (LLMs) to take actions, not just provide advice. The core idea is to create a two-party system where LLMs act as clients, requesting specific tasks from servers exposing APIs. This allows LLMs to leverage their intelligence to decide what actions to take based on the current context, moving beyond simple if-then scenarios. The speaker highlights the potential of MCP to automate tedious tasks, illustrated by the example of a software engineer resolving a production outage, suggesting that LLMs could eventually handle such processes with less human intervention.\n\nThe video then explores three major use cases for MCP. First, search engine optimization (SEO) will evolve into \"Language Model Optimization\" (LMO), where websites optimize for LLM access, focusing on structured data and code rather than solely human readability. Second, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) benefits from MCP because external sources can answer LLM queries in better formats and at a much faster rate. The third use case lies in applications, exemplified by car rentals. MCP servers can aggregate results from various websites into a single API for LLMs, offering faster and more consolidated information. The speaker also touches on the potential for monetization within the MCP ecosystem, envisioning scenarios where websites pay to have their content prioritized in LLM outputs. While the ecosystem is young and monetization unclear, the future could involve LLMs incorporating paid content into their responses.\n\nFinally, the speaker suggests that MCP's potential could be amplified by integrating authorization protocols like OAuth. This would allow LLMs to perform actions with user permission, such as sending emails through Gmail, leading to more capable and personalized \"personal agents.\" He acknowledges that realizing MCP's potential hinges on adoption by major companies and the willingness of users to grant permissions. The speaker concludes by announcing the creation of an open-source MCP server for InterviewReady, encouraging community contribution and learning in this evolving field."

time always this post isgoing to be about our motivations forthe move and what replacementimplementation looks like this post isnot a critique of node.js Lambda orserverless movement but a word ofcaution about how pricey it can becomeif your services end up going web scale database trademarked uh we startedwith the original service was designedto collect uh an event stream fromvarious web

API Gateway kesa stream Json schemof validation Lambda all sorts of crazymagic okay this looks like every singleproject dude basic AF okay I love thisarticle this article is so good APIGateway we bound our API client endpointdirectly to a Kinesis stream usingvelocity templates so that thedownstream Lambda function could takethe advantage of Lambda Kinesisfunctionality and can currently beinvoked to process batches of HTTP postswe knew that the service would behandling lots of HTTP requests at a timeand did not want to run into throttlingissues with Lambda so processing it offa Que in batches was a solid Choice okayI mean batching is always a good planKinesis our Kinesis stream has varied insize of bit but if I recall correctlyits highest throughput was 60 to 80shards to avoid getting rightprovisioned throughput exceeded that's alot of shards our Lambda was in chargeof pulling batches off the queuevalidating that the data made sensecollecting metrics on our metricscollect

a time for processing everything ishunky dory for now this is a great thisis actually a great introduction theygave us the meat they gave it to us rawand we got none of the Annoying Partsall right the system workedfantastically for well over a year itscaled very easily required almost zeroattention this is good I mean this is agood argument for why relying on otherpeople's INF structure such a greatargument is cuz you don't have to do to it when you build it it justworks it's fantastic absolutely in theremore teams and projects on the companybegan to interface with it andthen beautiful Daddy basos coming inhot let's go then it got expensive whywe needed a change API Gateway alonecost about$3.5 per million HTP requests that'sawesome I can run my side projects on itfor free I can build stuff in it ratherquickly and get things done but when itscale so does the bill our let's see ourservices our service didn't quite growexponentially in use but it did hockeystick it went from free to a few hundredto around $112,000 just for API Gatewayno Kinesis no Lambda just API Gateway weare doing about 5 million requests perhour you telling me it only cost 350 permillion be about 350 uh I can't believeI did not recognize tree fit like it wasright there tree fitti was right thereand you're telling me I didn't even seeit uh 12,600 that's a lot of threefitties yeah again there is no lambdasdoing business logic yet that's justcash to get the events in that spend issustainable but obviously a waste and weknew that we were going to be addingadditional load to the system in thenear future currently we were processingup to 12 million events perhour let's do a math if we stayed on aPi Gateway and Lambda all right we're upto 30,000 30,000 glad we dodged that onethere's 30 days in a month classic 30days in a month uh bleeding uh let's seefrom bleeding cash to let it crashthat's an earling joke okay I don't getit so a lot of people ask me why not gothis is a great qu this dude I love thisquestion I've only written a few C tuesand created a few PRS in go I am not nordo I pretend to be a go Guru we had asystem running at a high scale and Icould risk building it in something Ididn't know how to write efficientefficiently and operate that's one ofthe Beauties about go you pretty muchalways write it pretty efficiently uhaside I did build the to prototype inRust for uh for fun one weekend but itfelt irresponsible to deploy it with theG given I had absolutely zero rustexperience dude this is such a greattake you know we all love these bespokeartisanal languages but man is thathilarious why not node it was alreadywritten in node actually most of thecode consuming parts were written interraform to deploy it all and velocitytemplates to do some inflate requestmanipulation to in uh ingest intoKinesis the node Lambda was rathersimple it pulled off batches validatedthem and send them on their way down tothe second Kinesis stream if I was goingto uh set up my own Express server orwhatever and then it would only bereplacing API Gateway portion and mygoal is to replace the Gateway and theLambda in one operation uh get the prepreliminary Kinesis stream out uh out ofthere uh this Lambda was originallyprocessing batches and shipping offbatches now the function functionhandling individual requests would alsoneed to handle the batching we did notwant to hit Kinesis with a single recordat a time okay I don't know what Kinesisis what iskinesis I've heard the word Kinesis like18 times I don't really work with Amazonwhat is Kinesis is what is it what's thething what does it do someone tell meit's a AWS cfco or CFA alternative ohokay ohokay the keyboard maker the Amazon Qokay is that the SNS sqs stuff is thatlike the proper name behind it yeah nookay that's different I've only used sqsand SNS right stuff and only very littleof it sqs is a separate product okayit's a big data streams oh okay yeahI've never really yeah I mean I playedwith CFA at Netflix I've never playedwith it anywhere else we have our owninternal Kafka stuff and mantis andRaven Raven on top of mantis on top ofKafka there's a lot of there's a lot ofabstractions there okay it's a lotthere's a lot of things anyways to getthe preliminary C uh oh we alreadytalked about this so if I let's see soif I built it in node I would ra let'ssee I would rather have to I wouldeither have to hack up some Globalvariable to save my state in or uh in ordepend on some external data store likereddis to mcash or mcash why not Cobaltno one asked me that it's a valuablequestion to be asked but why Elixir uhthis system has to be up when the restof the world falls apart this tool isused for debugging issues in clientsoftware that runs on a lot of highttrffic websites it also has to beabsolutely fast our client library isfor sending lots of information per pageload in a lot of customers appwe can't go slowing down our customersuser experience at the same time wedecided since we are running our ownHTTP interface now that we should givefeedback 400 bad requests if the data isinvalid to the developer per requestinstead of making them look at what thereporting tool down the line keep theusers's experience good make thedevelopers experience better okay it'scool and I enjoy writing and reading ithonestly one of the most valid reasonsuh I can take I mean again this is thetruest form of DX I can take advantageof language features to reduce the needfor external dependencies like Ristermcash okay that's cool too actuallyletting it crash like all softwareprojects I shipped this to production Iforgot everything right from the firsttime or hold on like all softwareprojects I shipped this to productionand got everything right the first timeand it worked fantastically everyonepaded me on the back and said good jobwe shared egregious high fives andpeople actually carried me out of theoffice on a chair over their heads yepJK I screwed this bad boy up a few timesand pretty sure I set a server on firesomewhere in the AWSregion my first attempt handling theHTTP request is the easy part but I hadthe batch up data to ship off to Kinesisone way to use aw Kinesis H HTTP API butthey also have a Kinesis agent that I'verun on Plenty of servers so I figured Iwould use Elixir built-in logger moduleand run a sidecar container with Kinesisagent configured to ship my logs deadsimple nice well that BW uh that BWlet's see well that blew to bits quicklyThe Elixir standlogger mentions Alternatives betweensync and async modes to uh remainperformant when required but alsoapplies back pressure when understress there's no way I'm going to dothat that pretty much sounds likeeverything I've ever done in my lifetimeliterally every single time I thinkthat's not going to happen that happensI don't recall the exceptions off handbecause this was the quickest I've evershut down a multivar test or rolled backcode but I drove the logger straightinto the ground request times rocketedskyrocketed many memory went off therails and I started seeing all sorts oferrors or all sorts of crashes in thelogger process steam started coming outof everything and I swear I saw asprocket fly off I kind of backed awayslowly from that approach my secondattempt I wanted to make sure Icircumvented any back pressure I neededto keep the request super fast so Ireplaced the logger module with a simpleright to a file that Kinesis agent wouldread from writing files in Elixir alsohappens through a process but you canopen up a raw access to a file okay Ilike it I like it here's a little bit ofcode little style for little Styleoh my goodness style forage storage filea little file storage a behavior eventstream storage new line okay I don'tknow what any of this means because thisisn't that fake ass language Elixirwhich I what am I looking at I don'teven know what I'm looking at what isthis what is that I don't know what thatis seems fake write file log filemessage

this allows me uh tohave a nice easily inspectableimplementation of the store in my testSuite oh that's nice yeah good jobtraits are great uh this actually workedamazing request times dropped so low Ithought it wasn't working then Ram wentcrazy things are obviously a skew when aweb server is using 10 gab of ram thiswasn't Elixir fault it wasn't kesafaults either anyone know what it was Imentioned a sidecar container Above Thisis running in uh in kubernets and threecontainers Elixir Kinesis log rotate aresharing a volume that volume behind thescenes is running with temp FS which isan in-memory

pars them I don'tknow I hope notI know this is getting real this isgetting real this explanation isthorough oh my goodness just I mean thisiswhy I don't see for the near futuredevops being anything but a growingcareer path is because there's so muchrequired in all of this you know what Imean like the amount of stuff requiredto know understand and be fast at isinsane I think devops is the only thingthatRivals like the front-end ecosystem forjust the amount of insanity that thereis like the amount of things you have tocome up with and do is really fun but Iwill say that in like the dev

justfeels for me it just feels more fun butsome people really do love the front endI don't know it's not for me it justfeels more funright all those dollar sucking Bezosfrom Mr Bezos made me forget uh thattime honored software principle keep ituh keep it simple or keep it simpleme the solution was a few gen servers uhfor people not uh from the llang orElixir World gen servers are a tool

torecognize that the amount of emotionaldamage that went on in this probably wasa bit higher than we'd like to we wouldlike to admit with this approach I haveone binary to ship to no externaldependencies okay that's good that'sactually really awesome this has beenworking fantastic response times aresubsecond and resource utilization isalmost constant here's a graph of CPUversus Ram during our high traffic timewell done this is great very consistentlove it love to see it and our numberswell rock on rock on the CPU usageperixir node ranges between uh 6 to 1.8under heavy uh load Ram stays prettyconsistent in the 100 to 150 rangealthough I currently over provision itjust in case how does this compare costwise it's a lot cheaper for us and mindthat we already have an Ops Team and wealready have a kubernetes clusterrunning kubernets cluster running uh ouradditional costs are the fractions of ECec2 instances that Elixir nodes areconsuming I could argue that it's freesince they are running on leftovercompute but for comparison with numbersabove I'll calculate the cost I'll useCPU since that is what our this serviceis mostly constrained by yeah that makessense our general kubernets instancegroup is running on t2.2 XLS that is 404 cents per hour and have eight virtualCPUs each so that makes about point ormakes about 5 cents uh or oo yeah yeah 5cents per CPU per hour okay we'recurrently running three to five elixirnodes using between 0.5 to two CPUs eachon the lower end$59 on the higher end$397 they went from what would be $ 30some th000 now to $500 and some Dollaron the high end or remember it's not 12K12K was the oldnumbers it went up to 30k with wherethey're at now and that's just for APIGateway remember they replaced APIGateway plus the Lambda service so thatassuming the Lambda service isn'tzero it's something right let's justassume it's notzero uh uh we haven't had an Elixir nodeuh using above 1.8 CPUs and on averagewe were running four nodes at a total of1.1 CPUs okay so$174 so should everyone go and rewritetheir server uh serverless servers inElixir roll out kubernets uh get a nosepiercing absolutelynot geta a good part of this entire systemstill runs on uh in Lambda although itwill be moving into Elixir over time tomake it easier to reason about anddevelop on locally what everybody shoulddo is think about where your service isgoing and can you afford those costswhen you get there if you don't have ateam of Ops people and you aren'tfamiliar with server full stuff spending30k a month on HTTP requests might becheaper than an OP steam absolutely thisis a great call out you got to make yougot you got to decide what sword you'regoing to fall on but if you're alreadyat 30,000 and you're planning ondoubling or tripling you got to startthinking about the future right at whatpoint do you change course and when doyou know to change course right it'sit's really about trying to predict thefuture but if you have the team you knowhow or willonce you hit the scale there is a lot ofroom for savings by running your owninfrastructure update I was asked on TheElixir Forum about the loss toleranceI'll go into that a bit more in detailhere footnotes a downside oh it'll gointo here it's some other article if youfollow the link you can find the link uhfootnotes a downside to this approachwas developers using this async serviceuh we returned 2011's and were unable totell them at the time if the data theysent was valid and ingestible yeah I Iwas wondering about that because they doa 2011 first and then they do like aanother reporting they would have to usesome additional tooling to see if theirevents made it to where they weresupposed to go okay the system uh usesitself to monitor different aspects ofitself like ratios of malformed eventsthroughput and uh workflow step countersokay interesting uh it's the compilerthat builds itself uh the back half ofthe system is still in Lambda and no JSbut the invocations are tiny compare uhin comparison to what was being invokedby the lambdas exposed to the userinteractions yeah cuz the batchinghappened here so it's one 1 15th rightuh so that means 12 million becomes whathundreds ofthousands uh 2,000 events was our sweetspot for real-time rendering of graphsoh okay you may be thinking that soundslike that can be replaced with theKinesis fire hose transform function itcould be I wasn't aware of or it didn'texist at the time our system wasoriginally designed and now that we needto get off the API Gateway it doesn'tmatter it is a rad feature though myword play is out of this worldI actually agree with this entire thingincluding point6 I actually was thinkingthis entire time this guy is aninspiration as to how to make jokes fortechnical content this is this is such agood article this is such a good articlehyper media please uh this is a goodarticle okay okay okay okay hold onthere you go the article uh that's areally good AR the article is reallyreally good IET I just love this stuffbecause you know I I'm a bit of acontrarian sometimes for the sake ofbeing a contrarian and I know that's notgood to be a contrarian for the sake ofcontrarian but when everybody tells mehow amazing serverless is and thatthere's no downsides ever andeverything's great and everything'sfantastic there's some part of it thatfeels it it it feels like I'm being liedto and I feel like I have to Simply goagainst thegrain completely just because I don'tbelieve people you know what I mean likehow many times have you been in ameeting and someone States like oh thisthing does this and you're like no itdoesn't it does not whatever you're liked we've had people be like oh Json Jsonis cheap and you're like no it's notJson is like half of what your serverdoes it's not it's amazing uh for nodewhich is harder to have long runningServices yeah you know that it's veryfunny you say those kind of thingsbecause what that says to me is thatnode is fundamentally suckyif it's hard to have a long runningservice it's not node's fault it'sJavaScript JavaScript it's just so easyto make mistakes it's so easy to do thewrong thing in I'm not convinced it isfantastic I just simply am not I'm justI'm convinced I don't like thatstatement you should you should youshould be able to write a program thatlives for a long time I don't know it'sjust strange to me anyways I'm just veryuh I I will always be very very uhcontrarian evenpotentially contrarian to a fault justbecause I want to go against the grain II don't believe when people say thingsare fantastic because I've never seensomething be fantastic so this articleis awesome it just shows that there ismore Nuance to that conversation it'snot as cheap or as free as people makeit but if you don't have the team or theexperience sometimes it's worth having afake engineer who's worth $400,000 ayear on your team because it takes careof everything for youyou know what I mean thename is the primagen",
    "summary": "The video summarizes a blog post about migrating a service from a serverless architecture (AWS API Gateway and Lambda) to Elixir. The original service collected event streams from web browsers and ingested them into an ETL pipeline. Initially, the serverless setup worked well and scaled easily, but as usage grew, API Gateway costs skyrocketed to $12,000, then $30,000 per month.\n\nThe author chose Elixir as a replacement due to its speed, reliability, and the developer's familiarity with the language. Elixir's features reduced the need for external dependencies like Redis or Memcached. The migration wasn't without challenges; initial attempts to use Elixir's logger module with a Kinesis agent sidecar failed due to backpressure issues. The author then tried writing directly to a file on an in-memory file system, which led to excessive memory usage. Finally, the author implemented a solution using GenServers for asynchronous processing and batching, achieving sub-second response times and low resource utilization.\n\nThe new Elixir-based service reduced infrastructure costs from tens of thousands of dollars to a few hundred. The video emphasizes that serverless isn't always the most cost-effective solution at scale, and the decision to migrate should be based on a careful consideration of costs, team expertise, and future growth. The author also mentions the importance of DX, developer experience, and choosing tools that developers enjoy using. The video concludes by highlighting the need for nuance in the serverless conversation and acknowledging that while serverless can be beneficial, it's not always the \"fantastic\" solution it's often portrayed to be, especially without a dedicated team to manage it."

    "transcript": "we will say no to people even if theircoding and system design is good thisguy was a principal engineer at Amazonhe conducted thousands of interviewswhile he was there and last month I wentto his Studio to ask him to teach meeverything he knows about interviewingin big Tech he also shared a ton ofunexpected stories H from his promotionto principal engineer at Amazon how manypeople are expected to be cut in Amazontypically what I can sayis the PIP or performance Improvementplan and then what about the worstmanager you had yeah I don't want toname names or anythingbut I know that you came from a liberalarts background um your major going intocollege was actually English right yeahI was creative writing and and Englishliterature so can you tell us a littlebit about you getting into Amazonwithout a CS major yeah I think um justgetting in as a liberal arts major maybe a bit disingenuous uh both of myparents were electrical engineers and soI've always had a computer around thehouse and um you know I used to programthat computer I still remember my firstone it was an uh IBM XT8088 with uh 640k of ram no hard disktwo five and two five and a qu uh two 5and a qu inch floppy discs so that it'sa floppy disc that's actually floppy notthe hard one that you you probably don'teven remember um and so you know I'veI've always been been coding and uhsince a really young age in high schoolI did the computer science uh AP testsmy sophomore year I did the ab testwhich was in Pascal way back when Pascalis a programming language and um myjunior year uh it was in C++ and I didthe BC test and so I knew about theconcepts of you know Big O um algorithmsand data structures how to writeprograms you know I still remembermaking like a Tetris clone when I was inhigh school so you know the fact that Ibroke in without a computer sciencedegree if you just said the part aboutthe English degree um like I said it's ait's a bit disingenuous and so I I wentto school I got a liberal arts degree Idid get a minor um in math and appliedmath and I took some computer sciencecourses you know when I when I got outof school II was looking for work and it was around2005 2006 I still remember this story Iwent and talked to my my writingProfessor uh in one of my senior yearseminars at udub and I was likeProfessor bossworth like what type ofjob should I get um I want to be awriter and he said he put his hand on myshoulder and he was like Steve there'sno job called writer it's it's like notnot yet there is a job called waiter andso you just have to find a way to sortof supportyourself um while you ply your craftright and so just finding some sort ofway to eek by while you get someexperience under your belt I wasn'treally turned on by that and so Idecided to to revisit the skills that Ipicked up in high school and before thatI see so I mean to me then it isdisingenuous to say that as if you camefrom zero skill but yourresume came from zero is myunderstanding right because if if youlook if I was a big tech recruiter and Iwas looking through stack of resumés andEnglish major comesalong you probably would not stand outwhen it comes to you know the the jobmarket so what is the thing that you didthat got you into Amazon it was throughnetworking so somebody that I did APComputer Science with work at Amazon hewent to University of Washington and gota proper computer science degree and wasa software developer at Amazon and sothey needed some support Engineers uhand it was a contract position and so Ibasically was like can you get me aninterview at the company and I was justI was not worried about a codinginterview because of my prior experiencebut also you know I think with supportengineers they writing scripts and andmaintaining systems and so I got throughon that interview and um you know I wasa green badge contractor for about ninemonths before I transitioned a fulltimewhat's green badge mean just temp yeahit's a temp I see it's an Amazon termyeah so the blue badge would befull-time and then green badge is acontractor yellow is like a vendor orgot it got it got it like maybe today'senvironment is like a bit more intensewhere people want to get into big TCHand you know Amazon's a big name at thispoint butalso your resume although it was not CSthe thing that got you in was that youknew someone and they gave you like a areferral and that made a big differencethat at least got you the the interviewand then you had the skills cuz you wereyou had been doing CS for a while yeah Ithink the way to think about it if youknow when I when I guide people tryingto get a job it takes two things ittakes you know some amount ofopportunity and it takes some amount ofstudyand so you don't know when theopportunity is going to pop up you don'tknow if your Uncle Daniel fromchurch you know will talk to somebodythat knows about a job opening you don'tknow when that's going to land it's veryunevenly distributed where theseopportunities come from but I think overtime they will come and and rear theirtheir heads or make themselves availableI think the other side of it is thepreparedness right so uplevelingyourself gaining knowledge gainingskills that needs to to occur you can'tjust have the opportunity and then nothave the skills right and so those twoneed things need to marry and so youknow I think back then it was much moredifficult to gain the knowledge that wasnecessary to to get into big Tech todayyou know you see all of these cottageindustries around interview prep gettingready for the coding interview none ofthat stuff existed when I was trying toget in and so I think it would actuallybe harder um back then to get your footinto the door in Tech from anon-traditional background than it istoday now I won't say that it'snecessarily easy today but at least inmy mind I think it was more difficultfor me yeah I remember when we worked onthat post together you said there wasn'teven the idea of like uh lists of leakcode questions and things and you werejust collecting interview questions toprepare yeah so when I was uh a supportengineer and I um you know they made meblue badge so full-time employee but Ijust I wanted to be an SD so bad and soall I did for the audience's softwaredevelopment engineer yeah and so Iwanted to be a software developer so badI just cornered everybody I just becamea collector of questions I was like whatdo you ask during interviews and I waslike don't tell me the answer I'm goingto go and figure it out and so you knowjust did it the oldfashioned way um justfiring up an IDE and you know you don'thave all these battery of test casesthey get run like you know with Le codeand stuff now and so you know generatingyour own test case you know that'sthat's a way to sort of uplevel yourselfso I feel like I did it in a just in atime where you know we weren't soresourcer so I imagine that probablylowered the average performance of a ofaninterviewee uh and maybe because you hadsomeextraordinary uh process of likecollecting questions that you might havebeen like you know very outstanding whenit comes to everyone because ultimatelyinterview prep is a little bitcompetitive you need to be better thanthe other people to to get in yes and noI I think of the distribution of demandfor software developers is skewed I justespecially today I don't think there's aton of demand for junior folks I thinkthere's a extraordinary amount of demandfor senior and above the reality is thatseniors come from mid-level and juniorsand so I think the pipeline is a bitbusted right now I don't necessarilythink of a ton of competition at theupper end um I do think that there is alot at the lower end um but thecompetition doesn't exist at theinterview stage I think the competitionexists at the pre-qualification andselection phase and so if you're able tocatch the attention of a recruiter sayyou know somebody that works at thecompany or you're able to go really deepin a particular area and and stand outmaybe you built an apphas some amount of customers that'swhere the competition is like you needto stand out on the selection side bythe time you get to the interview itlike it's just a matter of clearing thebar there and so you're the thedimension of competition is not at thecoding level I don't think why do youthink that most interview prep advice isgarbage I think that most interview prepisnon-optimal and soyou know there's a there's a hyperfocuson the codinginterview there's a hyperfocus now onsystemdesign but I think reallypeople forget they so they they turn itinto atest and in some sense it is if youcan't code then they they don't want youum if you can't design a system andyou're a senior like you know it's notgoing to work out like if we put you ina in a role it's it's just you're goingto be that 5% that leave right we don'twant to do that andso the the big overarching framework isthe people on the other side of thetable are trying to figure out whetherthey want to work with you whetheryou're going to be a good fit for theculture but people think about it interms of a test andso it's much more like a date than it islike at thesat right and but the but the the prepindustry the interview prepindustry it's much easier to think aboutit and present it as atest right and so I wish people wouldjust embed this uh you know some thingslike hey behavioral interviews have anoutsized impact on whether they're goingto hire you and what level you're goingto come in at so instead of say spending80% of your time oncoding or maybe let's say 60% on codingand then 35% on system design and likethe 5% is like the donate to charity pieslice like maybe it's much more like 40%40% 20% right because that behavioralside I think is really where the matchis made where and where behavioral isthe20% I was a bar Razer trainer and Itrained thousands of people at Amazon onhow to conduct interviews assess talentand then level people before thetraining was you know now it's a set ofvideos but it used to be live trainingso I've trained many people on this andwhat I used to say and I'll say it rightnow is the coding so the functionalparts of the interview the codinginterview the system design interviewthose things are the anti right sothey're the small blind and big blind soI use a poker analogy they're the smallblind and big blind of of getting into acompany andthe the behavioral part of theinterview that's the poker part of Pokerright that's like do you have a goodhand you know trying to beat the otherhand of the other person andso if you thought about the coding partand the system design part as necessarybut notsufficient like that's the that's thething that I wish peopleunderstood right we will say no topeople that have poor behavioralanswers poor not in the sense that theydon't have the experience it needs it'sjust we can recognize from far away thatit's not going to be a good fit for thecompany we'll say no to those peopleeven if their coding and system designis good you're saying at Amazon it'slike the functional part it's likecoding system that's like pass no passyes but once you pass it your levelingand the I guess the color behind how howgood you are is the behavioral yes I seeokay okay so then what what shouldpeople do to kind of um you prevent frombeing down leveled because theirbehavioral is bad I thinkthat they should spend some time on whatI callpackaging so if you can package yourexperience and sort of communicate thatpackaging to yourinterviewer I think that's just optimalfor both sides right so you arepackaging your experience you're you'recommunicating to them what you're allabout how you operate what things you'vedone in thepast and you can make that a good storyyou can not it doesn't have to beentertaining but it can be efficient andyou can you know if if you are able toeffectively articulate yourself andcommunicate it to yourinterviewer I think now we're talkingabout empathy now we're talking aboutthings like this is the fundamentalquestion for interviews is like do Iwant to work with this personthat's the question that this whole songand dance for the for the interviewprocess is trying to figure out do Iwant to work with this person ornot and and I think spending some timeon the behavioral side is about tryingto help the interviewer answer thatquestion so you are just you're reallytrying to act like yourself and and notyou know it's not NE you want to putyour best footforward you don't want to lie obviouslyyou want to misrepresent yourself but II really think that um you know justbeing able to talk about who you arewhat you're about and your experiencelike that's the important part that'sthe missing part from all of thisCottage like interview prep that's goingon on the internet that's the big thingthat's missing could you give me anexample of packaging like what maybe youcould package your as if you were goingto sell yourself back and go back toTech yeah you know so um just evensomething like tell me about yourselfright um I think people people kind ofgloss over that and they kind of run onsentence their way through it and youknow I think if I were to answer aquestion like that it would just be likehey you know my name is Steve fnn I haveyou know I have a a passion for backenddistributedsystems um I really love to work on umyou know customer facing products I'm asports fan you know I used to work atAmazon tickets and and Prime videosports and um you know I I really lovelike building teams and and really youknow taking an organization'sengineering culture and upleveling it atthat level like those are those are someof my passions right I didn't prep forthat that was kind of a interview offthe cuff but you know hopefully you gota sense of you know who I am and whatI'm aboutand the level that I operate one thingthat I like to say is that the storiesyou tell they they sort of betray yourlevel the way that you you youcommunicate with people they betray yourlevel right and so if you havestories that are sd1 stories right entrylevel stories but you're trying to get aseniorrole that that in congruity is the thingthat's going to lead to the downleveling yeah that makes sense and likethe last thing that you said there wasupleveling teams you're almost speakingto like a like a staff or higher rubricwhere you know it's not like you said ohI like to clean up the code or yeah Ilove refactoring code it's like I doyeah but that's not that's not how I'mgoing to describe myself yeah right andso I um trying to turn this into a videoof some sort but I just I want to do athing where I just talk with somebodyfor five minutes and I try to figure outwhether they're senior or mid or staffor whatever they are oh that'd beinteresting like a blind yeah yeah likeyou don't know and you just yeah andmaybe I'm you know maybe I'moverconfident but I just I feel like ifI talk to a junior entry-level person Iwould know that they're a junior entrylevel person they just they just justthe way that they carry themselves thethe things that they talk about you knowum now maybe on the you know if they'rea strong seniorengineer you know are they going to beable the pass as a principal yeahthere's some there's some places where Ium you know I might struggle but I Ithink I'm really calibrated in terms oflevel so that's for the interview stagewhat about before you get the interviewright now it's a really competitive jobmarket do you have any advice for peopleto stand out you have to be an outlierin some regard and so being an outlierMay mean oh I have a contact that cangive me a referral to a big tech companyI think that if you just if you C DMDsome folks on a team that had an openingand it was you know you didn't like spamthem it didn't look like a like a likean auto DM sort of thing or a script youdidn't sound like Ai and you were justlike hey my name's Ryan um I noticed youwork on this team and you have someopenings like can you tell me what it'slike on your team like what are the sortof things that you do on a day to-daybasis and then also you know I'm a I'm auniversity student I'm about to graduatein 3 months like how can I positionmyself optimally in order to get thisjob I I ran a poll on myDiscord and 90% of people said that ifsomebody did that and they were genuineabout it that they would interact withhim and that they would actually extenda referral if they asked right and sothat's a that's an easy way to be anoutlier in networking you know I I thinkabout a lot you know there's thisnetworking stuff where it's just likehey you know strengthen your yournetworking go up and talk to peoplethere's this and it's American style tooso it's like everybody thinks it's fakeand surface level but that's not whatI'm talking about right like you shoulddo those things but like really likenetworking is about making some sort ofconnection right and so if you're ableto connect with people they're in a spotto help you if you can provide value tothem right I think that's the that's oneway to be an outlier I think um ifyou're if you're new and you're you'rewilling to pick up skills hey what's theskill that I should pick up so that I'mmuch more attractive to to uh big Techor to to getting a job I think that mostpeople should go deep instead of goingbroad you know they'll be like Oh I'mgoing toyou know I'm doing a react tutorial andI'm going to learn rusts and thenthere's a machine learning python thingwith you know py toch and they go breathand there's no cohesion there it's likeyou know mobile app development andmachine learning yeah you can make themsort of you know connect to each otherbut at some sense it's contrived andthere's just so much to learn and so I Igive the general guidance it's just likeokay well what's the thing thatinterests you in a frame work or alanguage that you are you like youalready know like how deep can you go ina particular you know in a thing thatyou already have some familiarity with2025 is there a top programming languagethat you'd recommend for someone to godeep in the cheeky answer is English isthe top programming language in2025 um what what do you mean by thatyou know we had talked about it a littlebit before but the ability tocommunicate yourself the ability topackage your experience and tell a goodstory I think that's the thing that'sgoing that's the high leverage activityum in terms of languages you know dudeI've been I've been programming you knowI I've done assembly in basic and Pascaland c and C+ like I learned c c in 1990right like languagesare they come and they go like I I'm Iconsider myself a pearl expert like thatthat's no longer useful right and solike the language itself I think in asense is immaterial I think this iswhere I think you know your yourpersonal curiosity like it's totallyfine to pick up something that um youknow you have an affinity towards Ithink it's also totally fine to be likehey look at all of these jobs in Java Idon't think Java is going away or atleast jvm based languages and so I thinkit's totally okay to be like well I'mgoing to become an expert in Java that'snot very sexy right now but that's atotally fine reason so however you getthere my advice is just just go deepright people will be like okay cool wellI'm going to do a Java tutorial and thenI think an example of going deep is justbeing like Oh what's going on in thisvirtual machine what are virtualmachines right um what does it what doesit mean to tune a garbage collector andwe can get into a debate about whetheryou're going to shoot yourself in thefoot with you know trying to tweak yourjav a garbage collection but if you arewilling to pop the hood on that and thensort of like take a look at what's goingon in there that's a sort of thing thatnobody can stop you right like you canjust you can just try to go deep Stevesaid to go deep so I'm going as deep asI can till you get to the ones and thezeros that are flowing through on thatbus right like that is the thing that israre last thing on this topic of um youknow breaking in recently Zuck he hadthis uh quote he said on an interviewthat you know the capabilities of AI inthis year will be able to producemid-level engineer code um already doyou think that Junior Engineers are arescrewed then because of that I thinkit's super interesting maybe you shouldtell me you're the one that works atmeta right but I'll I'll say this Folksat the CEOlevel you know they can they're veryhigh performing their job is to lookinto the future but they tend to makepredictions thatare they're not exaggerated but theytend to they tend to make things likethe timeline for which things happenthey tend to undershoot that and then umthey tend to overshoot in ability butthe idea is that the vision exists andyou work towards it the fact that hesays he equivocates or at least he'shedging he he's saying mid-levelEngineers later this year if that wasactually already there he would havesaid senior staff level Engineers or 10xEngineers by tomorrow right the factthat he's pushing that out makes methink that the actual Implement like therollout of a mid-level AI bot withinmeta is a little it's a little furtheraway because his job is to move thegoalposts just a little further thanwhere we're at and so I so I have alittle bit of Doubt there now if youwant to talk about you know AI takingover some tasks yes absolutely theyshould you know I think when I wascoming up as a mid and Senior oh codegeneration look at these annotations wecan put lombok in our code you don'thave to write Getters and Setters umthere were there was you know I have alot of familiarity with Java Java is avery verbose language Oh look The IDEcan help me refactor some code the IDEcan write some boiler plate for me yesabsolutely we should be leveraging toolsto make us more efficient but at thispoint I think of uh AI help as anamplifier if you just go through thedifferent levels if you're a non- coderI think that you can go from zero to onevery easily right so we're getting tothe point with products like repet whereaSoup To Nuts from beginning to end umbut I have my doubts that if the appdoesn't work uh exactly the way thatit's intended um or they're like heyscale this thing to meta scale like I Idon't think an AI is going to be able todo that so I think very comfortablywe'll be able to go from zero to one butI don't think that it will go from likeone to many I think a 1xengineer is going to definitely turninto a 10x engineer today with the helpof a I but do I see a zero to 10xengineer jump like later this year I Idon't see it okay so then I guess movinginto you being at Amazon you went youwent into Amazon you converted to an SDand then you climbed all the way toprincipal uh at Amazon which I know thatlast jump is also very notoriouslydifficult so you went from sd1 to sd2sd3 and then principalum could you walk me through the thehigh level maybe just tell me you knowwhat was the main thing that made thedifference at each level and you knowjust like a very concise uh high levelyeah yeah I was able to get you know tofrom support engineer sd1 2 and threearound three three and a half yearssomething like that you know at sd1 Ithink it's the real focus is on someamount of Independence so justunderstanding where you fit fit insideof the software development life cyclegetting to the point where you can taketasks and see them all the way throughso you've gained a little bit of trustthere and you don't have to behandheld um I think that's the criticalpiece for um for junior level orsd1 um I think I just want to add acaveat there which is that doesn't meanyou know everything and that doesn'tmean that you don't ask questions it'sjust that you're much more comfortableasking a question if you're stuck you'remuch more comfortable surfacing an issuethere's some folks that have this ideathat at sd1 or or at any level that youare completely self-contained soself-contained is not the same thing asuh being independent well one of thecommon words that he for that firstpromo is like doing things independentlywithout guidance some people interpretthat as I'm not going to ask for helpand I got to do it all myself which isobviously not right but you need to knowhow to unblock yourself so makes senseand it's also Insidious in the sensethat it's it's not just not right sothat it will hold you back for longerbut it actually turns into a performanceissue if you're hiding the fact thatyou're you know not able to perform oryou don't know anything if you're hidingprogress because you're unsure aboutyourself and you sort of beat yourselfup that you should know this thing andyou know suppose you have a task and itshould take two weeks and then you'relike hey everything everything's ontrack everything's on track and then theThursday before you're like I've beenblocked this whole time that's aperformance issue right and so um youknow there's a there's a differencebetween oh it's just going to take youlonger to get there to something that'sactually detrial to get to the nextlevel um I think forsd2 the the word that pops into my headthe most is ownership and so you knowyou are an active participant in sdevelopment life cycle you're much moreof a steward of say your team'scodebase and I I just sort of thinkabout it like you know hey you'relittering don't Litter here like andthen maybe picking up some of the trashum that trash being Tech Deb not actualtrash in the code you know being able toget you know you're now you're able toleverage this Independence and to startto make a contribution to the team'scode base that's a little bit largerright so basically every step up withsde is kind of an argument that youdeserve more scope and so the the scopeof an sd2 or mid-level engineeris you know at the team level right youunderstand your team's code base youknow you understand its weaknesses itsstrengths you can start to you know makesuggestions about where it's going to beat Amazon we have an operational cultureand so you know you you're on call youknow how things break you might havesome ideas about how to fix some ofthese things and so I you know it's it'sa very you know meat and potato sort ofrole and you know this this is what youneed to go from two to three yeah I'mjust talking about two oh this is tableStakes for yeah I think it'sexpectations for at least this is myconception of it right M and there's aneternal debate at Amazon about whetherthe sd2 or mid-level role is a terminalposition or not can you retire as an sd2the level granularity at Amazon is suchthat I think S2 is a very wide band so Ithink at the upper levels of S2 a lot ofthose folks are senior engineers atother companies um even within big Technot just you know oh they a seniorengineer um at a a smaller company or astartup I think they're you're you'repretty strong um as an sd2 at Amazonjust because the granularity for levelsat Amazon is soterrible and um so I I tend to to biastowards like yeah actually atsd2 you're uh that could be a terminallevel right now I don't advise thatpeople think of it as a terminal levelbut it's just a reflection of you knowhow much scope I think an sd2 at Amazoncan can actually deliver against sothere isn't an up and out policy like ifyou were a manager at Amazon and you hadsomeone that says Hey I want to juststay at at you knowsd2 um is that okay or would they getfired in Amazon's culture eventually soand it might have changed you know it'sbeen it's been close to a year sinceI've been gone so I say we a lot asthough I still work there I'm stilltrying to train myself I don't work atAmazon yeah um so uh it's definitely upand out at sd1 yeah and so if you'vebeen at sd1 for more than 2 years youknow it's it's kind of like H this is isthere formal formal like you know 24months and then they start managing outor it's a feel thing I believe it's ait's a strong it's a progressivelystronger Guidance the longer that you'vebeen there but it's not a 20 36 monthsand then you're out sort of thing yeahyeah um I think for sd2 it's a much moreinteresting conversation I think thatwill depend onthe where the upper management you knowfor that particular individual wherethey land on whether S2 is a terminallevel or not MH um and so if you happento get a manager that's basically likeno you've been there for 10 years youshould be a three um if you happen to toget that person um then I I think itmight be might be bad news for you andyou know with the recent news about metaa lot of people are likening or they'reworried that meta would turn into Amazonbecause Amazon's famous for a culture ofintense performance and cutting peoplewho aren't making it um from yeah fromyour time at Amazon I'm kind of curiousmaybe you can give us the the the juicydetails like how many people areexpected to be cut in Amazon typicallylike cuz you were there for so manyyears is it you know some percentage peryear or is it a to the manager'sdiscretion how does that work what I cansay so I won't give an exact number uhwhat I can say is that guidance you knowsuppose it was five or 6% you know foran organization that number used to be arecommendation it would it would be kindof a soft one hey we need to manage outx% of folks over the course of a year umI think in the past couple of years thathas turned into a muchmore um it's turned from guidance tomuch more of a mandate I think coupledwith the fact that up until recentlythey weren't doing backfills for folksthere was this sort of like hey keep onrunning cuz this thing's chasing youright from the back yeah I don't thinkthat was necessarily healthy yeah andyou know if I were to be quite honest II consider myself a high performer andso if you're a high performer you don'thave to think about that stuff and youknow as much as I'd like to beempathetic about about it and you knowI've been around some of these decisionsand meetings and stuff like that um ifyou're down it's I it's hard for me toto speak about what it's actually liketo to to feel like your job may be atstake right and so you know I I think alot of what I would tell you is is justkind of cold and numbers based there arereal people here right if you you knowgetting fired from a job isyou know that's a that's a very that's ahighly emotional psychological thingright so I just want to make sure that II I bring that up maybe I'll say thisand this is this is sort of how I Iguided other folks and other managerswhen they're asking me hey how do I howdo I think about this the way to thinkabout itis 5% suppose that was the number rightso that's one in 20people right and so just just take apopulation of 20 peopleand I think there's a distribution thereand the people on the left hand side ofthatdistribution in regular years wherethere are backfills I thinkthat I think that they're not they'renot having a good time with Amazon'sculture right they're not thrivingalmost by definition right we're justgoing to say hey everything on theleft-and side is um people aren't aren'thaving a great time and so I think it'salmost a relief that there's a way tosort of like leave a situation like thatwhat's what's thealternative theystay and somebody that's not having agreat time in Amazon's culture which youknow it's it's it doesn't have a greatreputation part of me is like oh that'skind of nice that you know um it's kindof a blessing indisguise right that we would move themout now without backfills that's where Istart to get a littleuncomfortable because in BAS basicallyany other year that they would be atAmazon they would be totally fine and Ithink even people you know that are sortof left shifted but in that main part ofthe distribution I think they're greatum so that's where I start to go likethis is not this is not something thatum I really agree with you're sayingbecause it starts to cannibalize peoplewho are they're doing good but now we'reforced to yeah stack ring people thatwere good so suppose you had a 6% amountof folks that were let go and that was ahard thing and so you did all of thevery tough work to identify those folksand have them move out and now you needto do 6% of those folks that remain andthen you need to do 6% of those folksthat remain and so I it's not 18% youknow I don't I can't do that math butnow we're starting to talk talk aboutpeople that are very close to the midpoint they're operating at a high leveland in any other year they'd be totallyfine um but now they're not and so youknow I I I have colleagues that were letgo recently and he just kind of blows mymind that they would be they would belet go and so I think the most amount ofimpact will come from folks that um saymiddlemanagement where okay okay well there'sfour middle managers within the suborright here the bottom 6% like 6% doesn'teven make sense when you're talkingabout four people or eight people rightand so I I was very surprised by some ofthe people that were let go recently soyou said when in the past I guess as aprincipal engineer once you get higherup you were privy to some of theconversations where people are beingdiscussed if they're getting managed outwhat what happens in those conversationshow does a high level IC like youparticipate yeah you start gettingpulled in when you're a senior engineerand you definitely get pulled in whenyou're L7 or above those meetings areterrible right um they're like threedays long and you're locked up in a roomand you're just sitting there talkingabout people and people you start tolose the humanity you just start tothink of them in terms of you know themeasurables right and and the feedbackfrom other folks um I won't go into thespecific processum but what I will sayis it's not a linearalgorithm um I think in a in a perfectworld you would just go througheverybody in the org and then you wouldyou would have equal amount of time totalk about them and their strengths andtheirweaknesses typically you just talk aboutthe edges um and that's not a reflectionof you know the people that are makingthe decisions and whether that's poor ornot it's just it's the math there arejust too many peopleand so the the conversation tends to goto either side andum yeah it's it's just it's not myfavorite time of year yeah no definitelyit sounds intense especially if they cutout some low performers and then thenext iteration is like people where youobjectively look at them go oh they'reyeah they're solid but you need to Forkover some more people now if you want totalk about meta I think meta is on ahiring spree if I'm if I'm not mistakenthink you know if uh if your fearlessleader is saying Hey low performers areleaving and it's say at a 5% number Ithink that's the number that's beenfloated aroundum I I just have a sense that thosefolks are probably not having a goodtime at meta rightnow right um do that everybody no but Iwould say the the vast majority of folksthere um if you're talking about one in20 people 20 random people at meta therethere's probably somebody that'sstruggling especially when you startmultiplying that out across a largepopulation so because the inflow is muchlarger than the outflow I wouldn't betoo worried sounds like across big Techthere's this increased intensity and uhhistorically Amazon has been the onethat's always had this level ofincreased intensity or at least thisthis process of like let's manage outthe low performers quickly and let'slet's just factor that into ourprocesses given that you've been in alot of those performance conversationsdo you have any advice for the peoplewho are on the border where you know ifthis is a how we're going to beoperating in the future people who arekind of just meeting expectations whatis the things that protects you uh inthoseconversations um that they could do forthis coming year to to be safe I thinkit's just that if you meet expectationsif you solidly meet expectations ifeverybody across the organization metexpectations I don't think you have a 5%stack ranking like removing folks fromthesystem right and so you know I I don'tthink that people that are and I bristlea bit at the low performerlabel I just I just again I think of itas like the culture is not working outthere is a mismatch between me and theambient environment at any particularcompany I don't think it's a low performyou know how hard it is to get a anoffer atmeta like you are not a um low performeryeah right you you have to be driventhere is a song and dance that you needto that you need to perform underpressure in front of somebody like yougo and take a Le code hard and you haveto go look at some you know you have tocoat it in front of some SD that's likegot a bad expression on their face likeyou are more than qualified yoursmart as hell and now you're working ata companyand maybe you thought it was somethingdifferent than what it actually was whatI would say is I don't think these lowperformers these so-called lowperformers they should try to becomeHighperformers right Ithink by focusing on trying to be a highperformer or focusing on trying to getto the nextlevel there's usually a reason whyyou're considered you're labeled thatway and so try to figure out what isthat Dimension that you're being judgedand measured against that's that'sholding you back from meetingexpectations so I think you need tocrawl before you walk before you runwhat is that thing that they're judgingyou on and then I think you should bereal with your manager and you shouldsay hey I just wanted to check in am Imeeting expectations and if I'mnot then like let's let's do apreemptive plan right so pip stands forperformance Improvement plan can you doa pre tip can you can you proactivelyput together a plan to get you to a spotwhere you're going to be safe that'swhat I would that's what I wouldrecommend just be proactive about growthto get back to the median asking yourmanager for a proactive pip is I wouldmaybe not use those words that'shilarious um okay so it sounds like Imean obviously meet expectations workwith your manager well I don't thinkit's obvious I don't I actually if youif you took a Surof software developers and you askedthem have you used these words with yourmanager suppose you're my manager yeahhey Ryan um you know I just started hereat meta um I just wanted to get a senseof what my your expectations of me whatare those right have they have youexplicitly asked about expectations withyour manager I think like 25% of ofpeople have actually done that I thinkmost people are trying to guessat what those expectations are and so Ithink that would be my first bit ofadvice is just like straight up ask whatexpectations are and then ask if you'remeeting them or not right that would goso far definitely yeah that makes a lotof sense I think most people all right Idon't know if it's um being shy or orwhat but feel like most ic's don'tdirectly talk to their manager and say Iwant this or you know how do I meetexpectations how do I get promotedkind of just do the work and do it welland hope that things go go well wellobviously there's going to be an answeryeah and so it's like hey Ryan Ryanwhat's your expectation of me and am Imeeting it it's like no Steve you arenot meeting expectations and um it'sstarting to become a problem even thatis a better situation than not knowingoh yeah for sure right and so um there'sa mutual friend of ours Rahul Pandy fromTero yeah yeah I stole this saying fromhim and I don't know if he stole it fromsomebody else that worked at meta butit's basically like um bad news that'sdelivered early is justnews right right bad news that'sdelivered late is terrible news yeah sothe the you know so if you are askingabout expectations and it's early inyour career it's early in cycle you knowand they're like hey this is a problemwell now you've surfaced the issueand you have a like you have a FightingChance of actually addressing it if youare like hey what's up with myexpectations oh it's really bad and it'sDecember right so the month's precedingperformance review you're not in a goodspot yeah right and so I I justencourage people to deliver or try tofind as much bad news as early aspossible for your principal promo Ithink a lot of it comes down tohaving the opportunity and thendelivering but I it's it's interestingto dig into how you got the opportunityto even deliver on principal scope sokind of curious can you tell the storyabout how you got that so I was reorgback into Prime video and so theprevious team to that was a team that Icared deeply about it was called Amazontickets we sold tickets like TicketMaster Built a bunch of really awesomeTech um a ton ofpatents um I love music I love going tolive shows and so I was like oh this isgreat they spun that business down andthey reorg that whole team into Primevideoo andum basically the 30 or 40 devs that werein thatorganization they kind of just scatteredinto the wind right and um I was I had abad taste in my MTH and so I was and Ididn't want to talk to any of their teamso I was basically like okay well whatdo I have here what what they had was aa team that was focused on deliveringlive sports on the Prime videoplatform and uh I'm a big sports fan aswell and so I was like okay well this isinteresting and then I looked around Iwas like oh there's a bunch of principalEngineers here okay so cool I can I canlearn about what's going on there and umthere is this really big need that wasthere um just the the catalog workand you know I I just made a decisionabout whether I wanted to pick it up ornot right um and I decided to it wasjust in reality much larger than anyother project that I had ever done Iwouldn't say it would it landed on mylap I it was a combination of stayingand then sort of saying okay well if Istay I need to do this I see so it'ssome scope thatprincipal Engineers were aware of neededto be done was particularly difficult itwas it was just sitting there forsomeone to take it on yeah you took theinitiative say all right I'm going totake it and stay on this team and thenyou delivered on it yeah it's you knowthe way that the principles wereorganized back then it's changed now butessentially the principles were assignedto different areas say like playback orclients or catalog or wherever they wereand the work that needs to be donewas in the gaps between those or so ithad to be an end to-endsolution and so even though the the thethrust the main thrust of the work wasin these sort of centralized servicesandso that's why you know nobody none ofthe other principles had done it becausethey were kind of they were doing all ofthis other stuff that was necessary forus to deliver okay so that that makes alot sense too cuz I imagine also if youdelivered on that so each principal toeach um I guess Central vertical andyou're delivering some glue work um ifyou did that job really well not only isthe scope huge but also these principalEngineers are you know they're going tohave context on your work and speak toyour packet and be champions for you soI'm sure that was helpful too A lot ofpeople they say getting to principleAmazon is so difficult people don't evenrecommend doing it you know there's allthis job hop adviceso what is the thing that usually blockspeople from going from senior toprincipal at Amazon there's a lot ofreasons um Ithink just to back up a little bit I amof the impression that Amazon justskipped a level so they should justinsert a staff level uh stafflevel they could do that right nowbasically they would say okay welleverybody that's principal will'll callyou principls shove staff in there andthen just say hey for you know for thereally high performing S3s we're justgoing to move you there preemptively andthat would be so great but I think thebig problem is that you're essentiallyjumping two levels uh for thatparticular promotion andso the the big thing that's holding themback is that you need to jump two levelsright so there's there's basicallydouble the amount of criteria to get tothat next level and I think it's kind ofimpossible to um exhibit all of themoving to criteria for principal in ayear so if you think you're ready heyI'm a senior engineer I've been doingreally well I'm going to make a bigpush I think it's like it's it's becausethe job is so different because nowyou're influencing multipleteams it's very difficult to find theopportunity and then also be able toperform at a level where people wouldconsider you the next level 12 18 monthsand so what ends up happening for youknow the the failure mode that I see themost is they think they're ready theywill make a push they will get arejection and they will get some amountoffeedbackand then what they'll do is they'll youknow they'll just go back to theirstrengths and then they'll continue towork on their they might like addressone or two of these pieces of feedbackbut it just takes so long to um to closeone of thesecycles and so a lot of people give up II know so many folks that you know wentto meta and they're they're thri or theywent to Google absolutely thriving rightnow senior staffE8 you know principal at Google which isyou know two levels past staff and uh inand one level above senior staff they'redoing awesome they just couldn't makethat jump right from sd3 to principaland so it it turns into this thing whereI think there's this 2-year slidingwindow of where you kind of have to packin basically a new job you have tobasically be doing two jobs becausethere's a there's an anti- pattern whereyou just stop doing all the things thatyou need to do for sd3 and you justfocus on the principal level stuff andthen performance review time comesaround and then they're like uh you'reactually low performance at sd3 eventhough you're a high performer doingprincipal level things H how's thatpossible like what are those two jobsand how are they so different well thereason it's possible is because umperformance and promotion are decoupledtwo different processes what's theperformance process at Amazonperformance process is you know uhyearly and then you know every sixmonths there's a smaller version of thatand then the promotion process isdepends on the level so it could bequarterly or it could be every sixmonths so they might line up generallybut the idea is that there's not adependency on one with the other and soif you're trying to make a big push fora promotion and you're doing all thisprincipal stuff and then you know thenit's so here's here's a big examplesenior Engineers need to code rightthat's a that's a very important thingthat theydo and um principles are also expectedto code but not as large of acontribution generally like Directcontribu ution is not rare but it justthat needs to be balanced with theirother obligations so they might be asponsor of a project or they might beacting as a back stop or they might beacting as a catalyst or an evangelistfor a particularinitiative and so you know thoseroles they are pan team right so it'sit's cross functional teams there mightbe product teams there might be five Devteams these Dev teamsmaybe spanning multiple organizationsyou might act like a TPM I was accusedof that in one of my um promotionassessments uh it's kind of hard tofigure out whether Steve's an SD or aTPM kind of took offense to that I'mlike are are you kidding me dude and andyou know one of them came back like heyyou need to code more and I'm like Ihave checked in so many lines of codeand so okay well I there's some sporadicyou know six months where I didn't codea lot it's like I didn't get any creditfor time served I see okay so theylooked at the code delivered in thosesix months when you're going forprincipal they looked at it not a lot ofcode and so they said okay we'reblocking you because you're not doingthe senior job yeah but principal wasgood because you were doing all thecross functional yeah and so then it gotkicked so then it's like okay well nowI'll go code right and they'll be likeoh it's been you know it's been a longtime since he's been on call he's not onthe day-to-day operations for anindividual team it's like I've been youknow I I was there for 18 years I havebeen oncall longer than Pro like time on calllonger than most people's careers atAmazon by far I've probably been on calllike four years continuously yeah and soyou get feedback like that and you'rejust like this like I'm battling theprocess now right and so to to be quitehonest I was promoted in2020 um and I thought I was ready at2016 so you know I I was promoted tosenior in 2012 so it took 8 years to getthere I thought I was there in 2016 andfour years and you went for promo everyyear and they gave you like this TPMfeedback or other yeah there was therewere a number of obstacles but you knowthey changed the process three timesduring that four year span um I I justto be honest I probably hadn't generatedevidence that I was operating at thatlevel that's not to say that I didn'thave the ability but you need togenerate this tangible evidence thatgoes into your packet so I wasn't quitethere yet you need the support of yourmanager and so there was a there was anumber of reasons why I wasn't able toget there um but a lot of it was justbattling the process itself I don'tthink I necessarily up leveled myself Ithink I just became an expert in theprocess of getting promoted and so whatdid you learn from becoming an expert ofthat promo process for senior 2 yeah Iyou know I I think about it and like isthat a useful skill yeah I think so Ithink it's useful for people that are inAmazon I learned a couple of things sothe big ones are don't wait to start Ithink a lot of people postponethemselves and so they're like oh wellafter this big projectlands that's when I'll get my packettogether but the project Landing may notbe the thing that that you would berejected for and so I'm a big proponentof being kind of impatient and puttingyour packet in early and then gettingthat actual feedback about where thegaps are so that's one failure pattern Ithink the other is youknow you do get some amount of creditfor strengths in your promo packet andso suppose your strengths are you knowhe's a greatcommunicator um very data driven he doesa lot of you know he's a Str there's astrength withinterviewing um great coder cool uhfeedback oh well he's not scalingthrough others uh he could be a betterMentor um he doesn't communicate upwardvery well to directors orVPS um so let's work on that you don'treally have to put so much emphasis onthe strengths just make sure that theydon't regress and turn into problems butI think you can just focus on the deltabecause that's what the promo panel isgoing to do when you're you know we tryto make the the promo packet sticky to aparticular set of individuals and soit's like okay well Ryan you knowrejected you get the big red Stamperthing on a piece of paper and you knowsix months later it's like oh Ryan he'snot promoted yet okay like let's dig inagain with humans just like the talentreviewprocess you're you're going to look atthe Delta you're going to look at theoutliers right and so you're going to belike okay well what changed right andjust like let's look at the like theevidence that's there and so if you'reable to really focus in on the the areasfor growth the places where there aren'tas many data points then uh I thinkyou'll be pretty successful when you getthat packet back you're saying there'sthe strengths and then there's thingsthat blocked it and you're sayingstrengths they're good don't you don'tneed to worry about those just focus onon the weaknesses and closing those gapsI would just say prioritize theweaknesses and gaps and you just I thinkabout it like uh you're in a kitchenwith a lot of pots and pans everywhereit's like your strengths you can putthat on the back burner mhh right but umyou know this uh this risoto like you'regoing to sit here and make sure that therisoto is good right it's like it's likeyou're adding broth you you just can'tyou have to make sure that you got thatright and so you said you were at Amazonfor 18 years their Amazon's culture isvery specific they have the leadershipprinciples it's its own yeah culturewhat's your favorite parts of Amazonculture and then we'll also talk aboutthe worst Parts too the worst Parts isit you know I think there's some amountof Stockholm syndrome for me being therefor so long I'm drinking the Kool-Aidyou know I still say I we even thoughit's been a while since I work what'syour favorite Kool-Aid then well I justthe big thing is uh customer obsessionoh yeah I I think especially when Bezoswas thereum nobody ever gave uh lip service tothe customer experience that was thehighestpriority from interns toVPS you were always going to be doingthe right thing if you had the customerin mind absolutely100% um and I just I think that's agreat NorthStar and so you know I think if youchase profits or you focus oncompetitors or you know there's a lot ofother trappings that are there you mightoptimize for the wrong thing right ifyou optimize for shortterm next quarterprofits it's going to bite you in thelong run um if you optimize for you knowif you're just sort of chasing that'sanother problem right and so if you ifyou actually work backward from thecustomer you know Jeff Bezos has thatsaying they're like hey long-termprofits and and customers those are thesame thing there's no difference there Ithink that's wonderful another thingthat Iabsolutely I think is a superpower forAmazon is their writing culture you knowI think um the ability to write asix-page doc that was that wasaccelerated by the fact that I have awriting degree and so I didn't realizethat I had the precursor to asuperpower um when I joined I I wasworried about like learning Java rightor or learning how to to deploy toman I wish people would have a collegeclass to figure out how to like send anemail or to be clear about like the workthat's in front of them and so whatcomes with a a wonderful writing cultureis a wonderful reading culture like weliterally will spend the first 30minutes of a meeting reading thedocument and then we will have adiscussion afterwards there's no thisnever works it's like oh I sent you thedocumentso after you've read the document we'reall going to get in the no nobody doesthat right like they should it's like abest intention sort of thing right butthe fact that you're forced to read itat the same time and everybody's justsort of fast forwarded to the same placeand then you can have a discussion likethat's actually super powerful so ifsomeone was on boarding to Amazon theyreally want to make sure they hit theground running and plug into theculture would you say that's one of themost important things yeah if if they ifthey are curious about how we know we'redoing right by thecustomer yeah I think that's a you ifyou have a curiosity about that you willdo you will do really well um thewriting culture I think that's just themedium by which we express our ideasthat'slearnable um that's something that Iwouldn't necessarily focus on before youjoined you said you're drinking theKool-Aid but there's got to be somethingthat you don't like about Amazon culturewhat would be the number one thinguh I know mine what's that I rememberthis was uh this was like a joke amongmy friends and I Amazon I there's theleadership principles right and you knowthere a list of what 11 or 12 thingsthat yeah everyone's kind of basingeverything off of and there's one therethat was just like the recurring insidejoke among our friend group which wasfrugality basically anything anytimesomething was crappy or cheap orwhatever we would just say oh frugalityso you know no free food no uh there wassome other things too like a hardwarewasn't particularly good or yeah youknow I think free food that's aperk if if a company doesn't provide youfood like that doesn't mean it's a badcompany so it's it's it's great on theupside but I don't think there's it saysvery much on the other side I do thinkthink you know frugality uh we we have aterm called being Frid where you areright so Frugal that it's kind of stupidI had to beg borrow and plead forHardware right like I'm I'm trying toget a trying to get a MacBook Pro withlike some Ram so that it doesn't likelike the fan doesn't overheat when I'mrunning like building my code it'slike if you're going to hire you knowtens of thousands of software developersyou won't like get them a computer thatwork now I'm not saying like I need thetop-of-the-line thing I just I just needa computer I'm a software developer giveme a you know give me a computer thatworks you know when intern season wouldcome and then the interns would leaveand then the vultures would come to tryto steal themonitors right and so it's just like youknow it just it just reminds me of likeOliver Twist like you know it's likemore please it's like you just want alittle bit moreGRL yeah one thing that I wanted to diginto uh and I guess this is switching toanother topic is in your time at Amazonyou had 17 managers over 18years so you've seen a lot when it comesto managers what was it that made yourbest manager the best manager out of 17I think I had more than 17 managersactually really yeah okay than it was inthe 20s last time I checked I took ascreenshot of my phone tool you know Ithink a lot about this you know uhsometimes people would complain about amicromanager but there's a class of offolks that kind of like a micromanagerlike they they kind of need to be ledthey kind of need things broken down forthem I do think that a lot of what makesa good manager is personal the ones thatI resonated with um they tended to beprinciples based right so not just theleadership principle stuff but like theway that they operated um they sort ofreasoned through you think of theseprinciples asaxioms and um you know so you fixcertain things and and those things haveimplications and so the best managers Ithink they fixed customer Obsession theyfixed uh things that I value like sortof thinking ahead in the future so theywere maybe willing to entertain some youknow some stuff that in the short termlike a hack but it was always within thecontext of like what should we do what'sthe right thing to do in the future okayso like let's made a tradeoff for thatinstead of you know maybe some managersthat I didn't like are folks that aremaybe too delivery oriented right soit's just a constant Death March it'sabout delivery it's about near-termdelivery um so folks that kind ofthought a little bit ahead in the futureand um were maybe not so constrained bywhat we had in front of us I see andthen what about the worst manager youhad out of 20 something managers yeah Idon't want to name names or anything butum you know sometimes I think about howdid we gethere right and so like we live in a in amoment right now and so I'm talking toyou and so I I I can see it you know ayear ago he was here and a year beforethat he was here and I I can kind of seethe progression of how you get from youknow maybe a university student atUCLA to where you are right now likethat aggression makes sense I think somepeople that I worked with you're likehow did you gethere like it's it's sort of like theSilicon Valley thing I forget the nameof the guy that uh bigh head yeah yeahit had to have been some sort of bigheadscenario where you know he fell up rightluck happened and everything just sortof landed in their lap so you know um Ithink the worst managers I had would becombination of like not my style rightso again you know micromanager oneperson is a really caring and engagedmanager to another person and then umjust a little bit of like WTF like howdid you get here I thought that thewhole performance and promotion processand the hiring process was supposed tofilter a certain set of folks out andhere we are at the end of each interviewI like to go over just generalreflections of people um kind of lookingover the career what are the things thatyou learned and and various other thingsum one thing that I'm curious aboutbecause you were at Amazon for 18 yearsand in this industry that isextraordinary people already call mefossil for being at meta for greaterthan four or five years so you know whatkept you at Amazon so long I think thatyou know we had talked about the numberof managers that I had reportedto umI had many careers many many careers atAmazon right so I worked on the firstKindle and I worked on the precursor toPrime video before I went back to Primevideo I and I worked on in payments soyou know I think the fact that Amazondoes so many different things um hasallowed me to work on a variety ofdifferent things you know and didn'tfeel like I've been on one team it's notlike I worked in the accountingdepartment for 25 years and they handedme a gold watch right um and so you knowthere's a there's a VP I think he'sstill a VP at in advertising Paul cotushe he told me one day he said I've neverswitchedteams wow right like Amazon just kind ofyou know refactored itself around himuntil he was BP of ads right and sogreat guy and so um you know I don'tthink it's gets to that extreme but umyou know I had a wide variety ofexperiences there and so it does itdoesn't feel like one 18-year contiguoussort of experience so it sounds like youwere still challenged learning I thinkwhen I was at Amazon for my shortstunt it was difficult for me to nothave wandering eyes because there werethese other hot companies recruiterswere messaging me and you know I wasjust seeing that oh maybe I can get moresomewhere elseum did did you ever consider leavingAmazon yeah yeah absolutely I thinkum you know especially early career itmakes a lot of sense to jumpcompanies uh you know everybody hearsthe the common advice it's like hey youwant to maximize your total comp youshould be job hopping I think that worksuntil you get to the equivalent ofsenior after that I think you knowyou're an outlier here but I think afterthat it makes sense to put Roots downright the the levels that at the highestlevels I I don't think you're going tofind a lot of distinguished Engineers orprincipal Engineers or staff seniorstaff Engineers that haven't been on theteam like the like the jump the thingthat got them to that level I think youwhat you'll find is that you know therethere was like five years you know atleast like at least three but more likefive or so where they really stayed onthe same team on the same problem rightright and so you know I think if youwant to min max it what I would say isyou know job hop every two years tillyou get to to Mid maybe a little bitbefore and then go to um you know andthen try to put Roots down if you wantto become a highle tech IC for me Ithink that because I was able to to goto different teams and you know becauseI don't have that computer sciencebackground I think staying put made aton of sense because I feel like Ididn't there was so much to learn rightyou know there was so many there was somuch code that you had access to therewere all of these wikis you know theseinternal videos and so I felt like Icould still grow in the ways that Iwanted to by staying at Amazon Iremember even when I was at Amazon thestock was climbing like crazy did youhave any years where you were just superovercome ated and if so how much wereyou making in that year so here's thethingI I would uh you know I I was basicallydivesting and then you know puttingmoney into otherInvestments and I won't say that Imissed a lot of like the Amazon's climbbecause a lot of it was was sort ofunvested rightum I don't know I think uh 2020 orsomething like that I probably got likean extra 350k that I didn'tdeserve you know just from from themarket returns and and extra rsus thatwere given to me um when I left so 2024I you know if on the on the vestingschedule that I was on I would have made750k which is not a lot compared to likethe upper end of the salary ranges butquite a bit just sort of objectively asa number to make in the US at this pointin time I decided around I think 2018 or2019 to to maybe like not divest myAmazon shares cuz it was always likeyou're dumb like you shouldn't put allof your eggs in one basket but everytime I sold stock just if you just lookat the stock price it was just it wasjust the wrong move right and so I waslike I'm done I'm done I'm not going tokeep every single little bit but um I'mgoing to keep some and so that turnedout to be okay you said extra Equity diddoes Amazon have a uh for highperformers uh like a discretionaryEquity or additional Equity um not thatI know of I think um I compensation islargely you're talking about likeRefreshers then yeah yeah it's at thediscretion of managers and so you knowone of my one of my best managers he wasbasicallylike YOLO YOLO he was like I'm out andso so he hooked me up you know and andleft me go but it's not like theseinsane like million-dollar things that Iever got how how big of a difference tothat it was that 350 Delta oh I see Isee just like that was over four yearsor no it was it was just sort of all atonce it just here's350 okay that's pretty good yeah yeah itwas it was the equivalent of that he washe was basically on his way out and hehe gave it to me and then he left andthen that appreciated essentially thenext year like immediately so oh that'samazing it wasn't it wasn't like here'she didn't write me a check it was just acombination of the um of sort of gettingan outsized um performance bonus and andthe stock price just doing really wellokay so over the course of your career18 years at Amazon one thing that I'mcurious is what was your biggest regretum yeah certain teams I think just justreading the the the writing on the walland making a sober decision aboutwhether to stay or whether to leave Ithink there was a lot of inertia I thinkyour default mode is to just stay putfor some amount of time and I don't knowif that's useful the uh I guess thecareer regret is noticing when you're ina bad situation or a bad team and justtaking the initiative to change thatsituation just leave the regret is justdid you make it a decision or not didyou take in all of the considerationsand then said said okay I am going tocontinue to stay it's the deferral of adecision and so the default becomes juststaying put that's the regret it's justlike just turn it into an explicitdecision and the last question I like toask and I ask everyone this question isif you could go back to you or you justgraduated college you're right about toenter the industry you could tellyourself something what would be thething that you want to tell yourself umI think Ithink maybe saying somethingaround people pleasing right um you knowin the the culture that I was raised inand you know there are these tracks thatyou get on and it's like okay we'll dowell in school and then go get a job andthen go get married and like you knowyou have this feeling ofbeing ahead or behind right so thatrelativecomparison um but then also after you doa thing after you make some sort ofachievement you're kind of looking forto someone else forvalidation andum I don't know if my younger self wouldhave like listened to be quite honestwith you but you know just if I couldsomehow learn this lesson that like theperson that you really need to please isyourselflike just just being like are is are youdoing what you want to do or are youdoing it because that's the expectationof somebody else are you climbing theladder because you want to get to thetop or are you climbing a ladder becausethe ladder was put in front of you justexamining that um that makes sense coolwell thanks so much for your time SteveI really enjoyed the conversation and uhyeah I guess now would be the time if weif you want to shout out anything thatyou're working on um I have my uhYouTube channel it's called a lifeengineered um so go and subscribe tothat I have a Weekly Newsletter um thatgets sent out so you know it takes along time to make a YouTube video and soyou know if you want more from me thenewsletters there and then if you wantto chat um just join my Discord awesomecool all right well thanks so much foryour time Steve really appreciate itabsolutely",

    "transcript": "so we know indexing makes your databasefaster in this video we'll go throughhow exactly indexing makes your databasefaster we'll go through howindexes help you minimize the disk iosthat needs to be done by constructing avery simple index basic mathematics tojust understand what happens behind thesceneso let's jump into ita database to be very simply put is justa collection of records like now if it'sa sequel thing it could bethe collection of rows grouped intotables if it's let's say mongodb or anydocument based database it would be likea collection of json documents but theidea is all of those documentsneeds to be storedin this so needs to be serialized andthen stored onto the disk right so howdoes that serialization happen so inthis one we'll take an example of a verysimpleuhaa very simple sequential serializationlike here like what we typically seewith sql databases right so let's takean example of sql database will not godive will not go deeper into b plus treeand we'll see how it fits into thescheme of things but just a basicunderstanding of how indexes workso let's say we have a users table andit has five columns id name h bio andtotal blockssoeverycolumn or every attribute over here willtake up some space onto the disk whichmeans that when that attribute or whenthis row needs to be serialized everyattribute gets itsparticular size or its particular set ofbytes stored onto the diskrightso here id being an integer let's say ittakes up four bytesnameiput it as 60 bytes age again an integersof 4 bytes bio could be a big onelet's say we put it as 128 bytes andtotal number of blocks as in how manyblockshas this user published would be aninteger so four bytes so in allwhen i am trying to store one row ontothe disk it would take up 200 bytes tostore one disk uh to store oneuhrow okay so here we saw user table fivecolumns 200 bytes to store one row ontothe disk now let's say my table my userstable has 100 rows like this so whatwould be the total size of this table200 for each row100 rows like this so 20 000 sobasically 20 000 bytes is what willrequire so it would look something likethis let's say these are like dummyentries in my table1 name is aage is 23 some bio and then total numberof blocks 7id 2 name is b age is 21bio something something something totalblocks is 10 and so on and so forthright so let's say we are playing withthis six entries and there are many moreentries like thistotaling up to 100 rows rightnow let's go through and understand howdisk howreads from the disk actually happenso wherever anything is being read fromthe disk like even if you read one bytefrom the disk it's not that only thatbyte is red it'sa block is read so your entire disk beatmagnetic storage bit ssd it's split intoblocksright and these blocks are consecutivein nature now a block can be like astandard configuration of block istypically 4 kbbut you can change it you can make ityou can make it bigger or you can makeit smaller each one has its own set ofconsequence in this example let's takean example of our block size being 600bytes which means if you have if youhave let's say 1gb ofhard disk on that 1gb of hard disk600 bytes cup blocks uh like it is splitinto 600 byte blocks rightand wheneverlike let's say i have this as a spaceand it is split into four blocks for nowand let's say if i want to read thesebytes which is highlighted in uh whichis highlighted in yellow over here if iwant to read these bytes it is not thati'll only be reading these bytes so wheni'm doing a disk io the disk io willfetch the blockthat is contained or rather within whichthe bytes that i am requesting arecontentso here if i am requesting these byteswhat your disk io will do is it will goto the disk like it will hit the diskread that particular blockload it in memoryread these bytes and then send it to theuser right and basically send it for thefurther processing right sono matter how many bytes you would wantto read it's not that only those bytesare read but the entire block is abrought into memory you read that manybytes and then you basically continueyour processingright soblock is the unit of data read from thedisk rightnow let's see howour users table that we just discussedhow that fits into my block string so weknow that each record or each row of myusers table is 200 bytes longwe know that a block size for thisexample is 600 bytes right which meansthat in each block like if i amserializing this entire table in eachblock i can contain three rowsso my users table would look somethinglike this on disk so on disk i havethese blocks the four blocks that wejust discussed right so the first threerows will go and sit in the first blockthe second three rows will go and sit inthe second block and so on and so forthbecause a blockhas like let's saya block has 600 bytes cup width likethat's the size of the blockeach record is 200 bytes long so howmany rows would we fit three rowsso in this block we are putting in threerows in this block we are putting inthree rows in this block we are puttinga three dot and so on and so forth so torepresent 100 no rather to store hundredrowson the disk how many blocks would yourequire we would require 100 by 3 it is33.3 but we cannot like the block is notdivisible so we need 34 blocks to storethis entire table this entire table ontothe diskthis entire table onto the disk storedseriallyas a as a series of blockswhich is total number of blocks requiredis 34 right nowhow much time now let's say if i amgoing through this table row by row howmuch time would it require for us toread this entire tableso to read this entire table what wouldwe require iswe would have to iterate table row byrow request a particular rowthe theyour disk engine or your cpu in thatcase will identify hey i want to readthis particular block from the disk itwill go to the diskuh sorry it would say i want to readthis particular row from the disk itwould find the byte offset it would goon to the disk read that block keep inmemoryextract the record and basically use itfor further processing so the amount oftime that we would require to go throughthe entire table will be equal to theamount of time required for us to readthose many number of blocks so becauselike hyper that very hypotheticalexample but let's say if iif i like when i do a disc i o and i'mreading one blocklet's say hypothetically it takes onesecond for us to read one block from thedisk hypothetically it's it's much lowerbut hypothetically let's say it's onesecondso to read the entire table or to itrade through the entire table becausewe are reading 34 blocks how much timewould it require for us to do it it willbe 34 seconds because each block onesecond total 34 blocks so 34 secondsright so if i'm just iterating my tablerow by row it will it is taking me 34seconds to do itnow let's say we want to evaluate aquery the query goes like this that findall the users with age 23so what i typically have to do becauseup until now we have not added anyindexes to this table what are we doingto do we will iterate the table row byrowwe will read the record we will see ifthis record hasage 23 if it has we would we wouldbasically put it in and bufferuh and then we would basically collatingthat buffer so we'll be iterating it rowby row we would find all the rows withage 23 will check if the row has uhif the record has age equal to equal to23 if yes we would add that record to anoutput buffer if no we would discardthat particular record and then afterthe iteration of the table is done wewould then written the output buffer aspart of the response of my queryright so now to do this how much timewould it require because we areiterating the entire table we arerotating the entire table row by rowwhich means we'll be accessing all 34blocks so time taken for us to answerthis query is same astime taken to read all the blocks of mytable so because there are the d4 blocksit would require us 34 seconds to answerthis query right because we are readingwe are going through all of this thingnow let's see how indexes make them makethis particular flow fastersowhat exactly is an index indexare very smallreferential tablesthat holdsthe row references against the indexedvalue right it's very simple concept solet's say we because we are querying orwe want to query all users with h23uhwhat we would want is we would want tocreate an index on column hso how does that index actually bestored onto the disk see this only knowsblock right so somehow your index willalso be serialized and be stored ontothe disk as blockssoan index is very similar to like anindex to be honest is just a twodimensional oh sorry two-column tablewherethe first column is hand the second column is idwhich means it's just a it's just likean it's just like a mapping from theindexed valueto the row id or or to the row to inwhich that particular value is presentso for example here age 23so so age 23 is present for row id1 h21is present for row id2 h22 is present inrow id3so here it's that only so h21 row id2h22 raw id3 h22 is present at multipleplaces so h22 is present in row 85is 23 is present in row id 1 age 23 isalso present in row 84 and so on and soforthif you closely observethe column like your sorry your indexissortedis sorted by your indexed column whichmeans it will be sorted by theuh by age in this case so 21 minute 2324 so on and so forthrightso this is exactly how your index willalso be serialized will also beserialized and stored onto the diskrightnow let's see how much uh size or what'sthe widthof like how much size would it requirehow many bytes would it require for youto storeone entry of this index right so oneentry of this index is what one h andone id age is an integer id is aninteger so 4 plus 4 is equal to 8 bytesso each entry of this index is 8 bytebixso there will be how many entriesin the indexevery row one entry in the index sototal number of addresses is equal to100uh totals which means the total size ofindex is equal to 8 for each entry into100 entries is equal to 800 bytesour one disk block is 600 bytes so howmany disks how many disk block would werequire to disk block right sofor the as many entries as it can fillin one block it will put it allremaining address so first 600 byteswill be gone in first block remaining200 bytes will go in second block soyour index in order to represent yourindex onto your disk like if you areserializing your index and storing itonto the disk it will only require youtwo disk blocks to store thatnow let us evaluate the same querywith index and see how the flow wouldhappenso here now that we have an index on idcolumnwhat we do in worst case so this is nothow sql database or nosql database doesit it's a very simple flow that i amtaking you through uh database actuallydoes it with b plus tree and it has itsown set of importance but just tounderstand how indexes power yourdatabase let's go through the worst caseand say that every time someone queriesevery time someone queries anythingi'll go through my complete index likei'll go through my complete indexwithout any optimization right so whatwe do is we iteratethrough the complete index path so let'ssay i am firing the queries find allusers with h equal to 23 the first thingthat i'll do is i'll iterate through allthe entries in my indexright and find out whofor which h is 23i'll collect all the ids that i havelike if i am talking about this indexwhat i'll do is i'll go through thisindexlike every entryone by one and i'll find all the entrieswhose age is equal to 23.uhthen i'll get the id and i'll hold it ina uh and i'll hold it in an in memorybuffer all of these ids are somethingjust which which i am interested inbecause for these ids age is equal to 23right so i'll iterate index uh so i'lliterate my index uh entry by entry whichmeans block by block i'll check if ageis equal to 23 in the entry if yes addthe id in a buffer if no discard rightso how how many disk blocks would i haveto readto prepare thisset of ids that i am interested inbecause i am going through the entireindex an index is represented in twoblocksit will require me two risk ios that'sit so two discretes and i'll bedoneso two discretes and i'll be break andi'll be reading the entire indexuh filtering out all the values likealso so i'll be collecting all the idsthat i am interested in which meanswhose age is equal to 23and then i'll have this idand i'll have this buffer prepared rightafter i trading through the index i'llhave the list of ids that i aminterested in so first phasenow because i already have the ids thati'm interested in because of the indexthat i haveand now my next step would be to becauseto user i have to send the entire recordso my next page my next step would beusing this idi would want toget the actual row data right sothe next phase would be for all therelevant ids that i have collected afteri trading through my indexi would want to read the correspondingrecords from the main tableright so i would be reading the main thethe actual recordfrom the main table of all the ids thati uhthat i found to be relevant for h equalto 23 and i'm basically collecting it inthe buffer and then sending it out tothe user as an uh as a response rightnowhere for the second phase of it theamount of time that will require tofetch this to fetch these records uh tofetch actual records from the id wouldbe equal to the number of disk blocksthat we would have to read to answerthis thing so let's say we just take anexample ofour of our example where age is equal to23 so first space iterating through theindex finding out relevant idsreading the entire index two blocksrequired two blocks means two secondsper say like our hypothetical use caseso number of blocks read here to preparethat ide skull list is equal to twoblock reads rightnownow that i have id so for h equal to 23two row ids were imported row id one androw id fourlike id1 and id4 both of them had had agis equal to 23 right so these are theaddresses of myof my record right so these two recordsi'm interested in nowthese two records are present in howmany blockswe know that my table is sequentiallystored first three blocks were stored infirst blocksecond three rows were stored in secondblock so how many blocks so if i want toread this one block one recordas i told at the beginning of this thateven if you want to read one byte fromit your disk will always perform a blockread it would read that entire block inmemory extract that byte and thendiscard the block like it is basicallycatching it but let's say basicallydiscarding the block so if i am readingthis particular i want to read thisparticular record which means i have toread this entire block so i will readthe first three entries i'll read theblock here which means it would loadthese three records i would then findout okay for this age is equal to 23because i have the offset i can directlygo and read that record and add it to mybuffer similarly for id equal to 4 i'mfinding that it is present in the secondblock so i'm reading the second blockfrom the disk in memory finding out thatrecord uh adding it to the buffer andthen discarding it so to answer thisquery how many disk blocksto get the actual record from thereference id how many disk blocks do ihave to read to disk blocks right so toread the actual record two disk blocksto read the index to find the relevantid is two disk blocks so total number ofso total number of uh disk clocks thatwe read to answer this querywith index is equal to four blocks rightand we know that approximatelyhypothetically we took that one diskblock uh reading is equal to one secondso the total number of time that wewould require to answer this query wouldbe equal to 4 seconds right so 2 forindex 2 for record sonow if we compare the time the timetaken without so time taken to answerthe query without the index was equal to32 seconds because we had to read 32blocks iterating through the tables stepby stepwhilewith indexwith indexwe only had to read four blocks twoblocks for the index and two blocks forthe actual dataright now if we see only with thiswith this example we were able to gain8x performanceout of like just by creating an index wewere able to get 8x performance out ofmy systemright soimagine at scalehow things would happen rightbecause at scale this indexes are suchbig 8x improvement is not a smallimprovement it's a massive massivemassive improvement right so if it if aquery was taking eight seconds toexecute now it is just taking one secondto execute like that's insane amount ofspeed that you get and this which isprecisely whywhenever you are querying on any data onany database a database always like youalways have to keep an eye on are youquerying on a column that is not indexedif that is not index it in worst case itmay lead to i it may lead to sequentialiteration across like a full table scanto be honest in worst case worst caserightso that is where you need to understandthat how these blocks are you need tounderstand the importance of indexes andhow it makes things fasterthere are so many ways to implementindexes this is one very typical way ofimplementing indexes and basicallyfetching on it but it totally depends onthe database that you have at hand likefor example a few optimization that youcan do with index scanning is you maynot need to read entire index every timeif you can create a multi-level indexingso multi-level indexing is what bis what b3 and b plus three are famousfor right so they minimize the number ofblocks that you are like here right nowyou are iterating on the complete indexlike here you are iterating on thecomplete index to find out the relevantids this also can be optimized by justby doing an mba search on a b plus 3 tofind out the blocks that you areinterested in basically nothing elseright otherwise in this simple exampleonly you can just stop iterating onceyou cross 23 like you requested foraging is equal to 23 we know that indexis sorted you can start reading block byblock and as you know that hey you bryou crossed age equal to 23 here so thenyou can just stop reading it so you canyou'll just be reading one block soyou'll be saving one more disc blockread if you know that now you don't needto iterate like there are alwaysoptimizations to do that and that's whatdatabase do it well so that's what thejob of the storage engine uh storageengine of the database is on how itprocesses the index how it stores theindex or not but this would give you avery comprehensive idea on how indexesmake your database faster what's theidea behind it how diskreads happen in block center rightokay that's it from me i hope this videoadded a value and basically cleared upuh the the most fundamental thing of howindexes make your database faster and inturn uh help you understand theimportance of indexeswhile firing a query so while using asql database or any database in generalalways see you have the right set ofindexes otherwise your databasewill verywill will very quicklyuh be set on fire right because oneone rubbish query can take down yourentire database so just so just so justkeep an eye on any time your query justkeep an eye on that any query that youfire any column that you are using youare indexing you it is properly indexedbecause that's when you'll get the bestperformance of your outer databasenice so that's it from me in this videouh if you folks like this video givethis video a thumbs up if you guys likethe channel give this channel a sub andi'll see in the next one thanks a time",
    "summary": "This video explains how database indexes significantly speed up read operations by minimizing disk I/O. The core concept is that databases store data in blocks on the disk, and reading any data necessitates reading the entire block. The video uses a simplified example of a \"users\" table with several columns to demonstrate how a table is serialized and stored across multiple blocks. Without an index, querying for a specific value (e.g., users with age 23) requires iterating through every row and, therefore, reading every block of the table, leading to slower performance.\n\nIndexes are small, referential tables that map indexed values to row IDs. Creating an index on the \"age\" column, for example, creates a table that efficiently stores age values and their corresponding row identifiers. When querying with the index, the database first scans the smaller index table to find the relevant row IDs and then retrieves the actual data from the main table using those IDs. The video's example demonstrated an 8x performance improvement with an index because, in this scenario, reading the index and then the specific data blocks required far fewer disk I/O operations than reading the entire table sequentially.\n\nThe video concludes by emphasizing the importance of indexes for query performance. It also mentions optimizations, such as multi-level indexing (B-trees and B+ trees), that further reduce the number of blocks needed to be read. Failing to properly index columns used in queries can lead to full table scans and significantly degrade database performance. Properly indexing key columns helps to ensure optimal database performance and responsiveness, which is critical for scalability and overall system health."

    "transcript": "so microservices are great but they comewith a warning it says handle with careand one suchand basically one such thing that youneed to definitely handle with care istimeoutsrightso in this video let's talk about whatexactly is the problem with timeout orwhat exactly is the problem withcommunication that requires us to havebasically timeouts in place and discussfive approaches that would help youhandle timeouts better and build a veryrobust micro services based architectureso microsofts are great becauseyou canyou can you have a total separation ofconcern because your service is focusedon only that one thing it gives youflexibility and teams agility becauseyou know you can just hire specific setof people to solve that one problemreally very well which means scalingwill not be a problem you're as you'repicking the best tech stack to solvethat problem no hacks involved soeverything's great butone concern that comes in when twoservices are talking to each otherwhen two services talk to each other weneed to handle timeouts like let's let'sconsider a scenario let's say we arebuilding a search service let's say weare search tand what we have we use elasticsearch tofind the most relevant search resultsfor a particular query using uhand thenthethe the entities always you are buildingsearch is let's say blogs right and whathappens there isuser fires a search query for that givensearch query using elasticsearch we findthe most relevant blogsand we want to serve this result to theuser so we cannot directly send thisresponse to the user because there isone attribute that needs to be filledand this attribute is the total numberof views that the blog gotto date right so when the query wasfired what is the total number of viewsthat the block gotnow in order to get this one attributewhat search service would have to do iswould have to talk to analytics servicewhich has this informationright now here this communicationbecomes a synchronous communicationbecause user is firing a search queryrequest comes to search service searchservice first computes the most relevantdocument with elasticsearch then itimmediately fires a query a request toanalytics service which says that heythese are the blog ids give me basicanalytics information of all of theseblogs so it uses let's say mongodb asits database it gets that informationsends it to the search service searchservice that injects that information inthe response and sends it to the userso here the problem because this is asynchronous dependency the problem comesup when your analytic service is notresponding fast enoughrightor not responding at all rightthenhow long should your search service waitfor a response from the analytic servicethat's the concern like should it waitforever of course notit needs to wait for a sp for a maximumfor some time which is the maximum thatit can waitright and thenif it did not get response in that timewhat action should search service takelike either it can send the partialresponse that it has to the user or itcan choose to not send any response tothe userright so there are sothis is how you need to handle thetimeout so this this is very domainspecific decision that you will betaking but you need to be aware hey whatif the timeout happens what should bethe behavior in that case right solet's understand what actually could gowrongright whenthere is this inter-servicecommunication right so because once weknow what could go wrong we can thendecide on the approaches that we weretaking so first thing that could gowrong is when there is this my interservice communication is where let's saysomehowthe request made by the search servicenever reached the analytics service soit thought that it made a request and itis waiting for the response and allbutyour but it is but the request didn'teven reach there this this flow wouldnot happen when you have a tcp basedcommunication let's say you are makingan http call to analytic service to getthat information this is not possible inthat case becauseyour once if you are unable to createyour tcp connectionthen you would definitely know about itright as part of your exception orsomething but due to network congestiondue to an asynchronous communicationthis could happen where you think thatyou fired a request and waiting forresponse but this request never reachedanalytic service for some reasonsecond is although your request reachedthe analytics serviceanalytics service performed acomputation butwhen it send a response the responsenever reached you due to networkcongestion broken connection and whatnotrightthis could be second possible case thirdpossible case would be your searchservice made a request on analyticservice analytics service is computingthe response and is taking too long tocompute the response may be because ithas it is having a database outage maybebecause it is doing a lot of heavyprocessing maybe because it is overloadlike the api server of it is overloadand what not and there could be n numberof reasons to do thatlike there are so many things that cango wrong when you are having asynchronous dependency on a differentmicroservice so which is where wetalk about like how how do we solve thisproblem that is where the first thingthat we always need to take althoughlike no matter what we always have totake care ofthat whenever you are making a networkcalladd a timeout to italways always use timeouts whenever youare making a synchronous call to aservice you do not or you cannot and youshould notwait forever for the response tofor the response to reach you like itshould be like hey i'll wait at max forlet's say one second two seconds fivesecond ten second depending on yourdomainand then if you don't get a responsethen you say hey now it's a timeout nowi'll do whatever i want i was waitingfor response enough so it's like meetingher it's liketwo friends decided to like you and yourfriend decided to meet and your frienddidn't show up how long would you waityou can't wait foreveryou have to you have to wait for a maxversion listed 10 minutes 15 minutes andthen you say hey hello i'm goingrightso this is the exact same thing with twofriends trying to meet one friend didn'tshow up how long should the first friendwaitso this the maximum time that it wouldwait is called as a timeout rightso let'sand thethe timeout is not something which isveryit just it is very prescriptive itdepends on the use case that you havethat how long should be the timeoutlet's say in a service like searchalthough i wrote 10 seconds but in aservice like search you could you don'twant your end user to wait for even morethan a second your search result needsto be served very fast so it might be inlike 200 milliseconds 300 millisecond500 milliseconds but there has to bethis timeout that other service agreesor hey i'll be no matter what i'll beserving the response in let's say 100millisecond so you can keep your sla for200 millisecond or something right buttimeout contract should definitely bethere now let's see whenwhen search service was when service onewas communicating with service to andservice student send a responsewhat should be like how should we handlethat timeout let's say the timeouthappened now how should we handle itso we'll here we'll discuss fire processto do that approach one ignorethe best one let's assume thatthe but obviously not recommended butlike like when you don't catch anyexception this is what you're typicallydoing you are ignoring where you madethe call where your search service madea call to analytic service and it and itresulted into and it basically waitedfor something i did get a response itjust ignored it and just moved forwardso whatever the partial response that ithad it just sent it to the user ratherthan waiting heywhat needs to be done so just ignoringthethethe no show of that other service thathe let me move forward with itso hereone thing is that we either assume thatthe operations like in some cases wherewe may assume that the operation issucceeded where we did not get aresponse like not in search andanalytics use case but some other usecase let's say you want toasynchronously store something in thedatabase and you put the message you youdidn't get a response you didn't get anacknowledgement from it let's say youare putting a message in let's say abroker let's say a rapid time queue butyou didn't get a response saying thatheyyou didn't get a response from rabbit mqthat says that hey i have stored themessage so you can assume that messageis storedbut in reality it might have happenedthat message is not stored in rebatemqfor other to consume right so it dependsso you can assume that the operationthat you are trying to do is succeededhas succeeded but in actuality fails itleads to unpredictable user experienceright you think it's done but it's notdoneso ignoreas an approach might not be the bestthing to dobut in some cases it is good to ignorethings and just move forward right inlife and in microservices bothand so a good practice to ensure isthat always always always catch all theexceptions that you get and handle themin an informed way hey timeout happenedwaited for the response uh somethingwent bad on the other server or otherservice you get a particular exceptionin whatever so handle all of thatexception when you're making uh asynchronous tcp call asynchronousmessage broker push anything handle ithandle exceptions and take an informeddecision depending on the type ofexception that you will get so there isa like anytime you make a call to theservice you know what kind of exceptionsto expectso do that depending on the context doit very well do not just ignorebut in some cases you can do it by thewayapproach number two configure and usedefaults so let's say in case of searchand analytic survey this this fits invery wellsouh wait i'll move here in thereso let's say with respect to configureand use default let's say you havesearch service an analytic serviceyour search service waited for less than200 milliseconds for it to get responsethe only data it was relying on analyticservice to get response was the totalnumber of blockswhat ifwhen when the timeout happened whichmeans for let's say it waited for 200milliseconds but it did not get anyresponse so what you can doyou can use the default value let's saytotal number of blocks is equal to zeroright you were waiting for a responsebut you didn't get it so you're usingtotal number of blocks equal to 0 as adefault value so this is another way ofhandling timeouts where in some cases itmight be possible for you to use adefault value instead of not returningany response to the user you can justuse a default value and then send it tothe userokay approach number three the mostfamous one retryso this is whereyou assume that if you do not get aresponse so whenever there is a timeoutyou assume that the remote operationfailedso then you retry itright so retries are very simple when itis read request like in search andanalytics use caseit's very easy for you to retry so youwaited for 200 millisecond you didn'tget a response so your natural responseto that is hey let me retry that rightso you will retry theyou'll you'll basically fire the samething again on your analytic servicewaiting for the response expecting thatnow it would return you inin let's say 50 milliseconds right soretries are simple and it is simple forread requestbut they become very trickywhenyour request is non idempotent like whatis hard important which means that sameoperation fire twice will not have anyrepercussions on to it so other servicesis handling it well so uh like you firethe same thing twice nothing likebasically nothing weird happens on thatso you can fire the same operation asmany times and it would lead to theexact same thingon that particular endso your request is non-idempotent forexample uh a good example for that ofnon-item potency is let's say you areyou are transferring money from accounta to account bif you do retry let's say you fired aquery that does transfer from thattransfers money from account a toaccount bbut you didn't but but when you firedthat query and you waited for thatresponse it resulted in a timeoutnow if you retry this operation so let'ssay a wanted to transfer 10 rupees tosorryaccount athe overall money of basically 10 rupeesneeds to be transferred from accountedto account b and it failed because oftime out and you retried it right so butit it was actually a success but whenyou retried itinstead of transferring 10 rupees from ato b now 10 plus 10 20 rupees gottransferred to b's account b is happybut a is notso this kind of request are non-itempotent request so you need to know thatifthe communication that you are doingbetween two services if that otherservice request is item potent or not ifit is not item potent then youdefinitely don't want to retryrightsecond is like whenthis becomes tricky when retries becometricky is when your request is expensivelet's say there is a very heavyreal-time analytics query that you arefiring that is computing a lot of thingsin real timewhich is which is very heavy onanalytics but that is you are doing itsynchronously for some reason but ifit's a very expensive to compute it youmight want tonot repeat that operationone of the use case would be maybe avery heavydeep learning based gpu base some queryor some request that you are firing notreally synchronously or something butit's very heavy to compute so you youmay choose not to do it rightthen third thing is when uh situationsbecome tricky is when other servicesoverloaded so the idea the the situationislet's say your search service wasdepending on your analytic service andyou fired a request analytics you didn'tget a response and there was a timeoutso you said hey let me retryso you are you are continuously retryingto make the call to analytic service butin reality analytics service is actuallyoverloadedso your retries is making the situationworse for analytic service so that'swhere you need to know when you shouldbe retrying like in this case when yourother service is already overloaded andyou are firing that query again andagain and again and againthen the load will never decrease onthat service so that service will neverget time to recoverright so retry has become tricky thenso a few good practices to take carewhen you are sure that you would want toretryis retry with exponential back off donot just immediately like apply for loopand just just just keep on retryingimmediately like it failed retry failedretro it will retractthis is where you typically seeexponential backups kicking in whichsays that hey you first make a retry inone second if you still get a timeoutyou retrap to two seconds if you stillget a timeout you will retractor fourseconds so there is an exponential backoff that you are doing so one second cutdelay then two second delay then foursecond delay then eight second delay andso on and so forthand other thing that you definitelyshould think about is where like ifyou're dependent or your if sorry ifyour depending service is idempotent ornot so anytime you design a service tryto make it as item potent as you canlike just ensure that if you are leavingout a scope of idempotents it should bevery minimal make it as adapted as youcan because that would give you thatthat would give other service theconfidence to make as many calls as itcanwithout leading to any weird behaviorapproach number four retry only ifneeded so the in the third approach wechose to do continuous retryuh or what we or we talked about ittrying but approach number four saysyou can retry but only when it is neededwhich says that somehow you have thisoption to check that hey if thisrequires a retry then only i'll returnotherwisefor exampleuh in some service you might have a wayto check if the operation is successfulor notso you fired a query to service aservice a talks to service buh service a when when made thatoperationdidn't get a response it led to timeoutbut somehowwhen the your services tried to retrythat operation it had a way to found outto find out ifthat operation that it done that it didpreviously was success or notsomehow it has a way to find it i willgo through an example on what exactlyhappens like how howit can be seen in real worldbut if it has a way to find if that issuccess or notright you can leverage that that youwill choose to do retry only ifthe your past operation was not asuccess and you have a way to check itan example is let's say a user tweetingthe same post twice accidentallywithin a particular time range let's saytwitter added a check saying that hey auser ifpost the same server the same tweettwicewithinone minute it might be like user whenclicking on tweet button might haveaccidentally clicked it twice maybe somebug or something happen rightsoto prevent the situation what twittermight dois like let's say the the javascriptclient of user is is doing that retrythe user made a slash post request ontwitter's api server or somethingit stores tweeters tweets in thisdatabaseright so when user fired two queriesback to backright so sorrywhen user fired one api request to tweetsomething this tweets get stored in acache or something where you are storinguser ones recent tweets right so useryou are made a tweet user one recenttweets are stored in an array in somecache let's say redis or a memcache orsomethingand thenit is storing in the main database wherethe tweet is actually registered rightand now somehow user one didn't get aresponse from the twitter zip so usermade a slash post uh slash tweet requestto twitter but it didn't get a responseso js client of user1 retried itnow because that retry was done veryquicklyyour twitter might just check in thecache to see hey does this user like didthis user just made that same tweetif the user did thenyour twitter repair might send an errorsaying hey i think you just made a tweetyou might want to like like do youreally want to repeat that rightsomething around that so i've seen thisbehavior in a few websites out therewith mostly social media websites inwhich it just gives you a warning thatsays hey are you sure you just tweetedthe same thinga few minutes ago do you want to retweetthat so do you want to again tweet thatfor that senseso this is one solid use case when youare retrying only when it is neededapproach number fivere-architect solike one thing to always think about iswhy do you need a synchronous dependencyin the first place can you make itasynchronous so for a search andanalytics service you might want tothink twice before you do that whererequest comes to search service fromsearch service it goes to analyticservice synchronously what ifanalytics data is ingested in yourelastic search so it removes yourdependency on analytic servicealtogetherright so always think about somethinglikehave a have a micro service silo ifanyone wants to communicate to thisthink about can you make it asynchronous can you remove thedependency yes sorry can you remove asynchronous dependency on that otherservice if you can that's the bestbest possible thing that you can doso few good approaches this like goingfor an event-driven architectureoringesting the required data from theother service into this service so thatthis service like your search serviceworks independently without having asynchronous dependency so try so try toremove synchronous communication as muchas you cango for an event-driven architecturereinvest the the data duplicate the datainto your service like ingest it in yourservice andmultiple ways to do it butre-architecting your solution might bethe best long-term solution that you cango for in some cases it is not possiblebut in most cases it is so try to thinkin that wayright sofrom this entire discussion a few thingsthat we can definitely uh have as a keytakeaway firstalways have timeouts whenever wheneveryou are doing communication synchronouscommunication with any service havetimeouts you cannot wait forever rightsecond pick a timeoutpicking a timeout value is very trickylike if it's too short then you'll havea lot of false positives let's say yourit takes for your database or it takesfor analytic service to respond in let'ssay200 millisecond and you are having timeout of let's say 150 millisecond sounreal expectations from it soin most casesyou you would have a response but youwould still be seeing timeouts so a lotof false positives if your timeout valueis too short but if it is too long it isyou'll have a you'll have a performancebottleneck because you are waiting forfar long let's say if you arelet's say if you're waiting for ananalytic service to respond in twoseconds so you're waiting for far longit is putting a lot of pressure on yourservice as well because the throughputof your service is going downand unnecessarilyleading to a poor user experienceand third thing is make retries safewherever possible try to design yourservice in the in like with item potencyin mindif you are not thinking that thenretries will become very tricky for theservices that are consuming your serviceso try to be as item potent as you canwith respect to your implementationall rightnice so that's itso yeah basically that's all what iwanted to cover with respect to handlingtimeouts in a micro services based setupso i hope you found it interesting so ifyou folks like this video give thisvideo a big thumbs up if you guys likethe channel give this channel a sup andi'll see you in the next one thanks",
    "summary": "This YouTube video addresses the complexities of handling timeouts in microservice architectures, emphasizing that inter-service communication introduces potential points of failure. The core problem arises when one service (e.g., a search service) synchronously depends on another (e.g., an analytics service) to fulfill a request. If the analytics service is slow or unresponsive, the search service must decide how long to wait and what action to take upon timeout. The video outlines potential issues like requests not reaching the destination, responses being lost, or the target service being overloaded, leading to delayed responses.\n\nThe video then presents five approaches for managing timeouts gracefully. First, \"Ignore\" suggests proceeding with a partial response, potentially assuming success even without confirmation, which can lead to unpredictable user experiences. The second, \"Configure and Use Defaults,\" involves providing a default value in case of a timeout, improving user experience by offering some data instead of none. The third, \"Retry,\" proposes re-attempting the request upon timeout, but warns of potential pitfalls with non-idempotent requests or overloaded services. The fourth approach, \"Retry Only If Needed,\" involves checking the operation's status before retrying to avoid redundant actions. Finally, \"Re-architect\" advises to eliminate the synchronous dependency altogether, potentially through event-driven architecture or data duplication, leading to more resilient and independent services.\n\nThe key takeaways are to always implement timeouts in synchronous communication, carefully choose timeout values to avoid false positives or performance bottlenecks, and strive for idempotency in service design to make retries safer. The video emphasizes that a well-thought-out timeout strategy is essential for building robust and reliable microservice-based applications, ensuring a positive user experience even in the face of inter-service communication failures."

Also, last week Idid a full seven days in the tower doingnothing but vibe coding with cursor andalso regular coding and also complainingabout AIS and then also loving tab. Verycomplicated relationship right now. ButI have a problem here. April 1st. Idon't know where this is going to go.Like is this going to be a good articleor is this going to be another articlein which I get sad about reading becauseit's April 1st. Let's find out. TLDDR. Ichoose to make using AI a manual actionbecause I felt the slow loss ofcompetence over time when I relied on itand I recommend everyone to be cautiouswith making AI a key part of theirworkflow. I still think I'm going to getI still think I'm going to get AI uhwhat's it called? April fooled here anymoment. Here we go. We're going to getready. Uh in the late 2022, I used AItools for the first time. Even beforethe first version of Chad Jippity uh in2023, by the way, the first time usingCopilot, I still remember. I still I Italk about this all the time is themagic moment. Magic moment. Absolutelymagic. One of the best moments I've everhad. Very, very magic. In 2023, Istarted using AI based tools in mydevelopment workflow. Initially, I wassuper impressed with the capabilities ofLLMs. The fact that I could just copyand paste obscure compiler errors alongwith C++ source code and be told wherethe error is cause uh caused felt likemagic. Yeah. Yeah, that does feel likemagic because forget C++ errors. Yo. Yo,if there's one thing I hate more in lifethan C++ errors, it's signing into myterminal, right? Like there's few thingsI hate more, but that's one of them. Um,once GitHub Copilot started becomingmore and more powerful, I started usingit more and more. I used various otherLLM integrations right in my editor,using AI as a part of my workflow. I dowant to say though that GitHub Copilotsucks. It just does. It's not good. It'snot been good. It's not being good. It'snot looking good. It doesn't feel good.It doesn't make me happy. It's justmostly bad. It predicts many two lines.It's often just gross. It's just wrong.But I've been converted. I've alwayssaid I've always said this for a longtime. I think the best AI coding likeassist isn't these question and askingvibe coding approaches. I think they'rejust horrible. The best assist is areally good autocomplete. And before Iever even used cursor, I we were I evenkind of made my own little quick versionin uh VS or Vim just to kind of feel howit would be in a neoim feel what it was.And I was like, \"Okay, that's prettycool.\" But then when I use cursor, itactually has such a good version ofcopilot. Their version of copilot tab isso good. It's totally worth at leastgiving a try, but your skills willimmediately atrophy. It's always theproblem about offloading stuff. Themoment you offload, you just don't thinkabout things as more. Anyways, in thelate 2024, I removed all LLMintegrations for my code editors. Istill use LLM occasionally, and I do notthink AI can be used in a way that isvery beneficial for manyprogrammers. Generally agree. So thenwhy don't I use AI powered code editingtools? Uh Tesla FSD from 2019 to 2021 Idrove a Tesla. Bros just out there justtelling you what he's driving flexing onus kids. 2019 Tesla days. Those arepretty popular days a Tesla. Though Iwould never make the same purchaseagain. Not for political reasons, justbecause the cars are quite low quality,very overpriced, and a hell to repair ormaintain. Yeah, I've heard the I'veheard the repairing is insane. By theway, when I was in the Bay Area, likethe 2014, 2015, 2019, it was a flexa tohave a Tesla, right? When I got myTesla, I started using the fullself-driving FSD anytime I could. Itfelt great just to put the car on FSD onthe highway and zone out a bit.Switching lanes was as simple as hittingthe turn signal, and the car wouldswitch lanes. Driving for me was gettingto the highway, turning on FSD, tellingthe car to switch lanes every now andthen, and listen to music and podcastswhile zoning out. If you drive a caroften, you'll know that when you'redriving on the highway, everything sortuh sort of happens automatically.Keeping your car in the lane at theright speed becomes a passive action. Itdoes not require the type of focus that,for example, reading a book requires.It's the same type of focus that walkingrequires. It happens in the backgroundof your mind. Fair. It's just reallyannoying. So far, he's making a greatcase for me to want to get aself-driving car. I hate driving. I justhate driving. Driving is hypnosis, dude.It's Dude,it's In the period of from 2019 to 2021,I exclusively drove my Tesla for longerrides. After 2021, I went back todriving regular cars, and making theswitch was definitely not what Iexpected. Driving on the highwayrequired my full attention for the firstuh for the first month or so. I had torelearn keeping the car in the middle ofthe lane without thinking about it.Being reliant on Tesl Tesla's FSD tookaway my own ability to go intoautopilot. Okay, that's actually aninteresting argument. So I think theargument he's trying to make is thattasks in which we do regularly becomebackground tasks like walking. There's alot of like hidden things that you dothat you don't realize you're doing orthe calculations that are required thatyour body just does naturally for you.And if you take that ability to do thataway, the natural easy thing that usedto be easy becomes hard. Okay, that's agood Hey, it's a good it's a it's a verygood basis to build a good argument. Ithink I think this is Yeah, literallymuscle memory. Well, it's actually likespinal memory to be completely fair.Everyone talk about it, but uh this isactually a really I think this isactually a pretty great basis for anargument. My experience with AI codeeditors working with AI powered codeeditors was somewhat similar. Initially,I felt that I was comp uh I completedwork a lot faster when assisted by AI.The work I was doing most of the timewas not super complex and AI felt likeputting my Tesla on FSD. I could justguide the machine to do the work for me.Yeah. Yeah. In my free time, I startedworking on side projects on my personalaccount on my work device. Uh on thisaccount, I did not have access tocopilot and other cool fancy AI tools.This is when using AI started to feelvery similar to te uh the Tesla FSDstory. Yeah. Now that I got done usingcursor for a week, honestly, going backto Neil Vim, sometimes I'm uh sometimesI'm in here and when I start going hereand I go like this. All right. Uh or Igo uh param and I'm like gosh justautocomp completed already for me. Yeah,I have a snippet but then I have to golike number and I have to go number andthen I have to like go number, right? Ohmy gosh, just I already know what youwant. You know what I want? I know whatI want. Just make it happen, right? Andif I use co-pilot, I could get that backon. But co-pilot's also super annoyingeverywhere else cuz copilot's likeactually. And it's always wrong like 95%of the time it feels like and just makesme feel like I'm going to go bonkers. Ohmy gosh. It just I just want I just Ijust hate I just hate using it. It'slike pair programming with the mostannoying person in the universe. Uh youjust get to see their thoughts just allthe time. All right. Anyways, I feltless competent at doing what I was quitebasically software development than ayear or so before. All of a sudden, itmade very clear to me how reliant I hadbecome on AI tools. I don't think thisis a bad thing, right? Like I'm not sureif it's a bad thing. I have to thinkabout this more, but I'm not quitepositive if the if just programming isthe end- all beall. I think that youlose a lot of really keen sense ofwhat's going on when you don't type ityourself. And I think that you lose alot of mastery and you lose a lot ofjust like familiarity with the API andyou lose like but I could also arguethat LSP in some sense makes the exactsame thing happen that the LSP itselfalso makes you lose some of that qualitythat when it comes to being a reallygood programmer. I think they're on anear same level. Not quite. They'rethey're like a different in they're adifferent in magnitude not a differencein kind. Uh anytime I defined a functionI paused in my editor to wait until theAI tools would write the implementationfor me. It took some effort to rememberwhat the syntax was to write a unit testby hand. Ah yes the old co-pilot pause.So this is a real effect for those thatare using uh AI regularly. Try uh justtry writing without it for a second. Trywriting without copilot and you'llrealize that you just like stop and yourbrain just like literally turns off. LSBfor faster navigation, by the way, isvery, very good. I like that. You likeliterally turn off your brain and it'sjust super annoying and you're like, whyam I turning it off all the time? Uh,with my work, AI started to become lessuseful over time as well. Not only didit take out the uh out the fun for me,but I started to feel a bit insecureabout making some implementationdecisions myself. Oh, interesting.Outsourcing the decisions to the AIseemed a lot easier, but sometimes theAI couldn't figure things out even withthe best prompts. uh it was quite clearthat because I did not practice thebasics often I was less capable with theharder parts as well. So this actuallywas an argument within um the there wasa paper by Microsoft and Carnegie Melonabout the effects of turning offcritical thinking and uh using AI andthey made this really great argument. Iforget what the there's an author thattalks about to do the hard thingsrequires you to do the easy thingsmillions of times. And so one of theirkind of core arguments of the paper wasthat by stopping doing the easy things,the harder things become harder, whichis actually a pretty interestingargument. The paper took literally 30pages to say like a two sentence to saytwo sentences. It was absolutelymind-numbing to read, right? It waslike but it was like a really uh itcomes from Whitehead. It comes it'sactually let's see it's an old argument.And it comes from Whitehead. Uh well,the real analysis of it. Yeah. So,there's like this idea that if you don'tmake a thousand little decisions thatare easy, you're not going to be able tomake one hard decision. And that's allthere is to it. And it's it he's kind ofI think he's saying that without sayingthatuh with my work, AI started to becomeless Oh, I already read that. Uh theloss of finger uh finger spits and goiluh finger spits and goil. Yeah. is a jamand term literally meaning fingertipsfeeling. Oh yeah, the feelings go feeland meaning intuitive flare or instinctwhich has been adopted by the Englishlanguage as a lone word. It describes agreat situational awareness and theability to respond most appropriatelyand tactfully. Interesting. So it's likea it's like a form it's like a form ofmuscle memory but in the realm ofcompetency. To play an instrument veryfast, the only way to play it uh is toplay very slow in repetition over time.I think this is I think this often withAI plus programming. Interesting. Yeah,fingerfeel. We do we just call is this what wecall uh muscle memory otherwise known astouch in the NFL? Yeah, finesse. And Ithink in sports ball we call it finesse.Who who no one uses this word. I thinkwe just call it finesse. Right. Heyfinger spits. Thank you. The only way tochop fast is to start chopping slowly.Yes. Correct. Defing seniority is a verytough thing. Though in my opinion, a lotof being a senior is in soft skills.When it comes to the technical hardskills, a lot comes down to fingerspits. I don't even know how to say thatword. The longer you work with alanguage framework or codebase, the moreyou develop this kind of intuition ofwhat the correct approach is. Yeah, Ithink that's all true, right? Likeanyone who's worked in a largercodebase, it's like mysterious, large,and annoying at first and becomes easierand nicer as time goes on and theneventually it becomes easy to work in.And then soon you're off running fast.And that's just like, you know, we Ithink people often can call that thinglike tribal knowledge. People try to sayyou need to document everything, butthere's a certain level of documentationthat just stops working. Like you justcan't do it. It no longer works in thatrealm. It's like, yeah, intuition, it'sgood. It's a good thing. It feels goodto be an expert at something. Um, thegut feeling of something feels offslowly turns into a feeling of this iswhat we should do. This developedintuition is not just an architecturallevel level. A big component is in thelower level details. When you usepointers or what type of pointers,whether you use asserts or checks, whatto pick from the standard library whenmultiple options are available. Thosesenior C++ programmers still can't seemto agree on this. This intuition is whatI was slowly losing when relying on AItools a lot. And this is coming from alead developer. When I see a lot of hypeabout vibe coding, I can't help butthink, how do you exactly expect to vibecode your way to a senior? Where wherewill you get the skills? uh from tomaintain and extend the vibe coding codebase when the AI tools are down or havebecome too expensive. I think I mean Ithink there's probably a level ofintuition finger spits finger spritesand there's a bit of finesse thatprobably comes with uh prompts andcontext that you also can probably growon when it comes to prompting. There arepeople who are better at prompting thanme. Uh Cockorn, don't even try that withme. Uh L take it's always becoming uhit's always up and becoming cheaper. Uhlately things haven't been cheaper.Okay, I'm just saying Jippy 45 is reallyexpensive. Okay, Sam Alman was promisingis promising me 10x cheaper per year and6 months after he said that it got 100xmore expensive. Okay, this is stupid. Iwant a 10x. Sam wouldn't lie, would he?He did he did just get done raising 40billion. So sure I'm now he's I'm surehe's tweeting now like wow man thisshit's expensive. We got a lot of moneyto fix these problems now. Don't youworry. Eggs went up almost 10%. Yeah. Or10x. Yeah. It's crazy. Uh even withlarger context windows, more computingpower, reasoning models or agents, therewill be things that AI won't be able todo. Over time, the AI tools will getmore and more powerful. Sure. But whenyou receive a Slack message that uh thewebsite works fine, but the app is downin production. I tried locally and thereit works fine. Nothing in sensoryeither. Good luck getting an a AI agentto fix this for you. Maybe it can, maybeit can't. And when the AI agent can'tfigure it out, will you reply, \"Sorry,cursor doesn't get it. We'll uh we'llprompt moretomorrow.\" I do love that, David. Sorry.We'll prompt again tomorrow. I'm kind ofout. I'm kind of, you know, my creativeprompt juices are kind of out for theday, so I'm just going to prompt againtomorrow. Okay, dude. That's such agreat phrase. I want to use this all thetime. You can get by without thesetools. Yeah, you most certainly can. Uhpeople that say that like you're beingleft behind, I think are incorrect. Youknow, I haven't used tab or cursor untiljust last week. And after using it justfor one moment, maybe like what an hourand a half, I became a very big expertat exactly how tab works and where itworks and why it works and when to useit. And so it's just like I don't thinkI just don't think there's like thisso-called barrier to entry where it'slike if you're not profiting now, you'renever profiting again. Okay, so you'resaying they're going to get better allthe time? Yeah, they're going to getmuch better. We're going to get way moreintegrated. It's going to be completelydifferent here in like three years.Okay. So, what am I learningnow? Checkmate, atheist. Uh, you can getby with these tools. Uh, you're late forfor things. Uh, sometimes it feels likeyou have to use AI or be out of a job in6 months. We've been hearing the 3 to 6months away now story forever. Uh, overtwo years at this point. Uh, when I gotmy Tesla in 2019, I paid6400 for functionality that was supposedto arrive in 3 to 6 months from now. Andthe functionality is still not presentthe way it was promised over five yearsago. Self-driving cars is like thegreatest look into the future. Look atself-driving cars. We've been promisedself-driving cars for a long, long time.Right now, it is unlikely that lettingAI do your coding work for largerprojects than a university project. Whenworking on legacy systems or largerprojects in enterprise or when you needto work with a and consult a lot ofdependency internals like I do withUnreal Engine, AI tools will often notbe able to make things work. When youneed to work with internal DSLs, uhtools or frameworks, good luck gettingLLMs to generate uh useful output forindustries. You can't even use AI toolsat all for a multitude of reasons. Yeah,first off, let's go backwards that list.By the way, this is really important. Ifyou solely depend on this, you're likenot getting a job in medical, finance,government, banking, like there's awhole slew of industries that just likeAI not allowed, right? And I'm sure thatwill change over time and things willchange and blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah, but right now likethat's just like a closed door for you.So, it's a good thing to re recognizeand I don't know. Let's see. Uh, Goldmanis big on AI tools now for dev. Yeah.And so that could change in banks, butI'm not sure how fast or quick that'sgoing to change. Uh, second off, this isreally, really good. I think the biggesttakeaway you can take from this sentenceis stop making DSLs. Just useLua. Just Lua. Lua easy, DSL hard. Everytime I make DSL, I make sad. Like that'sit. That's it. That's it. That's that'sall that's all I have to say for that.For some things, you really should notwant to rely on AI when implementingauthentication systems like JWT signinguh or RBAC. Adding uh and it should besecure to the prompt won't make itsecure if it's been trained on GitHubcode that had CVEEs. By the way, there'san if statement in here that's notuseful and also is a very very excitingpart about the future. Security is goingto be a very needed field for a longtime because the reality is where isthis code coming from? It's coming fromGitHub. Where are we discovering allthese security issues? They're always insoftware that is open source that peopleuse. Why? That's because like securityissues are just a natural part ofprogramming. So, if everything's trainedon this, what's going to happen? It'sjust going to make more of it. It's justgoing to replicate it. Statisticallyspeaking, it makes security problems foryou. Everybody's just stealing myterrible code. Uh, when it comes tosecurity, you should be the person whois responsible and understands thisfully. Critical systems should bewritten and reviewed by humans. here.Actually, a great example. NextJS lastsecurity uh bug. This was just up here.Where was it? Their low-level alertinghad a really great one, but it's very,very simple. Here's how effectively itworks, right? It says it lets attackersbypass authentication. Uh maybe thiswill be it. But here, let me let me justgive you the the skinny of how it works.It's very very simple. there exists somesort of like X uh trust me bro headerthat you could just add to a request andif the middleware saw trust me bro itwould just go uh yeah we don't need torun authentication on this request andthat was just out there the whole ideawas this uh the idea why this thingexists to begin with uh dev's doingsecurity am I right the reason why thisexisted is that you have some sort ofHTTP request coming in right uh and Thenit goes into your system. Well, then youhave middleware that goes off and does arequest cuz everything is likemicroservices and all this stuff to goand see are you authenticated? Thatauthentication needs to make a requestthat needs to pass through middlewareagain apparently like apparently this ishow people have things set up. So thenit would then do this thing forever. Sotheir way around that was x trust me broand bro would be like ah trust you andyou just pass right through themiddleware and just keep on going or youpass right through the authentication uhmiddleware like that's it was SSA. Yeah.Super secureauthentication. Trust me, bro. True.True. Right. That's insane. I mean, it'sit's a thing. It's just it it justhappened. Um, is it a is it is it is itthat crazy? It's really not that crazy.There it is. X middleware sub request.That's the trust me, bro. Right.Everybody was clapping when someoneintroduced this optimization. Exactly.When someone solved this recursivemiddleware request thing, everybodyclapped. Beautiful. Absolutelybeautiful. There's there's about 10 moredozen examples of this uh of the sametype of attack. Oh, it existseverywhere. Good answer. Good answer.Right. And so it's just like rememberthat was just fixed like a week ago inNex.js. That means there is a nonzerochance that if you're doing security inan AI's programming, things can happen.You know, you might just accidentallyeat that snake's tail. When it comes tosecurity, you should be the person whois responsible and understands thisfully. I've done that and I've alsointroduced security problems. Criticalsystems should be written and reviewedby humans. And if we are heading to asituation where one AI agent writes thecode and another reviews theautogenerated PR and then another AIagent deploys the code, we will see ahuge spike of security issues soon.Absolutely. Like absolutely. By the way,that was not a knock against Nex.js. Uhfor those that are wondering, this isjust why it's hard. Like security ishard and things that seem likereasonable solutions to somebody thatdoesn't have the context of how thingswork will go, \"Wow, that's a reasonablesolution.\" Because you know, whoevermade that change, there was probablysomebody else that reviewed it and said,\"Oh, that's a good idea. Good answer,Todd.\" Right? Like Todd made it like I'ma genius. And then somebody else waslike, \"Todd's a genius.\" Right? Likethere's multiple people that let thisthing go through. Who knows how many,right? So, uh, let's see. As an XJS, uh,NexJS user, it should have been a knockon NextJS. It's not It's not a knock onNext.js. It's just like that's the likesecurity is hard. Security it. Uh, whatwhat was it? Uh, Androl from the BlackTower, Wheel of Time, book 14. Uh, boom.Yeah, we're citing more Wheel of Time.I'm just about to finish Wheel of Time.Okay. uh someone uh the uh Pava was withhim and she's like all men are ignorantand he said yes that's because not allmen can know everything and so everyoneis ignorant of something which isawesome which is an awesome line youit's just it's just simple ignorance onsecurity right it's not it's not it's Iit's not even a knock against him rightwhere I draw the line I still use AIsometimes I think it can be a great toolwhen used wisely I draw the line atintegrations I keep AI fully separatefrom my code editor. So that's actuallymy opposite take. If you're going to useAI, you might as well have it in youreditor. Uh all of the context I addmanually. I intentionally keep theeffort required quite high. So it is uhso it decentizes me. Interesting. Okay.That's because you can't help yourself.Okay. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Umlet's see. Examples of where I use AIfor work include convert these go testsinstructs to tests in a map. Fair.Convert this calculation to SIMD. Thisis nuts. Uh, and when the content typeis application zlib, decode the body, Ihave to set up some custom instructionsto only give me the code that haschanged and to give me instructions foradding it. This way, I'm still the onemaking the changes in the codebase. Justapproving a git diff is not enough. Iwant to manually add the code myself.Only then do I feel confident to signoff it or off on it and takeresponsibility for it. Yeah, I meanthere there is something to that whereyou can get lost in the sauce of a gitdiff. That's fair. You could get lost inthe sauce. That's that's fair. Thathappens. It's easy to like That's whywhen I do a review of code, I think it'seasier to do a review code on GitHubthan in my editor. Like even though Iknow how to do diffs on my editor, Iknow how to do all those things. I candefinitely look at stuff. I just look atit differently when I'm on GitHub. Likemy my mind changes. I have this veryintense kind of thought process becauseI've trained myself when I'm on awebsite. I somehow just review it betterthan when I'm in my editor. When I'm inmy editor, I just don't review it aswell. I don't know why. I can't explainwhy. I don't think it's a UI problem. Ithink it's a mentality problem for me. Ithink it's just simply when I look atit, I've adopted the mentality of I'mreviewing and a lot different likeinternal like it's like driving on thehighway. I don't think about it anymore,but it's like it's like this automaticprocess that comes up. I'm not eventrying to say it's good or bad. I'm justsaying it's just I get it. Another greatuse case for AI is learning. I oftenhave questions that are quite uncommonas I have a few very niche interests.Turns out adding net code to a customgame engine using ECS doesn't have a lotof learning resources. What has workedfor me is asking the AI to explainpieces of code like explain thisassembly code. Explain what this shaderdoes. Which books go in depth aboutresolving client server desyncs in gameengines? The AI seems to struggle withthese sometimes. I'm getting mixedresults, but the results are still muchbetter than search engines. Yeah, I dolike uh AI as a search engine. I thinkthat I dude RIP Google or not even RIP,you know, rest in rest in poop Google, Idislike you. Uh I don't like Google atall. Uh I will even use it for thisarticle though I'm not right. Let's see.Though not for writing content, but forchecking like AI as search is prettygreat. I like AI. AI search very good.Another benefit of using AI this way isthe cost. No unnecessary API calls,manually managing context, and morecontrol over the LLM settings. I use adesktop application with a bunch ofdifferent LLMs hooked up to it. I haveused it daily for the last three monthsor so and in total I have consumedaround $4 in credits. I don't want toadd let's see I do want to add that withsome things I am more strict on mypersonal website. I don't have any AIgenerated content whether that's text orimages. I don't like the AI generatedimages or art personally for variousreasons and I think AI generated textlacked character. It feels very flat andboring when something is created byhumans. it it to me has more value thanuh when it's create created by AI. Yeah,that's fair. I think a lot of peoplefeel that way. So, I I'm I'm on thisteam. I'm I'm on that team. AI isstealing uh artist jobs is brain rot.It's not I I don't think it's brain rot.I think AI is going to take artist jobsfor sure. I think a lot of people like Ican't tell you how many people that justneed like small icons or potions fortheir games and stuff like that andthey'll just generate it uh and justkind of walk away with it. especially alot of indie stuff, stuff that's onlyran by one person. Totally can see thatconsuming a lot of like what used tohave to be, well, I won't have good artunless if I have an artist. Uh I I thinkit's going to happen, but again, I thinkthat's that's because it's it's againmeasuring the wrong thing, which at theend of the day, it's about measuring theoutput. Like we could have generated allthetowers, all the tiles, all the dirt andeverything for our tower defense game,but instead we had Adam see Ununice. Youmay have heard of him. amazing pixelartist guy come and join us at the towerand he was there he was talking he wascoming up with ideas he was making greatart the art is so coherent through allthe pieces of art that it's much muchbetter and that's because it's notcreated in a vacuum it's createdholistically from one person so there'slike a theme and a feel that's reallyreally amazing and this is of course menot touching on any of the topics aroundlike copyright licenses and all that Ithink that's going to be an entire likeI think the next five years we will seesome pretty seriousissues when it comes to AI and thatdon't steal Adam from releasing hisgame. I only used him for a week or 5days. So, it's very very little and he'salready in America and he was alreadytraveling for GDC. So, it's not it'sit's not a lot, right? I think I thinkuh AI is going to have a lot of a lot ofproblems uh when it comes to uh when itcomes to stuff. It's theft. It's fraud.Plain and simple. Many AI arguments arenot technical. They are legal. Somepeople see some people companiesunderstand and only uh let's see onlythe stick or some people's company onlyunderstand with the stick. I'm not sureif that's true. I'm not sure how much ofit is legal or not legal. Uh I thinkthat there's plenty of public uh publicdomain images that you can train off of.There's also uh AI programs that aretrained off of artists who opt in andgive their styles. Um and so like that'sthat's a thing people do that. And sothat's real. Also, I think this is Ithink this is a very interestingargument that we have to come to termswith, which is legal don't matter to toChina, right? There's there's a lot ofthings that you're going to have to kindof think about in the future. I don'tthink it's a I I think there's a lot ofreckoning and a lot of laws that areabout to happen. I just don't know what,how, where, and how do you approach it.It's just more very interesting. Allright. It is also worth noting thatthere are more things to think aboutthan efficiency and productivity. It'salso about doing what you love. If youlove coding, keep doing it yourself,even if the computer might be better atit. True. And if you like makingproducts and you don't really likecoding, then it's probably better totrade-off to use something that makesthe code for you. Right? In 1997, DeepBlue won the chess match against theworld chess champion Gary Kaspor uhKasporov. Yet people still play chess.When it comes to programming, I' I'd saythat I program for the same reasons thatpeople still play chess. Though chessand software development are verydifferent with chess being much morelimited inscope. True. Uh I love just dunking onchess. Um, I think it is good to keep inmind that sometimes we can do thingsjust to enjoy them. True. My advice tonew program, I like this statement, bythe way. This is a good statement. Youcan just do things because you likethem. There doesn't have to be some sortof monetizing outcome to it. And youknow what the best part is? Sometimesmonetization happens at the end. Likegood things happen at the end, but itdoesn't have to be the strict motivationfor it. My advice to new programmers,don't become a forever junior who letsAI do all their work. If you want tobecome a programmer, learn to programyourself. Be curious. Just let's see.Put in the time and effort to learn howthings really work. Yeah. TJC course onboot.dev. My HTTP course on boot.dev.Just saying. Good ways to start learningsome backbone stuff and how things workin the layer below that. It really paysoff. Learning how everything works underthe hood. And using that is amazing.Just keep learning. Don't be a promptengineer. Even if you call thatengineering, believe me, it's more funto be competent. I love this term.That's by That's a DHH one. DH DHH. DHH.DHH. Yep. Boom.It is just more fun to be competent.Let's go.DHH. Let's go. He's a fact. Fact oflife. It is more fun to be competent.Called it. Oh yeah. That's because thatis like that was like the greatest itwas the greatest interview of all time.DHH is just a just a legend, right? Justan absolute legend. Even though AI mightbe smarter than you. I don't think it isthat I don't think you can use the termsmarter. It's not smarter. It's notdumber or smarter than you. Neverblindly trust the AI output. Don't buildyour whole workflow around it. Sometimestry to work uh without it for a fewdays. I like the airplane test. If youcan't program what you're doing on anairplane, I you don't know it. Like ifyou can't turn off the internet, sit onan airplane, sit uncomfortably, be takencompletely out of your workplace, workon a little laptop computer, and youcan't be efficient in work. I don'tthink you have a good setup. The betterat programming you are, the more AI willget in your way for the more complexwork. If you learn to code now, keepbuilding your skills instead of lettingAI do all the heavy lifting. You arecapable of fixing the messes that vibecoding is now creating. I don't want tosound elitist, but if you don't want tolearn to go beyond vibe coding, maybecoding isn't for you because positionswhere all work can be done by vibecoding are the ones that will beeliminated first when AI becomes morepowerful. Also true. Good trueing rightthere. That's actually a prettyhilarious observation. Vibe coding vibecoders will be the first to beeliminated as they get more as they getmore powerful. if and remember if youcannot code without AI you cannot codealso great statement but I do mean thatthe airplane thing I I don't say that aslike some sort of jer like oh you justdon't understand how to program it'sbecause your best thoughts will comewhen you are limited and you're justsitting there and you're just thinkingnothing's interrupting you nothing'swriting code for you nothing is doinganything for you it's just you yourcomputer you're trying something you'rethinking you're trying something you'rethinking it's completely blank of allother distractions and all of a suddenyou'll come up with like your best ideasand that's because you've actually hadtime to allow inspiration to happen. Youcannot be inspired when you'reconstantly interrupted, right? It's justlike the constant forever. It justdoesn't work. Honestly, I I' I've alwayshated that. I've always hated thatargument. Oh, well, just you got like,you know, thesyntax is like the like what what do youmean? If syntax is the barrier for youto understandprogramming, it's like brother, thesemantics is way harder. It's way, way,way, way harder than the syntax.Universally, all modern languages giveyou great output when you goof somethingup. Okay, shots fired at CO. I That'swhy I said modern. Okay, this dude gotone guy hard. I did, but I but it's justlike such a common one guying. It's sucha common one that people say thisconstantly like, \"Oh, something aboutsyntax.\" And I always just get so blownaway that syntax is the barrier. Likesyntax is just not the barrier. It's nothard. Anyways, conclusion. When you'reusing AIS, you are sacrificing knowledgefor speed. Sometimes it's worth makingthe trade-off. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.You should know when to do that. I thinkthis article is a little heavy-handed onwhen you should and shouldn't do it. Um,I think that you just got to figure outwhat you like the best and the reasonswhy you program. At the end of the day,I don't think there's a solid answer. Idon't think there's like I don't lookdown on the person that just vibe codeseverything. I just wouldn't I justwouldn't work on their projects. And ifsomeone's like, \"Here's $1,000. Couldyou fix a bug?\" I'd say no. I just I Idon't want to be I don't I don't evenwant to be a part of it. Unless if I canprompt my way also and spend uh 30minutes doing it or else I don't wantanything to do with your code. Like yourcode is trash and I don't want anythingto do with it. That's it. Right? I don'twant to have to deal with your crap.Right? I'm more on the implication sideof things. as long as you're long as atthe end of the day the code looks goodand you've done a goodjob like I don't care how you made itright. Uh though it is important toremember that even the best athletes inthe world are still doing their basicdrills for for a reason. Yes. Yes. Thisis good. Uh the same applies to softwaredevelopment. You need to practice thebasics to be able to do the advancedwork. You need to keep your axe sharp.We are still a long way out from AItaking over our jobs. A lot of companiesare creating FOMO as a sales tactic toget more customers and or raise money toshow traction to their investors to getanother round of funding to generate thenext model that will definitelyrevolutionizeeverything. AI is a tool. It is not goodor bad in itself. It's what you do withit. You know, they say it's not the sizeof the tool that matters. It's not thesize of the parameters that matter. Uh Ido think it can be a great tool as longas you are not reliant on it for yourworkflow. Uh make sure you still canwork effectively without it. Make sureyou don't push code to production thatyou don't fully understand and don'tthink of AI as a replacement for yourown thinking. Stay curious, keeplearning. I think this is one thing thatuh cursor did really really well whichis like I think Devon made the bigmistake and I think cursor did not makethe big mistake. Cursor goes engineersare going to be around. We're going tomake it easy to use AI. Devon said,\"Engineers aren't going to be around.We're going to replace them. We're goingto make it easy for you to to use LLMs.\"And they're two distinct schools ofthought. The Devon one, I think, isbuilt and predicated on this idea thatAI is going to improve at this reallycrazy rate. Cursor is built on this ideathat increased conveniences will makeyou use it more, but you are still theone in control. I think Devon ultimatelyis not going to be successful unless ifthere is anintense change in the power of LLM tothe point where it actually makes itpossible to vive code uniformly for allproblems or B cursor is going to be thesuccess because it has the good tabbingit hasuh it has better integration and a lotof people are going to just rely on itfor a lot ofcoding right Devon got replaced by AIunironically Devon got replaced by AI.All right. Hey, I like the article. I Ireally I I really did like the uh theTesla one and just the emphasis on a lotof small pract like a lot of practicingthe little things make you good at thebig things. And I think that that's theshortcut a lot of people want to find. Ithink this is just like you see it inkids. If anyone in here has raised kids,it's the number one problem of a lot ofkids is that the small things they don'twant to do. It's the big thing. Peoplealways want to do the big thing. Why canI not do the big thing? Why can I notlead the big thing? Why can't I do that?You know, but if you watch Euro Dreamsof Sushi, the people that he brings onto help make the world's greatest sushihave to spend three years making rice.Just making rice. That is it. Because tounderstand the process in the mostintimate possible way, you have to dosomething over and over and over andover and over and over and over againuntil the point where you just get it sodeeply that it's like a completelydifferent understanding of what you get.And so therefore, it's a message lost ona lot of people because people don't getthat there's layers of knowledge.There's not just knowing the thing.There's like a deeper knowing the thingand why it's good, but not just simply Ilike some things I know aboutprogramming I cannot write into a book.You cannot write into a book. It justexists. It exists within you. And evenif you try to write them down, it'snever going to come out correct. thename is I feel like I was halfwaythrough my sentence and I stopped. Yeah,it's intuition is the is the term you'relooking for, but it's like it's it'smore than intuition. It's it's also it'slike it's these sequential logical jumpswith the gaps being filled in byintuition. So, it's not just simply, oh,I think this is better. It's like thisis better because if I think about thisnext thing, I think this will be betterhere and then if I think about the nextthing, the next thing. It's like playingchess on top of programming that makesit end up so good. It's not just onesimple jump. It's the many jumps inbetween. Right. Anyways, it's fingerspits and fragle. Yes, exactly.",
    "summary": "The video \"Prime Reacts - Why I Stopped Using AI Code Editors\" centers around the speaker's experience with AI-powered coding tools and his decision to revert to a more manual approach. Initially, he was impressed by the capabilities of LLMs, particularly for tasks like debugging C++ code. He used AI tools extensively but found that his own competence in software development began to atrophy. This realization stemmed from an analogy to using Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature, where reliance on automation diminished his driving skills.\n\nThe speaker argues that constantly relying on AI to generate code can hinder the development of crucial \"fingerfeel\" – the intuitive understanding and finesse gained through repeated practice and problem-solving. He emphasizes that while AI can boost speed and productivity, it shouldn't come at the cost of fundamental programming skills. Vibe coding, while seemingly efficient, might not prepare developers for complex projects, legacy systems, or situations where AI tools are unavailable or ineffective, especially in domains like security.\n\nUltimately, the speaker advocates for a balanced approach. He still uses AI tools for specific tasks, such as converting code or learning about obscure topics, but prefers to maintain manual control over the codebase and decision-making process. He also notes that it's worth doing what you enjoy, even if AI could do it faster. He concludes by advising new programmers to prioritize learning core programming skills and to avoid becoming overly dependent on AI, as true competence and the ability to solve complex problems are more valuable in the long run. He also brings up that it is more fun to be competent, and it is more fun to find solutions to problems by your own brain."

where we design our loadbalancer i'll have oculus the actualcode ofa toy load balancer and understand howpcb connections are managed and howsimple it is to build load balancer thenweek four is about all about socialnetworks week five is all about buildingyour own storage indents like we'llbuild that intuition on if you were toever design your storage agent how wouldyou do that right then week 6 is aboutbuilding high throughput system 7 isabout buildinguh ir systems basically informationretrieval systems and adobe designswhere we design our own message brokerslike sqs where we design distributedtasks scheduler and we conclude thecourse with week 8 where we talk aboutthe super clever algorithms that haspowered or that has made those systemspossible right i have also attached avideo verbatim as is from my first quotewhere we designed and scaled instagramnotifications i will highly encourageyou to check this video out right andnow back to the videoso say we are building a multi-userblogging application in which we havethe blog service and the analyticsservice block service owns the block dbin which all the information about allthe blocks ever published on theplatform existanalytic service is the one thatunderstands likes views happening on theblock and it wants to update it in thedatabase now there are two ways to do itanalytic service can talk to the blockservice and block service can update itsdatabasesecond approach is that analyticsservice has the access to the blocksdband it can directly update the databasethe second approach that i justmentioned is the one that talks aboutthe sharing the database pattern wherethe database which is the blocksdb isshared between the block service and theanalytics service this is the simplestway to integrate microservices to havemicroservices coordinate and communicatebetween them right and is one of themost common approaches used across theindustry right there are a few verysolid advantages of using this patternfirst of all it's the simplest way ofintegration no complex things requiredlike directly two services talking to adatabase and you are done right nomiddleman involved so now there is noneed for an analytic service to talk toblock service and block service updatingthe database if you have this middlemanit not onlyimproves your it not onlyaffects your development time butintegration practiceshttp grpc so many complications and allwhat if one team understand grpc otherteam doesn't then that team needs toupgrade themselves to understand grpcand all of those complications happenthere is no latency overheadlike because there is no extra networkhop your analytic service as soon as itgot data can directly update it in thedatabase so no latency overhead rightquick development times now becauseanalytics can directly write to thedatabase like they are workingindependently they know the data theyknow the schema they would directlyupdate the database sothere is no cross-team effort requiredover here analytic service can choose tolike quickly develop things and putthings into production like update themetadata into the blogsdb and whatnotright so quick development timesthen simpler operations like ifyour analytics service was talking tothe block service and let's say thecommunication is happening or persistenttcp connections then someone had tomanage the tcp connection poolthen seeyour servers are scaled up see ifeverything works fine see if there areno network doors backlog syncs and whatnot instead your analytics service isdirectly talking to the database so noproblem there no extra overheadoperations are pretty simple bothservices talking to the same databaseand done right so pretty pretty simpleon the operation side and moreimportantly better performance becausethere is no middleman there is no extranetwork hop that is happeninganalytic service is directly updatingthe database block services directlyreading from the database so overallperformance looks super solidso this as an approach has massivemassive advantages keeping things simpleeveryone is happy teams are working veryquickly right so it's a win-win foreveryonebut apart from all of these advantagesthere are fewrather four key disadvantagesnot really but four key challenges thatyou would have to always keep in mindwhen you are adopting this pattern itmay not be suitable across all use casesbut even for a minor use case if you areadopting this patternwhere two serviceswill be sharing the same database bothof them having the read and write accessto it then what four things you shouldbe thinking about the first challenge isexternal parties are getting internaldetailsso here what is happening is becauselike the database is owned by the blocksteambut analytics team wants to update atotal likes into the database soanalytics team needs to understand theschema needs to understand how the datais stored needs to understand theintricate details of it of thisparticular db so that it can correctlyplace the information in the right tableat the right spot otherwise it would bea massive mismatch onto users andbecause block service is expecting it tobit some place but analytic service isputting it into a different place somajor complications might happenso by sharing a database with anexternal party here analytics is anexternal partylike it needs to get the internal schemaand other implementation details likefor example implement details like arethey using soft deletes or heart deletesis the database normalized or not is thedata redundant or not right so thosekind of details analytics team would beable to deduceout of this database which might not bethe best thing because why should theybe caring about this partright so it's always better to haveas safe distance as possible from allthe interfacing teamsand not let them know the internaldetails of the things right second iswhere what if the block service thinksof changing the schema because analyticsservice or analytics teamknew that the schema was in a certainway now if you as a blog stream want tochange the schemanow analytics team needs to change theirquery need to change their code base toadhere to the new schemaandto do that the biggest problem herewould be thatanalytics team would need to change itslogic uhand the block stream needs to ensurethat the changes are always backwardcompatibleso that the transition is smooth nowunnecessarily what is happening isbecause a service like analytic servicewas dependent on the same database theblock service who the blocks team whoowns the database is not able to quicklymake those alterations into it thatmight give them better performance orbetter maintainabilityand but they would have to wait on theanalytics service to make thosesentences keep them in the loop and getthose things done so this sort of tightcoupling might not be the best decisionfor the overall autonomy of the blocksteam because they are always dependenton the other team like hey they need tobe informed they need to give a go ateven though blocks team own it but theyare dependent on that so this reducesthe development time and just one keypoint before we move to the secondchallenge is what if your blocks teamtoday like we know that hey relationaldatabase works well till the certainstage but now that let's say we aregetting millions of hypothetically let'ssay we are getting millions of articlesone database is not able to support itso you want to shard it or you want tomove from sequel to nosql because nosqlgives you by default sharding right sogiven thatblocks team independently cannot makethe decision because analytics queriesmight get impacted so there is no clearautonomyof howuhof how block service can operate theyare always dependent on the analyticservice tolike before making any changes theywould have to take a nod from them so itit's not truly an autonomous system likethere is a very strong coupling betweenthe blogs and the analytics so notreally a gooddesign or not really a good high levelpattern that we talk aboutsecond challenge is sharing the databaseis equal to sharing the business logicso now for example to render aparticular dashboard or to render aparticular data onto the interfaceyourservices needs to fetch data from t1from tables t1 t2 t3 and t4 right andthisinformation is needed by all the threeservices blogs analytics and let's say arecommendation service right now thelogic oflogic to fetch this information isimplemented by all of them it's not thatonly one service is implemented becauseall of them are talking to the databaseand the services are not talking to eachother directlythis thelogic the business logic to get thatparticular information has to bereplicated across all the three servicesnow this nowlet's say block service made some changenow it says that hey now in order tofetch this information instead of usingtables t1 t2 t3 t4 use tables t1 t2 t7and t4so when this happensyour analytics service and yourrecommendation service would need tochange that business logic at their endand redeploy their servicesunnecessarily like it should have been avery smoother transition where theyshould have been there they should noteven have known what's happening behindthe scenes but now because they are allsharing the database if anything changesor any business logic changes thesefolks needs to update their logic anddeploy their changesso here what we are doing is what we arelosing is we are losing on cohesionwhat we wanted is all the services orall the components that are very tightlycoupled or they were wherein order to scope your micro service youshould always be thinking hey are thesecomponentsuh independent enough to be separatedif they are not then you should keepthem together here these threecomponents seem very separate like threevery different use cases but stillbecause they are sharing the samedatabase there is verythere is verything that the services needs to beknowing the business logic and andchanging the business logic according tochange happening on one of the serversor the team that owns the service sopretty messy situation over there rightso although we talked about twochallenges but the first two challengesthat we talked about are directlyimpacting the core principle behind themicroservice soin order to like in the previous videowe talked about how to scope a microservice and the two things we talkedabout is loose coupling and highcohesionthe first challenge is actually breakingon loose coupling because you are havingvery tight coupling because they aresharing the database and the second oneyou are losing high cohesion becausethree services that seem to be tightlycoupled are not and business logic needsto be changed but you cannot keep themat the same place so pretty messysituation over here so we are losingboth by sharing the dbthe third challenge is risk of datacorruption and deletionso here what would happen is becauseevery service blocks analytics andrecommendation all of them have read andwrite access onto the same database whatif due to a buggy script or due to awrong scriptanalytics ran a script and it deletedthe data from the blocks tv permanentlyor it corrupted it corruptedthe datanow when that happensit affects not only the block servicebut end user directly it may lead tocascading failures and basicallycascading impact across other servicessohere when youwhen you are sharing the database acrossmultiple services you have tounnecessarilyadditionally take care of database levelaccess control list to ck hey andbecause analytic service needs to updateonlyrows in this particular table analyticservice should get access the userthrough which analytics services talkingto the blocksdb should have access onlyto that table now recommendation servicemight not need to update something intothe database let recommendation serviceonly have read userlike those sort of complications come inas soon as you start sharing thedatabase just so to prevent datacorruption and data deletion right thefourth and the final challenge bysharing the database isyour shared database can be abused veryeasily say your analyticsyour analytic service has written a aquery and this query is very expensivevery expensive as in super heavy withrespect to the number of tables it joinsthe amount of data it computes and so onand so many things so when that is therewhen analytics teamfire that particular query your blog'sdb starts to choke upbecause your blocksdb starts to choke upwhat would happen is it would reduce orit would impact the performance on themain block serviceand the recommendation service soanalytic service is putting additionalpressure into your blog's database whichis shared across three services sounnecessarilythe three all the three services aregetting affected by because of onebecause of one serviceand now you'll say hey can we not ratelimit but how will you rate limit a dbquery where is the rate limiter like youare directly connecting to the databaserate limiter would have come into thepicture or rationing would have comeinto the picture when all the things allthe requests would have gone through acentral service let's say if analyticstalks to blogs and blogs talks to thedatabase and recommendation talks toblogs and blog stocks to database we canapply rate limiting over here ensuringthat no service is abusing the shareddatabasebut when the three services are givenprivileges to talk to the databasedirectly any one service of you can likebecause of a buggy script because of abug because of what not can actuallyabuse the entire system and can let theentire system get affectedright given that these are the fourchallenges does this mean that we shouldnot be using shared database pattern nothere is the problem like most peoplelook at every problem as black and whiteproblem or right or wrong no it's neverlike that in any design in any systemyou ever designyou need to know what are the strengthsof that approach and what are theweaknesses of that approach so here ifthe weaknesses is something that we canlive bythe strengths are immense like becauseit's give you quick development timequick access direct control and whatnotright sowhat are the possible places where youcan actually usesharing a database pattern first of allit's a very quick solution so forexample if you're starting up you have avery small team why would you want tospend time building microservicestalking to that and then talking to dbdon't add those over complications so ifyou're having if you're operating on asmall and lean teamnever think of optimizing it on themicro services part inter servicecommunication and whatnot not worth thetime and the effort right sodoing this analytics to blocks andblocks to db takes time teamcoordination and all of that so veryslow so it would make things slow sowhen you want speed and agility sharethe database don't think too much aboutit add those necessary access controlsbecause you are a very lean team and youdon't know if your business is going tosurvive pick the one that suits yourcurrent needs rather than going for thebest practices overallsecond is when your schema doesn'tchange often like most of the situationsthat we talked about in the challengesit was more about changing the schemaright what if i want to change theschema move the database my blog streamcannot do it independently what if thereis no need what if you know that fornext three years we are not going tochange the database what if we know thatthe schema is not going to change to amassive extent where things are prettystable then why not why not share thedatabase it is so simple to share thedatabase and get those things up andrunning in a very short time rather thanthinking about hey pure microservicecommunication and other sort ofcomplicationsno need of doing thatright the third thing is read load canbe moved to a replica one of thechallenges that we talked about therewas one system abusing the otherdatabase when that is the use case orwherever basically that is a possibilitywhat you can actually do is instead ofnot adopting a shared database patternwhat you can actually do is you canactually fork out a read replica out ofyour main blocks db and let theanalytics query fire on the read replicaalthough there would be some lag lagwould be in a couple of secondsbut it would not affect other servicesso what you can do is you can move allthe read loadto this read replica while the mainblock db can take care of the criticalrates by the block service and therights happening by the block service sothis way your block service can stilloperate in isolationright without getting this affected ananalytic service with some basiclag can continue querying on the readreplicathis way your analytics service is happyyour blog service is happy and you aregetting very nice development time quickturnaround time no team coordinationrequired and whatnot like obviouslygiven that your schema is not changingoften right this way you reduce thedependency and you're stillbasically getting the benefits out ofsharing the database rather than losingon most of the stuffso yeah that is it four challenges uh ofuh sharing the database pattern and waysto mitigate them and when can you andmore importantly when can you actuallyuse this pattern and this is notsomething which is just theoretical likemost systems or most microservicesevolve this way where they first startwith sharing the database they even atscale they do share the databasein which they do not see massive changeshappening or the system is stable enoughand the system is not abusing they putsome basic checks in place and letuhmultiple services access the commondatabase that is the best way to havethose in like best and the quickest wayto have that communication so keep allof those things in mind next time whenyou are designing a system that nopattern is black or white no pattern isright or wrong you should alwaysthink about where can i exploit thispattern and what is the best for my usecase right so yeah that's it for thisone i hope youi hope i gave you a differentperspective to look atuh microservices communication patternespecially sharing a database where notto look at it as a wrong pattern per sebut just use it what floats your portalright so yeah that's it for this one uhif you guys like this video give thisvideo a thumbs up if you guys like thechannel give this channel a sub i postthree in-depth engineering videos everyweek and i'll see you in the next onethanks again",
    "summary": "The video discusses the \"Shared Database Pattern\" in microservices, where multiple services directly access the same database, bypassing intermediary APIs. While often considered an anti-pattern, the video argues that it can be beneficial in certain scenarios. It highlights advantages like simplicity, reduced latency and development time, simpler operations, and better performance due to the absence of network hops. However, the video also outlines four key challenges: external parties gaining access to internal implementation details, tight coupling reducing team autonomy, shared database leading to shared business logic and reduced cohesion, and the risk of data corruption or resource abuse by other services overloading the database.\n\nThe video then explores ways to mitigate these challenges and identifies scenarios where the shared database pattern can be advantageous. These include situations where a quick solution is needed, such as startups with small teams, when the database schema is relatively stable and unchanging, and when the read load can be moved to a replica database to prevent resource contention. In the last case, you can fork a read replica of the database and use that for analytic queries so that the main database is not impacted by other services. It emphasizes that no design pattern is inherently right or wrong, and the decision to use the shared database pattern should be based on the specific use case, considering its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe presenter cautions that the first two challenges, external schema access and business logic sharing, violate core microservice principles of loose coupling and high cohesion. The video emphasizes the need to consider the trade-offs and context before dismissing the shared database pattern entirely, suggesting it's a viable option, especially in early stages of development or when specific constraints are met."

    "transcript": "duel 1000 can you talk a bit more aboutwhat new and delete actually does andwhen to use themsure so we don't need new and delete onhandmade hero because we don't use anykinds of C++ features that need themthat need to use them but basically whathappens is you can think about therebeing sort of two steps to constructinga you can think about two steps to usingmemory right there's one there's likegetting the memory- there's initializing the memory andthen we might as well like those are thetwo steps but we could also throw instep three if we wanted to which isfreeing the memory right or I should saythis you know what if we're gonna throwthat in we might as well do four steps3d initializing the memory and forfreeing the memory right and so the wayto think about the things that you'retalking the things you're asking aboutnew and delete right is essentially ifyou look at this processthis is malloc right these two togetherare new this here is free and these twotogether are delete so basically whatc++ tried to do is it tried to formalizesteps two and three whereas C onlyreally formalized steps 1 and 4 okay sothis is C this is C++ to make these alittle more concrete let's suppose thatI have something here struct foo it hasan int bar in itokay and so if I want to make one ofthese that's not on the stack that isgoing to be dynamically allocated from aheap the C runtime library provides youwith steps 1 & 4 which is malloc andfree and what those do is they go to theheap and they reserve something of thissize and they return it to youso when you say foo star a equals mallocright size of oops size of foo you areasking to do step one which is toreserved us a place in the computer'smemory for a food right and you'd haveto cast it here in C++ but in C youwouldn't cast it because the cast isimplicit from void so if it would see itwould be this right but the memory yougot back is just garbageit just has whatever is in there rightit's not this step two was not done foryou and then later right you can imaginecalling free on a which is saying I nolonger need the memory that you got hereso put it back into the heat put it backlike let it be known that this part ofmemory doesn't have to be reservedanymore that's step 4 okay and that'sfree so that's what C looks like and sowhen you wrote C code you did this thenyou did whatever you want to do toinitialize the object like a bar equals5 right there's the initialization I'minitializing bar to 5 I use it and thenlater if I have some D initialization todo I do it in this case I don't have anybut you could imagine something morecomplicated there in fact I guess youknow what let me help illustrate this alittle bit better by saying instead ofint bar let's say it's file star barright so there's actually another thinginside it so an initialization time Iwant to do bar equals F open some filewhen I'm done with it right I then needto close it so I need an F close hereand I need to F close a bar beforefreeing the memoryright so again those are the steps twoand three right here's step one here'sstep two here's step 3 here's step fourand so what new and delete tried to doin C++ is standardize on this step as acouple so instead of one two three andfour being things where one and fourwere facilitated by the C runtimelibrary and two and three were entirelyup to you C++ makes it so that actuallythose things can be bound together so ifwe expand this class to have aconstructor foo right and a destructorfoo right and I'm calling it a structbut remember struct in class havethere's no difference between these twothings and C they don't they're exactlythe same the only difference is whetherthings are declared private or public bydefault that's it so if you stuck apublic at the top of this thing there'dbe no difference between calling toclass onus drugs so you know don't letthat confuse you they're literallythey're there it was a meaninglesskeyword it was should never have beenintroduced it doesn't actually meananything it's just a struct the onlything that we haven't seen CLS areStruck's and so class was just you knowsomeone's little mental you know Bironstrauss trip had a you know unhealthyattraction to stimuli or something okayso we introduced these constructors anddestructors and what they are designedto do is move the understanding of whatsteps two and three are into c++ properrather than just as something theprogrammer does so what we do is insidethese constructors right here's Foosconstructor inside the constructor weactually do you know bar equals F openright and inside the destructor for foowe actually do the F close okay right sothat's what's actually happening in thecase of in the case of doing the c++ wayso steps two and three move into theclass right they move they move in theresponsibility for that is no longer inthe outside it's on the inside of thestruct right and so the reason that c++had to introducenew and delete was because now youneeded a way of saying I want to do aMalick followed by the initialization Iwanted to do step one and step two andthat is what new means and similarly tobe symmetric they needed to introduce away to say I want to do step three andstep four and that is what delete meansright so the time when you have to usenew and delete is really very simple didyou want the compiler to call theconstructor did you want the compiler tocall the destructor or didn't you that'sit now it's worth noting that sometimesyou really don't have a choice in thisstruct that I have here it would betrivial for you to Balak it and just notyou don't have to call new even if it'sgot a constructor in it if you didn'twant the constructor to run you couldjust call malloc right doesn't matterbut suppose you were to introduce avirtual function heaven help you firstyou would get fired from my team butthen second what would happen is insidethis this struct foo the compiler wouldsilently introduce a pointer to what'scalled a V table which is a dispatchtable that is how it actually implementsvirtual functions right now you have noway of initializing that virtual tableyourself because you don't even knowwhere that you don't know anything aboutthat that's a compiler detail right andso one of the things new also does is itinitializes any hidden the informationthat you did not put there but thecompiler did and so if you start usingcompiler features C++ features that thecompiler needs to augment the structureof the class with and which haveimportant initialization that has tohappen you must call new even if youdon't care about the compiler callingyour constructor because the compileressentially has a constructor that hasto get called and it is theinitialization of that V table okayso yeah hopefully that gives you someperspective on what new and delete areand when you have to call them thereason we don't need to call them inhandmade hero is because I find them tobe completely superfluous and irrelevantbecause if I wanted a function that bothmalloc memory and initialized my thing Ijust write the function I just write afunction called a lock and in it and Ipass the print like new and delete areliterally two of the worst ideas I'veever seen I have no idea why they werewritten that way they don't make anysense to me at all they're really reallyreally stupidright the correct way to have added themto the language if you wanted to get thefeatures that you were going to getthere I think would have been to justhave a way of doing a stack call sosaying like the thing that this thingreturns is a stack call is on the stackyou know move semantics basically asthey call them nowadays probably wouldhave been the thing to implement becausethen you wouldn't ever care about theseat all but yeah so I never use thesebecause they're literally worthless inmy opinion I don't think they ever havea point but like I said if you everstart doing things like virtual functioncalls you don't have a choiceyou're gonna have to do them now mindyou you know then this kind of gets intoyou know C++ programming which I don'tcare about but like I said you know asmuch as I bag on other languages likeJava and C++ or whatever on the streamthat's just cuz I don't like that rightbut if you like them you should use themright you know there's people shouldprogram in the language that they wantto use so if you are someone who doeslike C++ and you're programming in C++again keep in mind you do have otheroptions here there's a thing called aplacement new write which is a way oftelling the compiler to generate thecode that it needs to generate toinitialize an object without allocatingthe memory right so if you want to justdo step two or just do step three youcan't actually do those and so if youweren't aware of that you know go readabout that that's something that ispretty important to be able to do if youwant to do sort of advanced memorymanagement stuff and seeI mean in C++ it's relevant",
    "summary": "The video explains the differences between `malloc/free` in C and `new/delete` in C++, focusing on how C++ attempts to standardize object construction and destruction. In C, `malloc` allocates raw memory and `free` deallocates it, leaving initialization and de-initialization (like opening/closing files) entirely to the programmer. C++ introduces constructors and destructors within classes/structs (which are nearly identical, differing only in default access modifiers) to encapsulate these steps. `new` in C++ performs both memory allocation (like `malloc`) and constructor execution, while `delete` executes the destructor and then deallocates the memory (like `free`).\n\nThe core reason for `new` and `delete` is to ensure constructors and destructors are called, particularly in scenarios involving compiler-generated code like virtual function tables (v-tables). If a class has virtual functions, the compiler secretly adds a v-table pointer that requires initialization. Using `malloc` directly bypasses this initialization, potentially leading to errors.  While you *could* malloc a simple struct and skip using the constructor, you *must* use `new` when the compiler adds hidden data requiring initialization (such as the v-table pointer). The speaker expresses strong opinions against `new` and `delete`, considering them poorly designed and advocating for manual memory management with custom allocation/initialization functions when feasible, as done in Handmade Hero. The video also briefly mentions placement new, which initializes an object in already allocated memory without allocation itself, offering finer-grained control over object lifecycle."

    "transcript": "hey what's up guys my name is HMO andwelcome back to my syphilis gloss seriestoday I'm going to be talking aboutvirtual functions in c++ over the lasttwo episodes we've been talking aboutclasses and object-oriented programmingand inheritance and all that stuff andvirtual functions are really reallyimportant to that whole concept virtualfunctions allow up to override methodsin subclasses so for example let's saywe've got two classes a and B B isderived from K many would be thesubclass of a if we create a method inthe a class and marketers virtual wehave the option of overriding thatmethod in the B class to get it to dosomething else as always this is bestexplained by an example so let's take alook and we're to create two clauseshere one's going to be called anti Zwhich is going to be our base class theonly thing this empty class is going tohave is a public method called get aname which is going to return a stringbecause this is just an entity we'rejust going to return the word entitynext we're going to create another classplayer which is going to be a subclassof the entity class we're going to add alittle bit more of this class firstlywe're going to actually store a namethen I'm going to provide a constructorwhich allows us to specify a name andthen we're going to give it a methodcalled get name which in this case isgoing to return this name the name thatis the member okay cool so let's take alook at how we might use this set uplet's see whether we create an ASCIIhere and I'm going to try and print theget name from that FC then I'm going tocreate a player I'll call this playerturn on and I'm going to print theplayer's name as well and I'm not goingto bother deleting these objects becausethis program tonus anyway there's nojust no use in doing that let's get at 5to write our code and if we look at theresults alright cool looks pretty goodwell as you've got show no printingeverything seems fine however everythingthat we've written here so far willcrumble if we decide to use a concept ofpolymorphism if I start referring to theplayer as if it was an entity that'swhere we run into problem so for exampleif I create a variable here calledempty which is actually going to beassigned to T which is of course apointer to a player type rightplayer however now I'm just referring toit as an entity if I print this so I'lldo entity get name if I run micro hereyou can see we get entity printinghowever we would have course expectplayer because even though we'rereferring to this entity as an entitypointer it is actually a player it's aninstance of the player class possibly abetter example is if we had a princenamed function which took in an entityand then here we just called see out andsee get name and I'll replace these withprint name a and print name P so nowwe've got seemingly one function whichtakes in any kind of entity of course soyou can see that we don't get anycompile errors when we try to pass in Pbecause P is an entity right player isan entity and all we're doing here iscalling the entities get name functionwhich we would expect to be this getname for our entity and then this getname for our player however if we runour code you consider to get entityprinting twice why is that that'sthere's incorrect there instanceshappening is because if we just declareour functions normally our methodsnormally inside our classes then when itcomes time to call a method is going tocall whatever method belongs to the typeand of course if we look at this printmain function it takes in an entitypoints off meaning that when we call theget name function inside entity it'sgoing to look at entity and just callget name that's it however we want C++to somehow realize that hang on a minutethe entity that I passed into here isactually a player so please call thisget name function that is where virtualfunctions come in virtual functions thatreduce something called dynamic dispatchwhich compile is typically implementedby our V table a V table is basicallytable which contains a mapping for allthe virtual functions but our base classso that we can actually map them to thecorrect overwritten function at runtimein the future I'm going to do a whole indepth video on how we tabled work andall that so stick around for that ifyou're interested but to keep it simpleall you basically need to know is thatif you want to overridefunction you have to mark the basefunction in the base bar as virtuallet's go back to our code and I'm justsimply going to add the word virtual tothe front of this get name function thatis in our base up in our entity class itmight not seem like much but thisbasically tells the compiler heygenerate a V table for this function sothat if it's overwritten you can pointto the correct function with this changelet's hit f5 to run our code and look atthatwe've got NC and shown on printingcorrectly now another thing that we cando that was introduced in tables of 11is actually marked this overriddenfunction with the keyword override rightover here this isn't required of courseyou can see that we just ran our codewithout that and it worked fine howeveryou should still do this it goes firstof all it makes it a little bit morereadable since we now know this isactually an overridden function but alsoit just helps us a little bit withpreventing bugs tutors like spellingmistakes and all that like for examplefive types get a name with a lowercaseand you can see we get an error becausethere's no such function in the base butfor us to override or if we try anoverride function that isn't marked asvirtual you can see it also gives us anerror so it's just something that helpsus out okay so that's basically what avirtual function is virtual functionsaren't free though unfortunately thereare two runtime costs associated withvirtual functions firstly we have theadditional memory that is required inorder for us to store that be table sothat we can dispatch to the correctfunction that includes a member pointerin the actual base path that points tothe V table and secondly every time wecall a virtual function we have to gothrough that table to determine whichfunction to actually map to which is anadditional performance penalty andbecause of these costs some people justprefer not to use virtual functions atall honestly in my experience I've neverencountered this to be so costly thatthat it would make any difference if Istopped using virtual functions sopersonally I use them all the timewithout any issue maybe if you are onsome embedded platform which hasabsolutely terrible performance andevery CPU slice accounts maybe thenavoid virtual functions but otherwise Ireally can't tell you not to use thembecause of performance because becauseit's just such a minimal impact that youprobably won't notice it at all hope youguys enjoyed this video on virtualfunctions if you have an expressioncomment just leave them below and I'llsee you guys next time goodbye[Applause][Music][Music]",
    "summary": "This YouTube video explains the concept of virtual functions in C++ and their importance in object-oriented programming, particularly with inheritance and polymorphism. The video begins by defining virtual functions as methods in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes (subclasses). It then presents a practical example with an `Entity` base class and a `Player` derived class. Without virtual functions, calling a method like `getName` on a `Player` object referenced as an `Entity` would always call the `Entity`'s `getName` method, not the overridden version in `Player`. This limits polymorphic behavior.\n\nThe core of the explanation lies in demonstrating how declaring the `getName` method in the `Entity` class as `virtual` enables dynamic dispatch, allowing C++ to determine at runtime which version of `getName` to call based on the actual object type. This is achieved through the use of a V-table (virtual function table), which maps virtual functions in the base class to their overridden counterparts in derived classes. The video also highlights the `override` keyword (introduced in C++11), which, while not strictly required, enhances code readability and helps prevent errors by ensuring that a function is indeed overriding a virtual function from the base class.\n\nFinally, the video acknowledges the runtime costs associated with virtual functions, including the memory overhead of storing the V-table and the performance penalty of looking up the correct function at runtime. However, it argues that these costs are usually negligible in most applications and should not deter developers from using virtual functions unless working on extremely resource-constrained platforms. The presenter advocates for using virtual functions freely due to their benefits in enabling polymorphism and more flexible, extensible code."

    "transcript": "so we all know most databases store thedata in B plus trees but how in thisvideo we answer this very question andgo through the evolution of storage froma naive implementation to an optimized Bplus tree we will talk about why therewas a need to use B plus trees how tabledata is actually stored in B plus treesand how is this tree serialized andstored on the disk but before we moveforward I'd like to talk to you about acourse on system design that I've beenrunning for over a year and a half nowthe course is a code based course whichmeans I won't be rambling a solution andit will not be a monologue at allinstead a small focused group of 50 to60 Engineers will be brainstorming thesystems and designing it together thisway we build a very solid system andlearn from each other's experiences thecourse is enrolled by 800 plus Engineersspanning 12 codes and 12 countriesingenious from companies like GoogleMicrosoft GitHub slack Facebook TeslaYelp Flipkart dream11 and many many manymore have taken this course and havesome wonderful things to say the courseis focused on Building Systems the waythey are built in the real world theywill be focusing heavily on building theright intuition so that you are ready tobuild any and every system out there wewill be discussing the trade-offs ofevery single decision we make just likehow you do in your team we cover topicsranging from Real Time textcommunication for slack to designing ourown toilet balancer to cricbuzz's livetext commentary to doing impressionscounting at scale in all we would becovering roughly 28 systems and thedetailed curriculum split week by weekcan be found in the course page linkedin the description down below so if youare looking to learn system design fromthe first principles you will love thiscourse I have two offerings for you thefirst one is the live cohort basedcourse and the second one is therecorded offering the Live code basecourse happens once every two months andwill go on for eight weeks while therecorded course contains the recordingsfrom one of the past cohort's assets ifyou are in a hurry and want to learn andwant to binge learn system design Iwould recommend going you for therecorded one otherwise the Live code iswhere you can participate and discussthe systems and its design life with meand the entire cohort the decision istotally up to you the course detailsprerequisites testimonials can be foundon the course page arpitbani dot meslash masterclass I repeat ad with manydot me slash masterclass and I wouldhighly recommend you to check that outI've also put the link of this coursepage in the description down below andI'm looking forward to see you in mynext cohortso we all know SQL databases are knownto store data in B plus trees right butit is true that even non-relationaldatabases they leverage B plus fees tostore the data for example mongodb doesthat mongodb stores The Collection dataon disk serialized in terms of B plus 3so their storage engine called wiredtiger does that now in this one what Iwant like to do is to build an intuitionaround why there was a need to introducea data structure like deepestry and howit is actually serialized and storedlike the data serialized and stored onthe disk now in order to do this let'sstart with something really simple andthen we see why is there even a need todo that nowlet's say the most simplistic way tostore data let's say I have a table Ihave bunch of rows in the table the mostsimplistic way to store the data is tostore it in a single file one row afteranother dead simple right now when youhave something like this when we storedata in a file sequentially one rowafter another literally one afteranother in a file let's see how insertworks now here just to think that when Isay row it does not just imply row buteven a document anything any entity thatwe are storing in the table could beplaced over here so SQL tables typicallycall it rows no not relational databasestypically call it documents and what notbut idea holds true across the databaseSpectra right so here what I would wantyou all to do is to focus on the needand the intuition rather than thespecifics then everything would makesense right okay so let's start withthat let's say I have a bunch of rowsover hereand I would want to insert a new row nowgiven that all the rows that I have isplaced in that file sequentially whichmeans one after another inserting a newrow inserting this new row at the end ofthe file is really easy you open thefile independently mode and add the rowat the end right but now for example weknow that relational database or mostdatabases store the data ordered byprimary key which means that let's say Ihave defined a particular column ID asmy primary key and I'm inserting Row 1 2then 5 then 4 and then 3. now I'll haveRow 1 2 and 5 inserted then I would whenI want to insert the row in betweenbecause the table is ordered by that forme to insert the row in the between whatwould I have to dogiven that I cannot just insert a linein middle of a file I just cannot dothat because when I would writesomething end between the offset theline does not Auto or the rowsautomatically would not move down thefile right that's not a classic problemon a disk based solution is right it'snot in memory buffer that we've seencode editor where we just hit enter andit adds a new line it's on disk storageso when I would want to write somethingin between it is definitely trying tooverride the existing content right thatI cannot do which means adding a newline in a file in between rows is not anefficient solution because now what we'dhave to do is every time the inserthappens I would have to first locate theposition at which I would want to insertthen copy all the lines all the rowsbefore that in a new file add this newline then copy the remaining file onthis new or basically copy the remaininglines in this new file and it this waymy insert becomes order and become everytime I am inserting something I wouldhave to create a new file that that'sthe only way to do it becauseif whenever you write at a particularlocation whatever is written at thatlocation in the file gets overratedright you cannot just insert in betweenin one file on any disk rightso that's the limitation number one andthat's why insert becomes order n okaynow let's take a look at how updatelooks likenow let's say I want to update Row threeright now in order for me to do that Iwould have to look for the row with ID3right so then worst case I would have todo linear scan acrossor the entire file and find the rowsthat and find the row that I'minterested in then once I discover thatrow I would start writing at thatspecific location and overriding thecontent now here are the challengesgiven my other rows are alreadyoccupying some space when I am writingsomething from this location startingfrom this locationI would have to write the number ofbytes equal to the width of this row Icannot go beyond that because as soon asI go beyond that I would be infringingin the location in the storage locationof the next row I'd be overriding thiscontact it cannot move automaticallyforward just like in ide in ID it canmove forward because it is Ram you'restoring that file in you are loadingthat file in Ram and then making theupdate when you press Ctrl s then itgets saved on the disk right here youcannot do that so if let's say thisnumber of bytes were 100 and if I wouldwant to write 120 bytes so 100 byteswould be written over here and 20 byteswould be written over here oh infringingin the space of the row id4 right so nowfor you to do an update you first haveto locate right and then assuming thatyou would be updating the exact samewidth you can start overwriting overhere but if you want to do more thanthis width you cannot do that you'd haveto create a new file enter like copy therows a similar to user copy the rowswrite this new row and then update andsorry and then this will copy the restof the rows right that's why file IO isso so interesting because it you justcannot do it intuitively right you needto know the constraints that you areplaying with right okay now let's say Iwould want to find the neuro because ineven an insert you wanted to hunt forlocation even in order you would want tohunt for location right so now let's seehow hunting for a location look like howdo you find one in the five for you todo that the only way to do it givenbecause basically given right now thereis no indexes even in case of indexesyou cannot do it efficiently if you gowith the structure but now here what youwould have to do is you have toliterally go through file row by row andsee the and find the row that you'reinterested in there is no way for you tooptimize it binary search you can do itbut when you have right set of indexesbut how we will take a look which iswhere B plus 3 comes in right but anaive implementation linear scan is theonly way to do it okay now anothercommon operation that you've seendatabases is range queries now rangequeries are quite popular like give meall the rows which are present in thisrange like let's say 1 to 100 right nowfor you to do it range queries you cando it onlyyou can do it efficiently in this casewhy because first of all let's say Iwant to find rows between 2 and 5. rightso I start from here I'd find the rowwith id2 I found this then I'll continueto iterate one after another until Ifind row five and then I would just Clubthe results and send it out to the userright so range queries are efficient butin order to find the first row itselfthe worst case is ordering you'd have todo a linear scan right so range queriesare once you find the first row then therange query becomes like a linear scanbut before thatthat complexity to find the first rowitself is ordering because it's a findone operation right so even find ouroperation is order and you would likenot getting enough performance out ofyour database not the final operationdelete right delete as you might haveguessed already when you are deleting aparticular row it's you would have tocreate a new file every time you deletegiven this knife implementation becausewhat you do is you'd create a new filecopy all the rows until you flick firstof all you'd have to find a row that youwould want to delete find one operationorder in worst case then you copy therows up until that location into a newfile right and then you skip that rowand then you copy rest of the rows overhere that's how your delete the rowbecause it's pile IO you cannot justdelete something without and not reclaimthe space because then you areeffectively occupying that row right soyou would anyway have to do it so allthe operations that we discussed areordering insert update find deleteeveryone is ordering so how does B plusT solve this problemso given that order and insert updatedelete cannot work well with in atransactional database it's notperformant enough we have to findanother solution which is where V plus tcomes into the picture nowwhat is a B plus now will not go intothe data structure B plus 3 willunderstand how B plus 3 is leverage soin case you don't know what B plus 3 isjust a Google search away but let metalk about how B plus fees are leveragedover here soin a table there are bunch of rows righta table consists of rows a collectionconsists of documents now when you haveall of these rows you Club these rows inone B plus three note so for exampleif one B plus 3 node that I have if itis 4 KB big which means I can store 4kilobyte of data in this one B plus freenodethen in that caseif my average row size or average rowdocument length average length of thedocument of the row is let's say 40bytes in a SQL table if I may call itthe schema that you have you definefixed width for every single column youexactly know the length of the row rightthat I am talking about if the length ofthe row is equal to 40 bytes and if my Bplus 3 node is 4 KB bigeach node will contain 4 KB divided by40 roughly 100 rows which means that inthis B plus 3 node the number of rowsthat I can put in is 100 rows so this isRow 1 Row 2 Row 3 Row 4 and so on and soforth right so this is exactly what Bplus 3 stores when it says that I am mytable is storing the data in B plus 3.this is the leaf node of B plus T whereyou are actually storing the rows of thetable right okay so nowtypically typicallythe why did I pick 4 KB as the size ofthis V plus 3 node in most typicalconfiguration the size of a disk blockis 4kb now what is this disk block whenyou do a disk IOyou read a write a delete do somethingon the disk the most granular width inwhich it is done is 4 KB it is basicallycalled as a disk block size so even ifyou would want to redo one byte from thedisk you cannot just read one byte youhave to read the entire disk block andthen pick the byte that you'reinterested in and then like theoperating system does this for you butin reality because your operating systemis reading that entire block that is themost granular width that you operate onthat entire one that entire 4 KB blockis red it picks one byte and discardseverything else now given this giventhat the most granular operation thatyou are doing is on 4 KB you keep thesize of a B plus 3 node equal to 4 KBwhich means whenever you are reading youare reading that one B plus 3 node asis Right which means you're effectivelyreading roughly 100 rows over here I'mnot going into nitty-gritty softwarelike exact structure but you get theidea right there are spaces allocatedfor pointers and all so it's not exactly100 rows a little slightly lesser thanthat but you get the idea right okay sogiven this is how my rows are structuredin B plus 3 nodes now B plus now mytable can be represented as a set of Bplus T nodes which are connected to eachother now how how are you connecting itfor example for exampleI have we know that one B plus 3 node asper our assumption 4 KB this block sizeequal to 4 KB size of B plus 3 node eachrow is 40 bytes so I can store 100 rowsright okay so given that I know thateach node can store 100 rowsI will have let's say I have 400 rows sofirst node will contain 1 to 100 secondrow will contain 100 1 to 200 third rowthird block third node would contain 201to 300 and then the final node wouldcontain 301 to 400. right okay now thesenodes can be present in any location onthe disk now what your database doesinternally it does not just allocate arandom disk block on it it has a properstructure in a file where it knows fromthis is this this particular block isthere from this offset to this offsetthis particular block is there I amdrawing it in a randomish way so thatyou understand this it might not besequentially arranged you cannot assumethat they are arranged one after anotherright okay that's why I'm just drawingit like this so that you don't fall intothe Trap and thinking that all of myrows are stored one after another theyare not they might be but need not beright okay now each node contains asmall pointer exactly a disk offset likeat this offset in this file this iswhere my this B plus 3 node is presentright it will show now this might not beindividual files this may be part of thesame file itself but in that file yousplit a file into different regions eeach of the same size this is the sameas 4 KB and you just note down theoffset of that and storing that offsetbecomes a pointer to that node assimilar to C where pointer is exactlythe address of the memory location herethe pointer is the offset in thatspecific this specific file right nowthis is exactly how your data is storedor your table data or your document datais stored serialized on the diskthese nodes become the leaf node of awave cluster you would have you youwould remember that the leaf node of theB plus 3 also stores the data this isexactly what they're talking about theseare the leaf nodes of my BP of my B plus3 which is actually storing the row datathat you haveright okaybut is this even making your insertupdate delete efficient now B plus 3does not just contain Leaf node right itcontains other nodes so what is storedin other nodes let's go through that asimple table when visualized as a B plus3 a very simplistic visualization foryou to understand the concept is this soB plus 3 may contain n levels I'm takingexample of three that becomes easier tounderstand now here this is the root ofthe B plus three node then you havefirst level and then you have the actualLeaf notes where the actual table datais stored right here you can see how ourtable data is stored in B plus 3 row orrather ID 1 to 100 101 to 200 200 to 1to 300 and so on and so forth are storedover here now let'ssee what each node holdsin B plus b now again each of these thisis a very nice visual way to see it onthis they might be spread anyhow rightin the table file it depends sodepending on the database what storageengine they are using for example MySQLDB has my SM inodb and whatnot they maychoose a different way to store this ordifferent way to allocate this B plus Tnode on the disk in that region we don'thave to worry about it that's theimplementation specific but in a nicevisual representation this is how we canvisualize it very easily now every Bplus 3 node is serialized and stored onthe disk so all of these nodes that youare seeing they are not stored in memorythey are all on disk they may be broughtinto memory for performance gain but theworst cases they are all stored on diskright okaynon-leaf nodes they hold the routinginformation when I say routinginformation it's not something nodesrouting what I'm talking about is ittells that in the child node which nodeholds what range of data for examplehere this node non-leaf node stores 1and 1 0 1 which means that the left nodestarts with one ID and the right nodestarts with id101 right here the leftnode starts with two zero one and rightnode starts with three zero one so from201 to 301 you can find it over this andso on and so forth right this is theoffset or the routing not offset but therouting information that the rangeinformation which might be the betterbut range information of what the leaveB plus P node holds and white so aslevel increases they keep holding therange information of their childright okay now for you to make anyinsert update deleteyou now you can very clearly see ohsorry before that before we go into theoperation side of things as always in Bplus three node will all the leaves areinterlinked or they are connectedlinearlylike each Leaf is connected like likethis they are linearly connected rightso the first note second note not reallylinearly connected and they are alsopart of the B plus feed now we'll seehow beautiful this solves a problemright okay Leaf node as I will discussedholds the actual rows these are row ID50150 but this is actual raw data andleaf nodes are connected linearly notnow let's take a look at operations howthis makes sense right let's start withfind one by ID operation find one likegiven an ID find me the row now for youto do that in order to in order for youto find a particular row with aparticular ID what would you need to dolet's say I would want to find row withid4 what will I do I'll start with theroot node now this node is present ondisk so first thing what I'll do is I'llgo to the disk read this particularblock I'll read this particular blockinterpret the routing information and Iwould know that id4 is present in thisrange I would go over hereand how would I know that I would juststore the the left and the right likethe least and the most value over themthrough which I'm writing like here 1and 1 0 1 is what I'm storing I'm notdon't want to store every single rowsinformation right because its range iswhat I'm operating oncorrect so now here I would haveinformation which is let me just be veryspecific on that I would store one2 0 1 and 4 0 1 kind of like thisinformation would be stored so thismeans that 1 2 2 0 1 if I'm requestingfor this ID I have to go over here ifI'm requesting something for 2 0 between2 0 1 2 4 0 1 I would have to go overhere four zero one greater than fourzero and I have to go over here rightthat's typically what we store in B plusright okay so now what do we do let'ssay we are requesting for row ID 3 rightso now what I'll do 3 lies between 1 and2 0 1. so it would first read this plotunderstand hey I'm looking for a threeit's present in between 1 and 2 0 1 soit would go to the first node here itwould say 3 1 and 1 0 1 it's over hereit would come over here and read so readthis block come over here then read thisblock from the disk read all thesehundred rowsagain it's a discrete it would read allthese hundred rows and find which one isrow ID3 get that and return it so nowwhat your linear scan was is now justboil down to one two and three discretethat's itwhere you are doing this multiplediscretes at first now it just boilsdown to three discretes and you get therow that you are interested indead simple right now here youbeautifully see no matter which row yourrequest you would get it in thisspecification in exactly three discreetsnot one extra one for this block one forthis block one for this block extractthis row and return it to the user rightthis is how your reads would work rightfind one by ID now let's take a look atnext operation which is insert now howwould insert work insert what we wouldfirst have to do is let's say I'd wantto insert row 4. what I will do readthis block understand where the four ywould lie in the leaf node I'd come overhere insert or find Row 4 where 4 wouldlie I'd find this I would read thisentire block find the place where I canplace the Row 4 it would be after 3 andbecause I'm loading it in memory I cando that Arrangement add something inbetween and move other forward right Ican do that array movement right you cando that if you are storing it in arraysyou put it in between and then flush theentire thing on the disk which means youread this you read this you read thisyou put your Row 4 and then you put itand you flush this B plus T node on thedisk so one disk read two disk readthree disk grid update in memory and onedisk flushright so this way you have your insertcan happen in between you don't have torewrite the entire file in linearsequential way that we were streaming wewould have to rewrite the entire filehere we don't have to here what we aregetting is we are getting this benefitthat without touching any other diskblock any other B plus pre node I amjust reading the blocks I am interestedin updating them and flushing it downright and obviously the B plus T isrebalancing and all comes into thepicture so that specifications of B plus3 as a data structure go through thatthat's out of the scope I'm talkingabout how database actually stores thedata right okay that's about to insertsimilarly you can Envision updates youread readupdate the row let's add one to updaterow 202 right let me take a differentexample update row 202 I would read thisI would know you come over here readthis I would have to come over here readthis in memory now I have the entiredisk the entire B plus reload in memoryI would update whatever I want to flushit down on the disk right if I want todo arrange and move it and whatnot I cando all of that but without altering anyother block I am just doing the updatesthat I'm interested I may have to splitand rebalance the B plus T that is adifferent problem but it makes myoperation so simpleright similarly when you are deleting itwhat you do let's not want to delete row401 I read this read this read this inmemory delete this block I haveliterally if it's I'm storing it in anarray I would just delete that part inmemory and then flush it onto the diskthe way I do it when I flush it the rowis gone and that's my hard duration thenI may have to rebalance the tree inorder to maintain the M by n factor thatyou know like standard B plus threepractices but now here you see howbeautiful your operation gets right sosimple so efficient without touchinganything else you get the raw power ofthe disk right the final operation Iwant to talk about is range query let'ssay I want to find all the rows whose IDline the range 100 to 600. now for youto do this see how beautifully that thatleaves that are connected that solvesthis problem so beautifully now let'sadd one to read Rose whose ID is inrange 100 to 600 right okay what I'll doI'll want to read 100 right so I'llstart from here where does hundred liehere I'll come over here where does 100lie over here so let's start from herefrom 101I read this block I'd say did I read 600no so then I have to read this block butnow instead of coming from here hereuntil here because this nodes areconnected like this you can linearlytravel through this so I read this andthey read this with this point I readthis until I reach 600.as another 8600 I stopped so now what weare doing with this leaves directlyconnected with each otherwhat you get is you don't have toiterate through this from top to bottomagain and again once you reach at theleaf you can just linearly Traverse likethisthat's the beauty of this data structurenow the number of discreets is one twothree four five six seven the bareminimum that you have to do login toreach to the first point and thenlinearly depending on the number of rowsthat you are reachingsuch a beautiful implementation that'swhy data structures this B plus 3 is soso so powerful because of this veryreasonwhy B plus 3 forces you to store data atthe leaf node now you get it B treesallow you to store data in the middle inthe in the non-leaf node also but B plusT forces you to store data in the leafnode this is precise lever because itmakes your range queries super efficientit gives you predictable times to readany Row from your database right this isthe power of B plus 3 and this is whymost databases out there they use B plus3 to store and hold their actual dataright and it's not just specific to SQLno SQL databases like mongodb in TheWire tiger storage agent they do thisright this is the beauty of B plus 3 andhow database and Y database stores thedata in B plus 3 and this is what Iwanted to cover I hope I really hope youfound it interesting now I think most ofyour questions around why database USBplus trees to hold the data would besolved but once again explore on this inbit more detail understand B plus threein case you are unaware right but thisis precisely why database USB plus T2store the data again I hope you found itinteresting I hope you found itinteresting amusing sorry and uh that'sit for this one I'll see in the next onethanks[Music]",
    "summary": "This YouTube video explains why databases store data in B+ trees, contrasting it with a naive file-based storage approach. The video starts with a promotion for a system design course. Then, it dives into the limitations of storing table data sequentially in a single file, highlighting the inefficiencies of insert, update, find, and delete operations due to the need for linear scans and file rewrites. Specifically, inserting requires copying and rewriting entire files, updating becomes difficult when row sizes change, and finding a row is a linear search.\n\nThe video then introduces B+ trees as a solution. It explains how table rows are grouped into B+ tree leaf nodes, typically sized to match disk block sizes (e.g., 4KB) for efficient disk I/O. The video further details how B+ trees are structured with root and intermediate nodes holding routing information, indicating which child node contains a specific range of data. Leaf nodes are linearly linked, which optimizes range queries. The video walks through find, insert, update, delete, and range query operations using B+ trees, showcasing the efficiency gains by reducing disk I/O and eliminating the need for linear scans.\n\nThe video emphasizes that B+ trees provide predictable read times and make range queries highly efficient because data is forced to exist at the leaf node. B+Trees help achieve these advantages by enabling targeted disk reads and writes without impacting unrelated blocks. The presenter points out that this approach is used in both SQL and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB using WiredTiger) because it addresses the limitations of naive sequential storage."

update a subscription layerto call subscribers on the main threaditself which eliminated a whole class ofcrashes and a bit of mental load I'm nottrying to be like look at these idiotsnot fixing an obvious issue with thecode base when it was obvious to mebecause it would have been obvious toanyone who thought about it for a fewminutes I had one of these recentlywhere I was helping a certainundisclosed application that had acertain massive Bill and a really slowsite on a certain service and when Ilooked at their code they had like fiveplus Prisma database calls on every APIendpoint all blocking even though theyhad no data in common so they had a bigawait block before you even start therequest just to get the user data thenthey had another giant await huge queryto get some more data then right afterthree more queries and I was able toForex their performance by just takingall those queries and putting them in apromise.all so that they could all runin parallel instead of individually do Ithink those devs suck I'll mence mywords but theoretically any of themcould have looked at and been like yeahthat's dumb we probably shouldn't do itthat way it's not that I am so muchbetter than those other devs it's justthat I've done it more I care a lot andI'm a fresh set of eyes on the code baseit's like yeah this should be better andas the author says here these thingstend to stick around a weird amountbecause there's never a natural time toaddress them I see this so oftenespecially with performance stuffbecause if your performance sucks whendo you fix it usually when it sucks sobad that it's causing problems and notuntil then when you're first gettingonboarded you're not trying to changeanything big I I an exception here I Ihave had times where I joined a codebase that was massive and I was likewait you guys aren't using prettier youguys don't have slint setup it's 2024and you're still writing this JavaScriptlike it's the the early 2000s and I'vehad times where my first poll request toa repo was like 100,000 line change andeveryone hated me but then a week laterthey liked me but yes you probablyshouldn't be trying to change anythingbig what you should be doing is readingthe poll request tab you know what I'mgoing to do I'm going to in parallelwrite my advice to younger Theo adviceto younger Theo and I expect this to bedifferent but have overlap in thelessons the first one I want to put inhere is don't learn a code base throughthe codetab start in the pr tab I've said thisfor a while and I'll continueemphasizing it when you're working on abig code base for the first time theworst thing you can do is start byreading the code because in a giant codebase the the vast majority of the codehasn't been touched possibly for adecade even 90% plus of the code in abig code base just doesn't get touchedand if you spend all your time trying toread and understand that code you'rescrewed but if you go and read a wholebunch of poll requests you see what ismerging what people push back on what ischanging and why it's changing yourunderstanding of that codebase will besignificantly better than if you justtry to read it line by line in fact ifyou had two people one who has read allof the code and one who has read halfthe poll requests I promise you the onewho's read half the poll requestsunderstands the code Bas significantlybetter than the person who seen everyline of code in it guaranteed yeah backto the article as they said when you'refirst getting onboarded you're nottrying to change everything andcertainly not anything big so you maythink it's weird but you shouldn't gochanging a bunch of things that you'restill learning about then when you'vebeen on the team for a while it sort ofjust Fades into the background I reallylike this framing because if you show upto a new code base and you're like thisseems wrong you're often too scared todo the right thing and then after awhile once you're comfortable it's nowbecome normalized to you that's a reallygood framing I had not thought of beforeand it's actually something I try toindex on when I'm running teams I'mgoing to add another point to my takeswhich is it's very easy to get into thestate where if somebody new is showingup on the project they haven't touchedit all before and they say hey thesethings are weird you're like oh don'tworry you'll get used to it but you'resaying that because you yourself areused to it it doesn't mean it's normaldoesn't mean it's good so what I'velearned to do is listen extra carefullywhen the dev shows up on the project forthe first time what stands out to themwhat went wrong in the onboarding whatwas unclear when they started readingthrough the code what made their firstpoll request hard to do you don't getthat feedback from your existing devsbecause they're all stock homed into itso the only way you can actually improveon those metrics is by taking massiveadvantage of the unique opportunity of aDev trying out your code base and tryingto contribute to it for the first timethat's a rare experience and if you wantit to be better for the next Dev listenvery carefully to the current one who'sonboarding right now and I I couldn'tagree more that this is super commonthat devs are scared to make the bigchange based on what they expect andthen by the time they have theconfidence is too normalized and theymove on it's a mindset shift you justneed to occasionally remind yourselfthat you are capable of making you andyour team's life easier when these sortsof things are hanging around absolutelyabsolutely agree first there's actuallya good question here do you worry thatperson is coming in and trying to makewhat is comfortable to everyone elsemore comfortable for them or whatthey're used to seeing that's aconversation to have but chances are ifyou're showing up and you've worked inother code bases especially at a companylike I when I was at twitch I touchedlike probably 20 plus code bases in ameaningful way and when I was working onmost of them the tooling was relativelyconsistent there was obviously lots ofdifferences between them but then when Iwould show up in another code base froma different team be like oh you guys arejust behind the standards of the rest ofthe company can I propose some changesto make these things a little more insync and usually a couple do would pushback but a few others would be like yeahI worked on two other code bases hereand those were better we should havethat here too and as long as you canbuild a few allies and have a goodconversation these changes are almostalways worth doing and talking aboutback to the article assess the trade-offthat you're making between quality andpace and make sure it's appropriate foryour context Banger after Banger damnthere's always a trade-off betweenimplementation and how confident you areabout correctness so you should askyourself how okay is it to ship bugs inmy current context if the answer to thisdoesn't affect the way you work you'rebeing overly inflexible what a bangerGod coming out stronger than even me onit what a way to say unit tests areuseless if they're useless to you soyeah obviously I agree I think that theway you write software that failureswould kill people should be verydifferent from the way you writesoftware where failures mean they don'tget a fancy Emoji when they hit a buttonquite as fast as they would otherwiseit's important to recognize the thedifference in these types of thingswhere certain Services should never failever and if they do people die and thenthere's other services like especiallyin the startup world where asunintuitive as it may seem failuresmight actually be somewhat good aninteresting thing we learned when wewere running ping is that if we had twocustomers one had no issues they signedup and everything went well and then onecustomer had some issue big smallwhatever and they report it to us if wefix that issue for them fast enough andwe get them involved in the conversationso they feel listened to understood andcared for the customer that had the bugwill be more loyal than the one whodidn't so if we had built everything ina way where it's harder to write bugs wemight have had less happy customers noteven accounting for the fact that if weslowed things down enough to never shipbugs we would never have shipped a lotof the features that our users wantedand if they did still run into bugs itwould have taken us even more time tofix them so ignoring all of that havingbugs was still better in our context inscenario we making Medical where thatwould not be the case we're making asilly app for streamers to collaboratevery different use case very differentresults very very different context andyou should adjust the way you work basedon that context couldn't agree more atmy first job I was working on Greenfieldprojects around data processing whichhad good systems in place forretroactively reprocessing data theimpact of shipping a bug was very minorthe proper response to that environmentis to rely on the guard rails a bit movefaster because you can you don't need100% test cover or an extensive QAprocess which will slow down the pace ofDev at my second company I was workingon a product used by tens of millions ofpeople which involved high valuefinancial data and personallyidentifiable information even a smallbug would entail a postmortem I shippedfeatures at a snails pace but I alsothink I may have shipped zero bugs thatyear usually you're not at the secondcompany I've seen a lot of devs air onthe side of that sort of programmingthough I couldn't agree more even when Iwas at twitch I found a lot of teamstrying to meet like Amazon's reliabilitystandard it's twitch I lovedworking at twitch it was a great companybuilding awesome things and I'mstreaming live on Twitch right now bythe way every Wednesday live on Twitchif you want to see how I record thesevideos and hang out and chat with myhomies here twitch is a great place towork twitch is a really cool producttwitch does not need to have six NES ofreliability and if that results in ashipping worse features slower it's amistake and the fact that we had suchinsane code coverage rules was justobnoxious it actually resulted in us notshipping things well pretty regularly astory I tell a lot because it haunts meis that we had I think there was 80 or90% code coverage as a rule I had afeature that we rewrote to be about atenth as much code so we had the oldversion which was let's make up numbersum let's say 100,000 lines of code andwe had the smaller version which was10,000 lines of code both are probably10x smaller doesn't matter the 100,000line of code version had code coverage abit over 80% the 10,000 line of codesmall version had code coverage at 100%both were in the project because it wasfeature flagged so you'd get one or theother we had moved 100% of users over tothe new one the new one was faster ithad new features users liked it moreyou're ready to go okay so it's time todeprecate the old one to delete that100,000 line of code mess I never coulddelete it because deleting it put usjust below the code coverage thresholdeven though the feature I replaced itwith had better code coverage it didn'tmatter because the pure number of linesof code that were tested being removedwas enough to just barely drop us underthe threshold and I would not besurprised if that giant pile of unusedcode still existed in the twitch codebase simply because deleting it hurt ametric that didn't matter for a productwhere people can play games and talk toeach other that is every layer of thatis stupid every single one and even if Iloved working at twitch that's justproof of how dumb this is the only codecoverage number that's acceptable is100% And even that is dumb too yeah I Idigress anywayas they were saying usually you're notat the second company I've seen a lot ofdevs air on the side that of that sortof programming though in situationswhere bugs aren't Mission critical whichis 99% of web apps totally agree you'regoing to get further with shipping fastand fixing bugs fast than you wouldtaking the time to make sure you'reshipping pristine features on your firsttry totally agree and I also agree thatgood test should not think about codecoverage percentages but if you're goingto enforce one the only percentage ofcode coverage that makes any sense atall is 100 still doesn't make much sensebut at least it makes some a less than100% number nonsense useless throw itaway next Point spending time sharpeningthe a is almost always worth it Prime isgoing to love that one you're going tobe renaming things you're going to betyping type definitions finding rereferences Etc a lot and you should befast at this you should know all of themajor shortcuts in your editor youshould be a confident and fast typistyou should know your OS well you shouldbe proficient in the Shell you shouldknow how to use the browser Dev toolsefficiently and effectively I can canalready tell people are going to be inthe comments like you can't just spendall day tweaking your neovim config Imean if you become a YouTuber that talksabout neovim you can but I digresssometimes you need to chop the tree tooI don't think I've ever seen someoneactually overdo this though one of thebiggest green flags I've seen in newEngineers is a level of care in choosingand becoming proficient with their toolsyou knowwhat fine my issue is never thatsomebody's really excited about NE ofmis when they shame others for being lessexcited if you want to go all in on NEand really care about the coolingexperience that you have A+ if you'regoing to make fun of me for saying vscode is good enough get off my teamthat's my line also on that note beforeI forget I went through this phase so Ican talk all the I want I stillspent a whole summer at Amazonconfiguring my I3 t-u neovim everythingbecause I wanted to be a real legithacker so I could feel less like animpostor and learning those skillshelped me a ton I got way better at insand outs of navigatingcomplex developer environments that allsaid once I got a Macbook I kind of justdrifted towards full screen vs code andI've been happy with it since but like Ihad to do my time in the trenches of acrazy complex developer experience setupthat I owned all of and was reallyconfident in before I could make thatshift with similar confidence where Ijust live in command Tab and Tilda andas you guys can see I have very littlestuff open cuz I don't need to have awhole lot of stuffopen next point you can't easily explainsomething is difficult then it'sincidental complexity which is probablyworth addressing I love that I love thispoint if you can't say why it's complexyou should fix it like this is hard isnot a good answer this is hard because Aand C where those things are simplethat's a good answer my favorite managerin my career had a habit of pressing mewhen I would claim something wasdifficult to implement often hisresponse was something along the linesof isn't this just a matter of sendingup X when we y or isn't this just like Zthat we did a couple months ago veryhighlevel objections is what I'm tryingto say not on the level of the actualfunctions and classes that we weredealing with which is what I was tryingto explain I think conventional wisdomis that it's just annoying when managerssimplify things like this I know I'vepissed off a lot of people doing thatbut a shockingly high percentage of thetime I'd realized when he was pressingme that most of the complexity I wasexplaining was incidental complexity andthat I could actually address that firstthus making the problem as trivial as hewas making it sound this sort of thingtends to make future changes easier aswell I'll drop the hot take of this iswhy I like react and a lot of the newreact stuff is once you stop thinkingabout those details and you plan thesystem and make decisions around thedesign I actually find it to be mucheasier to both build and reason aboutand then longterm most importantly makesit easier to maintain these are all goodthings try to solve bugs one layerdeeper ooh and react's already coming upoh boy imagine you have a reactcomponent in a dashboard that deals witha user object retrieved from state ofthe currently logged in user you see abug report in Sentry Sentry plug Channelsponsor they're not sponsoring thisgreat product for debugging stuff thoughyou see a bug in Sentry where user wasnull during render you could add a quickif no user returned null or you couldinvestigate a bit more and find thatyour logout function makes two distinctState updates the first is setting theuser to null and then the second isredirecting the user to the homepage youswap the two and now no component willever have this bug again because theuser object is never null when you'rewithin the dashboard keep doing thefirst sort of bug fix and you end upwith a mess keep doing the second typeof bug fix and you'll have a cleansystem and a deep understanding of theinvariance makes perfect sense it's sotempting to just if no user return nullI will say as a huge react query fanI've been guilty of this where I solvethose error cases where they're comingup with errors but since especially withlike the new model I find myself justdefining within the call the right thingthe update to set things to null shouldalso send you to the right place Iabsolutely agree you should aim for thesecond type of fix don't underestimatethe value of digging into history toinvestigate some bugs again reading POrequests all that stuff really reallygood strategies I've always been prettygood at debugging weird issues with theusual toolkit of print line and thedebugger so I never really looked at getmuch to figure out the history of a bugbut for some bugs it's crucial Irecently had an issue with my serverwhere it was leaking memory seeminglyconstantly and then getting out ofmemory killed and restarted I couldn'tfigure out the cause of this for thelife of me every likely culprit wasruled out and I couldn't reproduce itlocally it felt like throwing dartsblindfolded I've certainly had bugs thatfelt like that and it is miserable Ilooked at the commit history and foundthat it started happening after I addedsupport for Play Store payments never aplace I would have looked in a millionyears it's just a couple of HTTPrequests turns out it was getting stuckin an infinite Loop of fetching accesstokens and after the first one expiredmaybe every request only added akilobyte or so to the memory whenthey're retrying every 10 millisecondsor so on multiple threads that starts toadd up quick and usually this is thesort of thing that would have resultedin a stack Overflow but I was usingasync recursion in Rust which doesn'tstackOverflow rust is a great programminglanguage this never would have occurredto me but when I'm forced to look into aspecific bit of code that I know musthave caused it suddenly the theory popsup I'm not sure what the rule is herefor when to do this and when not to it'sintuition based in a different sort ofhuh to a bug report that triggers thissort of Investigation you'll develop theintuition over time but it's enough toknow that sometimes it's invaluable ifyou'restuck along similar lines try out getbisect if the problem is amendable to itmeaning a g history of spa commits aquick automated way to test for theissue and you have one commit you knowis bad and one that's good I'm going togo a slightly weird angle with this formy ownadvice make itdeploy then make it useful I'd find thata lot of devs early on especially myselfwould spend so much time trying to makethe code work locally on their machinethat by the time they had it working itwas already complex enough to deployingit was nonviable with modern tools thatmake CI and CD easy like forsell netlifyany of these other options you can justlink your project to a GitHub repo andnow it will auto deploy Auto build andauto publish any changes you make whenyou push up the commits which makes itsignificantly easier in a situation likethis where you're trying to figure outwhich commit broke you're trying tofigure out why deploy aren't working orwhy out of memory is happening if youhave the ability to Auto deploy everyversion you can go look at an oldversion and see whether or not it wasworking as expected these types ofthings become exponentially easier andthe amount of time you'll spend dealingwith these things is exponentially lowerone more similar thing learn get reallyearly I know this what's gotten me intotrouble but the confidence you get fromrealizing making changes isn't scary ishuge when I started school it was veryclear to me that my peers were scaredwhen I would use their machines indelete code because to them code deletedwas code gone forever but if you learnthe basics of get you don't worryanywhere near as much yeah this is agreat reference I helped the dev a whileback who was trying to deploy theirgiant remix project onto versel I wasthe one screen sharing I was just youcan even tell from the uh terminal therethat's obviously me that's my colorcoding that's my um t-u everything thatwas my machine because I was so annoyedthat the particular Dev that was havingthe problem was insisting that vercellwas the issue even though they had neveronce got it to deploy so my response waswhat the can we get this remix canwe get a remix project to deploy andthen we can debug the difference betweenthe two because you should have madethis deploy as soon as you made it and Iwas able to get it working in like 10minutes once I jumped in even with likeLee Rob and crew hopping in too it was aa fun chaotic experience that absolutelycould have been settled if the dev haddeployed before they built so asunintuitive as it might sound to putdeploy first before you make somethinguseful trust me it makes life better andthat's why all of my tutorials I deployreally really early and then we do therestafter back to the article this is agreat article by the way uh shout out MBuffett will give you a big Shout Outnear the end I'm sure I'll put theirTwitter in the description too give thema follow it's really easy to writeterrible code but it's also really easyto write code that follows absolutelyevery best practice which has been unitintegration fuzz and mutation tested forgood measure your startup will just runout of money before you finish don'tforget those Airbnb lint rules thatAirbnb doesn't even use so a lot ofprogramming is figuring out the balanceabsolutely agree I'm going to drop thehot take of simple almost always scalesone more of Mind aim for simple itscales well I'll even put surprisinglywell I find people will look at a simplething and say oh what happens whenthat's at Enterprise scale well if thearchitecture is simple enough then whatthe way it scales up as it gets moredifficult is way less bad than somethingthat starts difficult and has morecomplexity as you go and it's a balanceit's absolutely balance but if you aimfor simple the likelihood that thingsscale well is actually higher not lowerand people love to pretend otherwise andthey're wrong if you erir on the side ofwriting code quickly you'll occasionallyget bitten by a bad bit of tech debt youlearn stuff like I should add greattesting for data processing because itoften is impossible to correct later orI should really think through tabledesign because changing things withoutdowntime can be extremely hard if you ERon the side of writing perfect code youdon't get any feedback sorry rustthings just universally take a long timeyou don't know where you're spendingyour time on things that really deserveit and matter or if you're just wastingthat time feedback mechanisms areessential for Learning and you're notgetting that I absolutely agree I wasjust filming a video earlier aboutLadybird which is a new browser that'sentirely unusable because its goal isimplementing web standards not being agood usable browser as a result thelikelihood that they get actual feedbackabout what is and isn't working is waylower versus the browser I'm using Arcwhich I've used for a while now stillhas a fun bug where when I click thecollections tab because I download a lotof things it lags my browser is chuggingnow because I have some thousand filesin that folder which means I can givethem that feedback and they'rerethinking decisions around their entireSwift architecture because Swift is sobad at long lists but they're able tolearn these things and make thesechanges because they have actual usersbecause they ship something soonerversus ladybird which isn't going to useany existing solution they're buildingeverything themselves and as a resultthe amount of time it takes for them toget any feedback at all ismassive to be clear I don't mean bad asin I couldn't remember the Syntax forcreating a hash map so I did two interLoops instead I mean bad like thefollowing instead of a rewrite of ourdata ingestion to make the specificState unrepresentable I added a coupleasserts over our invariance at a couplekey checkpoints ohoh yeah our server models are exactlythe same as the dto we would write so Ijust serialized those instead of writingall the boiler plates so we can writethe dto later asneeded I skipped writing tests for thesecomponents because they're trivial and abug in one of them is no big deal I meanthat's all components ideally but yeahgoodexamples make debugging easier I likethat one a lot let's see what he has tosay here there's so many little tricksI've acquired over the years on makingsoftware easier to debug if you don'tmake any effort to make debugging easyyou're going to spend unacceptableamounts of time debugging each isue asyour software gets more and more complexhey uh nextjs make things easier todebug please thanks I know you'reworking on it I know's working on it Ijust had to point that out because ifyou don't have browser tools things area lot harder it's a great Point tooyou'll be terrified to make changesbecause even a couple new bugs mighttake you a week to figure out yepthere's plenty of code bases I'm scaredto touch because I'm more likely to adda bug than fix the thing I'm trying tofix in the first place here's someexamples of what I mean by the way thisperson's a huge chest brow and has a coucool chess Services they built for theback end of chessbook they have acommand to copy all of a user's datadown to local so they can reproduceissues easily with only a username basedthey trace every local request with openTelemetry making it very easy to see howa request spends its time also basedeven though open Telemetry is astandard I have a scratch file that actsas a pseudo repple which re-executes onevery change ooh I love this I'm a bigfan of having a Sandbox file in yourproject so that you can just try thingsthere and not have to like spin a bunchof stuff up to do it this makes it easyto pull out bits of code and play aroundwith it to get a better idea of what'sgoing on love it totally agree oh here'sa fun one in staging they limitparallelism to one so that it's easierto visually parse logs ooh spicy I likeit for the front end I have a debugrequests setting which preventsoptimistic loading of data to make iteasier to debug requests interesting Ithink I dig that I also have a debugState setting that will print out theentire state of the program after eachupdate along with a pretty diff of whathappened they also have a file full oflittle functions that get the UI intospecific States so that is they'retrying to fix bugs they don't have tokeep clicking in the UI to get to thatstate I should have more of that it's aweird example but I have this projectDoge T3 G so I actually put this littlequery Pam on the page where Dev mode istrue now we get this thing on the pagewhere I can really quickly add a bunchof values add money and then get thisinto the state I'm trying to debug atany given time this was essential togetting this working I can't imagine howI would have built this project withoutit there's definitely not a reallypopular project in the front-end worldthat is significantly more annoying thanit ever should be that people usebecause getting their components intothe right state is really hard that'sthat's definitely not a thing it's notlike people would use this componentLibrary tool to debug UI because theydon't have a way to get the UI into thestate that they're actually testing thatwould be absurd there's definitely not awhole industry of people making reallyannoying tools that keep getting misusedbecause UI devs kind of suck that'sdefinitely not a thing unrelated websiteby the way ignore whatever I was justscrolling totally don't know how I endedup there yeah having ways to get yourcomponents into the state that theyshould be yeah you should and every Devshould normalize that the idea of makingit easy to see play with debug Etc ithelps with places you wouldn't evenexpect like having these tools makeslike QA easier too it's just it's goodit's really good practice to find simpleways to get your application into thestates that you're actually working onit also will encourage you by the way tomake things simpler because if it's toohard to get things in the right Stateyou'll start to realize ways to simplifythat State Management and those arealmost always worthwhile stay vigilantabout how much of your debugging time isspent on setup reproduction and cleanupafterwards if it's over 50% you shouldfigure out how to make it easier even ifthat will take slightly longer this timebugs should get easier to fix over timeall else being equal I hate that's aspicy take because it's entirely correctas a code base gets more complex youshould be counter trting that makingreproduction even easier to dealwith when working on a team you shouldusually ask the question I'm puttingthat in mind too uh dumb questions ruleI've talked about this a bunch I can'teven remember which videos I havebecause there been so many the dumbquestions rule is a thing I apply to newEngineers when they join my team Imandate a minimum number of dumbquestions that they have to ask everyday if they haven't asked me at leastone dumb question every day for theirfirst week or two the day is not overuntil they ask the question the reason Ipush this is because devs and honestlyeveryone is really insecure aboutfeeling dumb in saying dumb things so Iforce them to get over that by makingthem do it ask the dumb question and itkind of goes back to this point earlierof taking feedback from unfamiliar devsmore seriously because the dumb questionis a thing others probably thought whenthey were trying the project for thefirst time but they were too scared tosay and if you don't get that feedbackyou'll never know and this goes bothways if you're the Dev that always asksthe question you're more likely to beworking in code bases that solve theseproblems because if everyone on the teamisn't willing to say it and you're alsonot willing to say it it won't get fixedbut even if everyone else isn't willingbut you are all of a sudden these thingsstart to get fixed so it's reallyimportant to ask the questions even ifno one else on your team is in the worstcases you get fired for and you can finda team that's better aligned with youthere's a spectrum of trying to figureout everything for yourself versusbugging your co-workers with everylittle question and I I think mostpeople start their careers way too faron the former side absolutely agree ithas been hard for me to find people whoask too many questions when they'reworking with me there are absolutelypeople who are not working for me thatare just random people in my DMs askingme all sorts of stupid totally seethat that is a problem but for the vastmajority of people especially oncethey're employed they're almost scaredto ask the question and you got to pushthem to or if you're that person youjust got to do it don't be scared to askthe question almost ever there's alwayssomeone around that has been in the codebase for longer or knows technology Xway better than you or knows the productbetter or is just a more experiencedengineer in general there's so manytimes in that first 6 months of workingsomewhere where you could spend over anhour figuring something out or you couldget the answer in a few minutes againreally important point I can't tell youhow many times the dumb question endedup being well I've been stuck on thisfor 4 hours do you have any tips on howto get this particular tool working andmy response was oh yeah you should runthese two commands instead I should haveupdated the docs for that my bad I'mgoing to go fix that and now this thingthat had spent hours on get solved inlike 30 seconds and our docs improvehuge massive this is a great thing thankyou schaer for sharing this junior Devhere I've been praised as the best on myteam at asking questions ask thequestion you don't have to be anexperienced engineer to ask goodquestions in fact the inexperiencedEngineers they have a massive Advantagebecause they have better questionsbecause they're not going to default toexisting knowledge that might beincorrect they're going to challenge thething and they're going to ask greatquestions as a result lean into that asa junior Dev and as an experienced oneget those questions get that feedbackit's all so helpful this happens all thetime I I can't I would love if you havethis to link it because this happensfive times a day there is no world inwhich I remember your specific questionlike you it we all have these momentsthat haunt you know what one more pieceofadvice that one dumb thing that hauntsyounobody remembersit I have plenty of those I have so manyof these moments where like wow I can'tbelieve I thought that or did that likelike here's a fun one that actually gotbrought up because others remembered itfor me so bad example but I love it Ididn't know react query could be usedfor things that weren't graphql untilTanner Lindley was on Jason langdorfstream there's actually in the VOD I betI could find it yeah cool almostcertainly going to be at this time stampyeah yes look at me in chatthere look atthat I am so so so stupid and somehowjust realize react query isn't just agraphql client I need to go do a verydeep dive and this was October 21st 2020we've all had these issues we've all hadthat moment where we feel dumb andnobody remembers the only reason thatone got noticed is somebody else waswatching the video and said yo Theo Isaw you pop up in stream here look atyour comments I was like wow holyI'm dumb but no one else remembered noone remembers those moments don't worryabout it and again the only time thatthis would ever annoy people if you'reasking too many questions is if it'sclear you could have found the answeryourself in a few minutes and even thenit can be useful because you might nothave known the strategy to find theanswer and if I then show you thatawesome you'll ask less questions I'vehad once or twice in my career wheresomebody would ask questions over andover and I'm like okay how did you tryto figure this out and then realize theydidn't know about one of the docsresources or one of the things to searchsort for and when I show them that theywould stop like almost every time ifyou're asking too many questions it'sbecause you haven't been shown the wayto find the answers and if you ask toomany questions awesome now we canrealize that deficiency exists and wecan plug it after you responded to me Isat down and got really intounderstanding how these things actuallywork so it helped you a ton that'sawesome I'm sorry if I was harsh in thereply there but I it sounds like youused that opportunity to level up and bebetter like even if I didn't handle yourquestion well it seems like you handledit awesome and I really hope that you'renot scared of asking questions in thefuture because that's dope to have youhere have you sharing this experienceand have you productive enough to todeeply understand next now you massivelyleveled up as a result of that so I lovethat shipping Cadence matters a lotthink hard about what will get youshipping quickly and often love thisstartups have limited Runway projectshave deadlines when you quit your job tostrike out on your own your savings willonly last you so many months that thishits too deep this hurts Hur me in mysoul ideally your speed on a projectonly compounds over time until h no I Ihave another Theo point and it's noteven that related to this but it'sinspiring me uh you don't know whatlevel you're at until you get an offerat that level somewhere else companieslove to make you think you're not acertain level because they don't want topay you for that promotion so theyalways make the promotion process hellthere was a window where I didn't thinkI was a senior Dev because I was havingproblems getting my senior doc to likeget started I just getting my managersto do it was annoying turns out thosemanagers sucked and when I startedapplying to other companies Not only wasI massively exceeding their bar forsenior I was approaching like the stafflevel bar and I didn't realize thatbecause I didn't realize I should betalking to other companies and notbasing my ability on what this oneparticular person thinks they should orshouldn't sign off on because thereality was if that manager promoted methey'd have one less headcount for asenior Dev but if they didn't promote methey could hire another senior Dev andhave me underpaid outworking that seniorDev it was an obvious win for my team soI never understood what my actual levelwas because my company had a competitiveadvantage of not telling me and thenwhen I figured it out gave him thefinger and quit they were worse off as aresult regardless this happens all thetime and you as an individual developershould know how much you're actuallyworth what your skills actually looklike measured up against other actualcompanies so do interviews a ton all forthat a point interview a lot at leastonce every 6 months one more on thistopic giveinterviews if you're qualified for therole you're qualified to interview fortherole yeah I find so many devs take waytoo long to get into the interviewprocess on both sides they take too longto start getting interviews to work at acompany and once they're at the companythey're hesitant to start givinginterviews interviews are essential toour success and growth and opportunitiesas devs you got to push through it itsucks but you have to give interviews dointerviews deeply understand interviewsif you can't do those well you'remassively bottlenecking yourself andyour capabilities certainlybottlenecking your success yeah this hitdeep the reason I thought of all of thatis I just started thinking too muchabout quitting and going off on my ownand realizing at that moment oh Ishould have quit a while earlier I amvery down if you're down to share but nopressure at all hoi I still want tounderstand why the session never getspast the client this is strange asto me the data is there but it simplynever receives the prop I'm looking allover for the solution this one was notactuallyparticularly obvious yeah I'm going todrop an even hotter take for you hooithis wasn't a problem with yourunderstanding so much as next beingshitty get serers side props being afunction both for redirecting and forpassing props is bad this code showsjust how bad the conflation of concernsthat existed in Old Pages router was thefact that you could do this that youcould return a redirect and props is afundamental design failure in next so Ido not blame you at all for this this iswhy old nextjs sucked and this is alsowhy I think new nextjs is so good itdoes a great job at solving theseproblems by not having these magic funthat have all of these different rolesyou just component style call whatyou're doing when you do it so Iactually am pumped that you found thisexample because it's subtle but itactually perfectly showcases the typesof design failures that the old nextmodel by Design encouraged a lot of sophenomenal oh I missed your follow-upquestion too my bad on that you passsession as props it does not show in theprops initialproblem uh I think you understand now sowhenever you send the data grabs appgrabbing session provider so wheneveryou send the data of the session asprops s is grabbing it passing it yepyep to be clear these things were waymore complex than they should have beenand none of this is your fault like Ireally want to emphasize that point thisdesign sucked because of next and Iactually love that you brought this upas an example because yeah this was yourhuge learning is you had only worked insingle Page Apps and this abstractionfor them wasn't great like you know thatwas a good question cuz it was like youdidn't pretend you understood more thanyou did you said that it doesn't makesense it's small I'm going to give you amassive compliment here there's a lot ofsubtle things in this question that Ithink you did really well I want tounderstand you didn't say this is wrongor dumb you didn't say this problemsucks or that this tool sucks you saidthat you want to understand why thisstrange thing is happening and you evensaid strange to you the qualifiers hereare actually incredible this is likealmost like an artistic example of likea really really good question when youfeel lost and clueless you owned that itwas your desire to understand this wasthe fact that you said the wordunderstand before describing the problemthat you want to understand huge hugegreen flag you're not just trying to fixthe problem and move on you want tounderstand it and it's strange to youyou know it might not be strange toothers you know that there might besomething better that's just notclicking for you this is a great greatquestion so yeah I wouldn't even qualifythis as a dumb question honestly if ifyou had presented this to me as anemployee of mine as your dumb question Iwould have said no that's a goodquestion come back with the Dumber onelater this is great A+ fantasticrepresentation and like to anyonelooking for examples of how to ask aquestion about something you don'tunderstand here you go just say it saythat you want understand and you don'tand say what is confusing to youfantastic A++ thank you for sharing thatwho you wrot by the way like that'sreally good gold example of asking aquestion when you're clueless people arereally scared to do if you just don'tunderstand at all it's scary to ask thequestion but you did it you learned abunch and now I get to highlight you ina video as an example of these types ofthings A+ is all around I love thisthank you for sharing don't worry abouthaving to participate in the time andall that but if you're down and you'rehere clearly you bring a lot of value sopump to have you here man anyways let'ssee more what this author has to sayideally your speed on a project onlycompounds over time until your shippingfeatures faster than you could have everimagined to ship fast you need to do alot of things oh I'm so pumped that youhave you're the best person to teachlike knowing that you ask questions thatwell means you're going to set a reallygood example for the students the factthat there's people that are learningfrom you makes me very very excited backto these examples of things that youshould do if you want to ship fast you asystem that isn't prone to bugs you needa quick turnaround time between teamsyou need a willingness to cut out the10% of a new feature that's going totake half the time Yep this happs a lotthe the number of times I see a producta feature a tech plan a spec that wouldbe way way simpler if we trim one or twothings half my videos where I'm rantingabout old jobs are just me complainingabout this specifically so couldn'tagree more consistent reusable patternsthat you can compose together for Newscreens features and end points Yep thisis a huge part of why react one by theway the fact that the patterns andcomponents can all be reused composedstacked and done all these crazy waysthat's why react really took off earlybecause it scaled well to small projectsand big projects and it lets you movereally fast quick and easy deploys wow Imust have pre-read when I said make itdeploy then make it useful crazy processthat doesn't slow you down like flakytests slow CI fuzzy linters slow PRreviews jira as a religion Etc yep andabout a million other things of courseshipping slowly should Merit apostmortem as much as breakingproduction does holy spicy take that Ilove our industry doesn't run like thatbut it doesn't mean you can't personallyfollow the north star of shipping fastcouldn't agree more at every scale Ijust dropped the link in the reply tothis tweet because that was such a greatarticle I know I say that a lot but uhholy I'm very thankful for thisauthor when I found this articleinitially I quickly checked theirTwitter they were following me I waslike oh my God awesome I reached outthey were really hyped and God I'mexcited for them to see this videobecause that was great I say this a lotbut that article was great I haven'tagreed that hard on something I've readon stream for a while let me know whatyou think in the comments though andwhat you learned that might benefit youas an experience Dev or as a new oneuntil next time peace Nars",
    "summary": "The YouTube video summarizes a blog post by MBuffett, reflecting on 15 years of coding experience and offering advice to his younger self. The video host, Theo, reads and reacts to the post, providing his own insights and experiences along the way. The core advice revolves around efficiency, pragmatic decision-making, and understanding the context of the software being developed.\n\nKey themes include fixing root causes instead of patching symptoms (e.g., addressing race conditions instead of adding UI thread dispatches), prioritizing performance fixes (e.g., optimizing database calls), and the importance of code review (PR) tabs for understanding a codebase rather than simply reading code. The video emphasizes listening to new developers' initial impressions, as they often identify problems that veterans have become accustomed to. There's also a strong focus on balancing code quality with shipping speed, tailoring development practices to the specific project's risk profile, and the absurdity of blindly adhering to metrics like code coverage.\n\nFurthermore, the video highlights the value of investing in tooling and debugging skills, the importance of asking \"dumb questions\" to uncover hidden assumptions and improve documentation, and the benefit of deploying code early and often for faster feedback loops. The discussion concludes with the idea that individual developers should understand their worth by interviewing regularly, that startups should focus on simplicity, and the importance of shipping fast in order to get feedback. The host reinforces the ideas with personal anecdotes and real-world examples, making the advice relatable and actionable for developers of all levels."

    "transcript": "the insanity of being a softwareengineer. They must do dates differentthan us because that would be June. Iwas like, \"Wait a second. Are we intothe f We must be reading something inthe past. Wait a second. It's writteninto the future.\" No, it's because theydid dates are different. Okay, dates aredifferent. There's something I thinkabout often because I can't help butwonder if most other jobs are like this.Being a software engineer is tough. Youneed to know a couple of programminglanguages and tools right from theget-go, but that won't cut it. Companiesexpect you to know or to know whateverparticular framework they use. Thatmight be Rails, Django or Laravel orsomething else. You also need CSS. It'lltake you a lifetime to learn and stillyou won't know why the layout'sbreaking. But knowing just enough to getby is feasible. All right, I'm actuallyalready ready to do a little bit of atake on this one. I can tell you thismuch. Comparing software engineering toother jobs is always kind of a bad idea.And the reason being is that let's takeelectrical engineering for instance.You're given a spool of say some sort ofEthernet. You're given the points inwhich you want it to be uh linked infrom and taken all the way to. Then it'sup to you to be able to go into thedrywall, set up the connection, set upwhatever you got to do, set up thelittle box, put it to the stud, makesure it's there, and then set up all thewires. Make sure everything's there.Make sure you have all the right wiringand everything. In software engineeringland, they can't give you wire. You haveto learn how to mentally form what wireis, right? It's like your wrinkly brainis what determines if you can understandwhat wire is. Then there is no definiteaccess point. There's just crap inhundreds, if not thousands of filesspread all around. And you have tounderstand how these little bits of dataare being manipulated between variousfiles and CSS. Yeah, it's gotten a lotbetter. As somebody who's currentlywriting their own layout in Lua, I missthe DOM, man. You guys have it so easy.You know, the amount of people thatcomplain about CSS and the DOM, you guysare losers. Did you know that? Becausethis DOM and CSS makes laying out sodang easy. Sprinkle a little bit oftailwind, put 5,000 classes throughoutyour code, and you guys manage toevery day on the internet about how hardit is. Shut up, dude. The DOM is amagical piece of software. Oh, youforgot to close the tag. Don't worry, Igot it for you, buddy. Like, what whatare you complaining about? Just lettingyou know how I feel. Anyways, it'sunlikely that you won't have to dealwith JavaScript. Actually, I do want togo back to this. Do you know what I usedto have to do to do basic softwareengineering on the web? There was thisthing called Clear Fix. And if you'venever seen ClearFix, well, you shouldsee ClearFix because this is somethingthat I actively used. I'm sure if Isigned into my account, you'd probablysee a thumbs up on this button. So, it'sfor a bygone era, right? So, ClearFix,you would do this. You do this wholelike content after you do kind of thislittle blank empty space visibilityhidden display box height zero clearboth. And what this would allow you todo is to clear odd floating issues. Andthe reason being is that in the oldiedays when you used to have to havesomething if you wanted say three panelslike this in the center of your screenwith crap on it, you had to usesomething called float left. and floatleft. Well, it would kind of suckbecause if you wanted to put somethingright here, well, the only way you couldput something right here is if you dothis like magical little container clearfixing because if you didn't clear fixit, this guy would just appear rightlike right here. And then some browsers,it just acted different and it was justa huge pain in the ass and there's allsorts of things clear mentioned. And sowhen I often think about life today andthe and the niceness, you know, I justthink, man, what a great platform it isto develop a UI. Honestly, it's easy.I'm always just surprised at how muchframework honestly is being used in anenvironment that that is that easy toget stuff done. It's so much simplernow. Yeah, it just feels surprising.Bing or it's unlikely that you won'thave to deal with JavaScript. Maybeyou're lucky and you just need tosprinkle it in uh in the occasionaljQuery in the legacy app you'remaintaining, but things change. Well, Imean, there's plenty of professions thatjust don't use JavaScript. You know, Idon't want you to have to think thatJavaScript is inevitable, though. It is.Like, if you ever want to, you'll findoften that side projects will intersecta little bit of JavaScript every now andthen, which is a bit sad. Like, that'sjust the state of this just this justlife. Welcome to life. At some point,the people at Facebook built React.Turns out that company with tens ofthousands of engineers who had twospecialties all along, front end andbackend. The programming hivemindcollectively decided that React is nowthe right way to build software. But atthe same time, companies decided theycan't afford more engineers. Lo andbehold, the full stack engineer is bornand you get it or and you are it. Get tolearning React and building REST APIs ontop of the backend tech you are youalready know. Yeah, I'm always curiousabout this whole full stack business. Ikind of feel like full stack isn'treally born out of companies decidingthey can't afford more engineers. Ithink generally speaking, it's just muchmore convenient. Do you know what Imean? I get that full stack it meanssomething different at at differentcompanies. So, I'm not saying that oneis somehow what's it called? I'm notsaying that they're all equal, all that.But if you've ever worked at a companywhere you can't touch the back end andyou can only do the front end, it'sreally really annoying. So people whocomplain about full stack, it kind offeels like you complain about fullstack, but you don't realize thealternative. The alternative is justawful. You open a ticket. Yes. Open aticket. Haha. Yeah. And then you wait.Then you just hope. Well, geez, I hopethe gods of the back end bless me. Theybless me with with the possibility ofhaving my feature in. Oh, it turns outthe ticket I wrote wasn't complete.Turns out the way I wrote it, it didn'tquite work out. Guess we have to go backto the drawing board. Now you're talkingto your PM. You're talking to your boss.You're saying the reason why none ofthis stuff is working. It's because youopened a ticket, the ticket was writtenpoorly, and now you're on to like threeweeks of doing nothing and you'refeeling it. Honestly, full stackish isbetter. I have seen a lot of full stackroles pay the same as front-endengineering roles. Yeah. Felt it. Yeah,you felt it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.Yeah. I I prefer the uh I don't likehaving to sit behind and wait forsomebody else. I do think it's reallynice when you get the freedom and theresponsibility to be able to just do ityourself. This is why I always thinkthat startups are really nice to work atbecause a lot of people you don'trealize how much you learn at a startup,right? A startup is going to give yousuch exposure and you just simply haveto like put on a bunch of differenthats. And when I say a startup, I meanlike early stage startup. I don't meanlike a company like I don't mean Amazon.Oh, we're a startup now. We're theworld's largest startup. everybodycoming to work 60 hours a week and we'renot going to give youstock except after two two after twoyears but we're going to try to fire youor make you quit before then but don'tworry we're startup baby uh and also todefend React becoming like collectivelya reason why React was actually largelyhated when it launched but the moment Iused it I was like oh man this is somuch more convenient coming from thejQuery side of the world the ability tojust write what looks like DOMinside JavaScript and then have it poopout on the screen was like it was superduper to me. I'm just saying I think JSXwas great. I think that if you worked inany other environment you wouldunderstand why there's a lot of greatthings about having the ability to writeDOM into the UI. I think that is justtrue but it also kind of suckssometimes. Anyways, uh it won't stopthere. You need to know types or let'ssee you need let's see you know you needtypes right? Add TypeScript. Okay, sothis is definitely a very webperspective document, but yes, it's veryvery true. Uh, and are these types? Ihate to break. Hey hate, new news alertnews flash. There was always types. It'sjust linting. It's not types. It's neverbeen types. It's just lint. There is notype system where you can just go, Idon't know. I don't need to say itanymore. Are you really going to bemanaging state and react like a pleb? Abredux. Oh my gosh. This article waswritten just like my painful walkthrough the park. Uh, feeling smartbecause you dodged both of those. Havefun figuring out how to configureWebpack ESB build rollup plus prettierplus ESLint. What's that one gif wherethe guy just goes, \"No.\" Yeah, that'swhy I go with no build. Uh, okay. Yousay, \"But I can keep doing things theway that I've been doing them. It workedfine. I don't need React.\" Of course youcan. You can absolutely deviate from theway things are done everywhere in yourfast-moving, money burning startup. Justtell your boss that you're available toteach the new hires who uh only everheard of React, the joys of serversiderendering. I just want you to know thisarticle was written in pain and duress.This poor man is going through a ve verypainful moment and decided to write itout on paper. Oh, and turns out we'rejust getting started. Back whendinosaurs roamed the earth, there was atype of profession called systemadminister. Their whole job was to makesure your backend was working nicely.They handled infrastructure changes,upgrading the database, system upgrades,keeping the Damon running, restarts,everything. Then came DevOps. Somecashstrapped company somewhere decidedthat now all of this would be handled bythe engineers and everyone agreed. Youneed to learn Docker. Oh, your whole appis just a single statically linkedbinary and you don't need Docker. learnanible and I hope you have fun figuringout the options you need to pass asystemd okay thattruing I mean also I mean to be fairalso we do live in a world where ifyou're at a startup and you have nousers you can also use one of these manyserverless just available things you canuse SST and you don't even have to use aserverless company you could just launchstraight up on Amazon or on other cloudproviders and you could just run withthat right And you don't have to havelike everything and you don't have toworry that much. Like it we do we dowork in a really weird world in thesense that everything that is hard andeverything that companies have tostruggle with, you can also just paymore and have it done for you before youever have to get to that point ofworrying about it. Right? A lot of timesI think we we confuse yacht problemswith everyday problems. Like when you'rea startup and you have $500,000 infunding, you probably don't need to hiresomebody that's just like that's it. I'mgonna learn how to have all of ourservices launched. You know, it's justlike maybe that's just maybe that's justnot the right way to burn your money.Maybe you guys just don't care about it.DAX kills it. OpenJS2 banger. Yeah, Daxkilled it. Yeah, Dax did a great job onthat stuff. And you're not even halfwaythere. You got to learn AWS. You won'tbe using the GUI to configure yourinfrastructure like a peasant. So, youbetter learn Terraform and Palumi orwhatever. You do a good job. You'repromoted to manager. Oh, that's by theway, that's the also an odd part aboutour software engineering. You know what?I don't think enough people talk aboutthis or maybe they do. Maybe I justdon't know. But why do we take the bestengineers and just make them managers?What's that about? How How is that anormal path? You're good at your job.You have to stop. Hey guy who just showsout turns out to be very good atprogramming and setting up stuff andworking with people and making thingswork. We're gonna make you quitprogramming. Go to management. It's justweird. It's just a weird path that we doto people. But maybe, okay, to be on theother side of it, maybe there'ssomething to it. Hear me out. The peoplewho desperately seek to be manager, I'msomewhat convinced they're eithersociopaths or masochists. Like that'sit. I can't I don't know what else to gowith, right? They only really have twosides because it just doesn't make anysense. And do you really want them to beyour manager? I don't know. I don'tknow. But that's okay because it it'sthe endgame bliss. Here's some stuffyou'll need to do. Guestimate deadlines.Assign tasks to teammates. Spect tasks.Participate in annual reviews. Providevaluable feedback during productmeetings. You better hope your companyhas quadrupled in number of employees atby this point or you'll be doingmanagement plus all of the above. And itcan always get worse. A recruiterreached out to me a couple days agoabout engineering position for a secretcompany. They decided that they requiredsenior level skills in Rails, Hotwire,and incredibly native mobiledevelopment. Why not add kernel andcompiler development in there as wellfor good measure? It is pretty hard tobe a senior software engineer to be liketruly senior in Rails and Hotwire and innative mobile app development. Thatwould be pretty impressive to to F ishotwire. Hotwire is uh it's HTMX forRails. But what's the Laravel version?Livewire. Yeah, that's right. Hot wire,LiveWire. HTMX is uh there's HMX,Livewire, and Hotwire. They're all kindofish the same. Um all right. Softwaregets more complicated. All of thiscomplexity is there for a reason. Butwhat happened to specializing? When ahouse is being built, tons of people areinvolved. Architects, civil engineers,plumbers, electricians, brick layers,interior designers, roofers, surveyors,pavers, you name it. You don't need asingle person or even a single companyto be able to do all of those. Yeah,this again, bad analogy. Bad analogy.Um, I think this makes sense. I thinkthat would make sense if you worked atlike a marketing firm that builds upcomplicated single-purpose apps forvarious like for various platformsbecause then you could have this guythat goes on and he sets up the mobileapp so that you could be successful,gets everything in place, everythinglooks really nice. The foundationengineer, the agency, right? And thengoes to the next project and does itagain. Goes to the next project and doesdoes it again. Learns all the details.Gets everything set up. Make sure youguys like I mean can you really have afoundation layer? I'm not sure if that'seven possible in programming, right?Because then I would have to ask well ifthis guy is going from project toproject manually setting all this up.Can we not automate what's happeninghere? Why is this happening? Why are wedoing this? This seems like a commandthat should be ran. Porquia, right? Andso then the thing with housing marketsand all that is that someone who's anelectrician comes in when framing's upand electrician is orthogonal toframing. There is no feature you developas a software engineer that isorthogonal to the codebase. Right? Bythe way, engineers love usingorthogonal. But it's not like someonecan set together, start using React,start putting in Redux or whateverlibrary they want. They start throwingin all sorts of crap. They build up thiswhole architecture. They have theirwhole design in mind for exactly howeverything should go. You can't justcome in and be like, \"Oh, I'm theelectrician. I just simply need to dosomething completely separate from therest of what you've done.\" Right? Likeit just it doesn't exist like that.There is no world where the things aredifferent, right? You cannot have aelectrician come in do electricianthings. You cannot come in and have aplumber do plumbering things. That isjust not a possibility in the softwareengineering world. Even front end andback end aren't that way becausewhatever decisions are made on the backend affect the front end and whateverdecisions are made on the front endattempt to affect the back end. Likethere it's just one behemoth and that'swhy we invented microservices to avoidthe behemoth and then the behemoth isstill a a behemoth. Maybe a future wherewe can build a whole app with a coupleof prompts isn't so bad. That takeawaythough. That takeaway. I love theopiumat the end, but that takeaway is hurtingme. I'm not gonna lie to you guys. Assomebody who recently did a lot of vibecoding, specifically prompt coding, uh Ican tell you one thing about a codebasethat has had the prompt treatment. Itlooks like sarcasm. It could be. Here'sthe thing is that people often equatethese AIs to like junior developerswhile also saying simultaneously thatthey're like mega PhD candidates. Okay,I just want you to just think for asecond. They put all this stuff togetherand then they say this is what'shappening. This is what I see. A juniorengineer will at least come up with anattempt at an architecture. Now theattempt may not be good but it is anattempt prompt. There is no architecturethere. There is no spoon. Okay? It willdo what needs to be done at the placethat it should be done at regardless ofanything else that has been done before.And it hurts. It hurts emotionally. Now,somebody who's recovering, someone who'sa previous prompt recoverer, I'm justletting you know it hurts. It hurts realreal bad. Now, on the other hand, I'mgoing to say it again. Cursor tab,though. Damn, it's so good. It's sogood. Thename is the primogen.",
    "summary": "The video \"The Insanity of Being a Software Engineer\" explores the challenging and ever-evolving nature of the software engineering profession, using an article as a jumping-off point. Prime Reacts emphasizes how software engineers must possess knowledge of multiple languages, frameworks, and tools, constantly adapting to new technologies like React and TypeScript. He contrasts this with fields like electrical engineering, where tasks are more defined and components (like wires) are provided, while software engineers must conceptually create these elements and navigate complex, interconnected codebases with no definite access points. He humorously critiques the common complaints about CSS and the DOM, arguing that modern UI development is significantly easier than in the past (e.g. ClearFix), and expresses surprise at the widespread use of frameworks in an already simplified environment.\n\nThe discussion further delves into the emergence of the \"full stack\" engineer. Prime Reacts suggests that it arose not solely from cost-cutting, but also from the inherent inconveniences of working in siloed front-end or back-end roles. He suggests a \"full stack-ish\" approach, that is overall better for flexibility. He appreciates being able to work as a fullstack, learning from start ups as they require the engineers to wear many hats. However, he notes the inherent problems of taking skilled engineers and promoting them to management.\n\nFinally, the video touches on the increasing complexity of infrastructure management, the need to learn DevOps tools like Docker and Terraform, and the potential (and perils) of AI-assisted coding. Prime Reacts cautions against viewing AI coding assistants as junior developers, noting that they lack architectural understanding and can create chaotic codebases with no sense of organization or cohesion. While acknowledging the potential of tools like Cursor Tab, he emphasizes the pain and challenges of dealing with code generated by AI prompts. He warns the audience against equating the AI coders to junior developer-level intelligence."

of the basicconcepts and the motivations and thenthey'll go into more detail in some ofthe other talks about some of theimportant principles as you've seen onthe agenda I always like to start thediscussion with this statement it's likea mantra almost that I do because a lotof people come to design withdeep-seated perfectionist tendencies andthose tendencies undermine all ourattempts to do good design this I say assomeone who has this tendency andspeaking to a room full of I'm sure 90%of you have this tendency to so keepthat in the back of your mind as we goalong now there are a lot of

good case for itand I will try to illustrate that casewith an example all this stuff is soabstract I like to get straight to anexample so mostly in this talk I'll gothrough thethe example is from a domain ofcontainer shipping this is for bulkcargo transport and most people I thinkare at least a little bit familiar withthis almost all bulk cargo these days isloaded into containers like this one andthen put onto ships like this to goacross the ocean transfer it in portslike this to go on to other ships or onthe trains you just simply attach achassis to the bottom of the containerand it becomes a train car or adifferent kind of chancing it becomes athe trailer of the truck and so thiskind of intermodal transportation it'svery efficient and you can imagine ithas some logistical complexity andbecause of that logistical complexitythere's a lot of software involved wellanyway so imagine that we work in acompany a shipping company and our jobis to write software that addressesthose logistical issues so a typicalkind of problem a kind of case that wemight be looking at would involve say acustomer calling one of our clerks andsaying I have a container in Hong Kong Iwant to ship it to Dallas Texas so theclerk might say alright they put intothe computer the origin is Hong Kongthe destination is Dallas and thecomputer will come up with routing forthat cargo and then they will explain itback to the customer alright your cargowould be loaded in Hong Kong on to aspecific vessel voyage ABC is thedesignator that in this picture and thenin Hong Kong you'll be transferred ontoa train XYZ and that will get it to toTexasto Dallas Texas on a certain date andtime my customer says all right thatsounds good book it so then they take afew more steps and it's stored in thecomputer this is our first use case andwe could start immediately thinkingabout alright what kind of what kind ofobjects do we need or what kind offunctions do we need and we coulddevelop a design and a model for thisthing but that ignores one of therealities of software development andthat is that we already have softwarethat does this in almost every projectwe are working with in a problem spacewhere there's already a lot of softwareour software will have to coexist withthat software perhaps it will be perhapswe're talking about a refinement of theexisting software perhaps we're talkingabout some new piece of software they'llintegrate with another piece of softwareor baby we're talking about a new pieceof software that's replacing a piece ofexisting software but there's alwaysexisting software even in so-calledgreenfield projects there's stillexisting software and that's a veryimportant constraint so I don't like toignore that constraint and a number ofthe of the techniques that will betalked about later some of those arerelated to that especially contextmapping but right now we'll sort ofassume that we are going to be refiningan existing piece of software so let'slook briefly at the design of theexisting software so this is a veryhigh-level view and in this veryhigh-level view we can see that we havean object called a cargo which ispopulated with all the information thatthe clerk would collect as they talk tothe customer especially the origin anddestination of that cargo then they passthat information to a service called therouting serviceand that service will figure out thesteps right which actual vessel voyageswhich ships at which times can actuallytake the cargo from its origin to itsdestination and as it does that it putsits answers into a database table calledcargo bookings now this design which isfairly typicalI think of legacy software of a certaingeneration and it's not a bad design ithas one characteristic that's quite goodwhich is I can explain it at a highlevel very quickly and clearly so Ithink everyone understands this highlevel view at this point that's a goodcharacteristic not all designs have thatbut it also has some drawbacks and someof those drawbacks might be preventingus from adding features or or improvingfeatures that we want to do now when Ilook at a software design I try to havesmooth two perspectives and I try toshift back and forth between those twoperspectives one perspective is thesoftware designer software engineer typeof perspective this one I apply all theprinciples that you know that we havelearned about how to make softwaresomewhat clean and changeable and soforth for example with this set of eyesI might notice that there is a sideeffect here kind of a problematic sideeffect that as the routing Service doesits job one a very complex piece oflogic is also updating the database tocombine complex logic with a databaseupdate is basically a violation of anold principle of the separation of thelogic from updating state and that'sprinciple that goes back before domaindriven design as a name anywayso I would notice that in other thingsbut there's another perspective I wantto bring to it which is the domainperspective if I were talking about thisdesign with a person who is not asoftware developer but instead an expertin shipping how would I explain it tothemand it would start out much the same asthe way I talked about it with you Iwould explain how you give the routingservice an origin destination and a fewother things and then it will come upwith the stops that the cargo will haveto make and put them in the database andat this level communication is prettygood a shipping expert would understandthat would understand these kind ofcomponents of a software system and howthey interact but we need to get alittle more detail than that we can'talways have such high level discussionssuppose I wanted to discuss a an issuethat comes up sometimes I showed you anitinerary for a for a shipment thatlooks like a pretty good one butsometimes for various reasons you end upwith something like this so notice thatnow the cargo is unloaded in Long BeachCalifornia and then loaded onto thetrain in Sacramento California which ishundreds of miles away so how did it getfrom Long Beach to Sacramento well itwouldn't if we had an actual itinerarylike this in the system they wouldfollow the instructions of the itinerarywhen it arrived in Long Beach they wouldunload it but then when the time camefor the people in Sacramento to put iton the train they would look around forit and couldn't find it and theneventually someone would figure out whathad happened but what we want is to beable to notice when this happens andtake a corrective action and people talkabout this and they talk about thesekind of disconnect that ICenter Ares but how is it reflected inthe software as it exists well it isthere we have some relational integrityconstraints in the database table butwhen I start talking about this and thissolution I find that the I lose myconnection with the domain experts Ican't talk about this with a shippingexpert who doesn't really understandsoftware that well so we have to findanother way of dealing with this and away that gives us a design just as cleanand effective but written but maintainsthat communication so in these kinds ofcombining these two perspectives this ishow I want to think as I go forward nowI think about what concepts are wemissing that we are using when we talkto the domain expert we're all shiftingbetween two conceptual system betweentwo models two languages so to find thean alternative we need to somehow getinto a creative collaboration with thesesoftware experts I mean between thesoftware experts and the domain expertsand that's not so easy to do you can getsometimes you can get one of thesepeople into a room and got a nicewhiteboard and you say you know likewell what concepts are we missing hereand you know nothing will happen here sothe thing is that getting theseconversations started is quite difficultI'm going to talk about sort of thethings I often do kind of tell a littlestory of a typical way but but thatdoesn't mean this is the way it's doneand in fact later in the dayAlberto Brandolini is going to talkabout events swarming which is atechnique that it is among other thingsa great way to get a creativecollaboration going between those twokinds of people I think that's thethat's I think the the most excitingaspect of it to me actually so um butnonetheless here's here's kind of athing that I do is take this as a storyabout you know how it was done in thisparticular case first of all I like togo in with an idea or two you know tojust kind of start feeding the feedingthe conversation and where does thoseideas come from those well often youknow you're just popping with ideas ifyou've been working in the domain butone of the principles of domain drivendesign is that the language is veryimportant and one thing I've noticed isthat when we talk about our software wedon't use the same language that'sactually in the software so for examplehere let's compare the way I talkedabout this system even at the high levelwith the way it actually works so I saidgive the routing service an origin and adestination arrival time and if you lookat the diagram you will see that in factthat's exactly what happens I meantaking this diagram to be an accuraterepresentation of the software so so farso goodand then I say that the routing serviceit the routing service will look up thestops the cargo will have to make nowthe thing about that is that the wordstops does not appear in the diagram andwe can do a little search of the codeand so forth and we will find that stopsis never used in this way anywhere inthe software it might be in a label herethere so this is a concept so basic thatI use it to explain what the routingservice does what does the routingservice to you it looks up the stops thecargo has to me but that's not actuallywhat's happening in the softwarenot at least in those words so maybehere we have an ideathat could feed the conversation and soI could propose something I could saywell cargo we already have the cargoobject maybe the cargo object could havea series of stops now I propose this andmy shipping counterpart says yeah thatsounds good let's do it that way and soI feel good that I had a good idea nowwe can take this we can refactor thesoftware we can have a more a bettercommunication between the two types ofpeople and so forth and never look backactually this is often what happens andthat is another point where things cango awry because at this point I willhave lost a great opportunity the firstdecent idea that came along is often thelast idea because we latch on to it andwe stop thinking as a metaphor for thisthink about or a comparison anyway thinkof what you would do if you decided togo shopping for a car you might do alittle research and you'd say okay whatdo I need and you write down some thingsyou need I want to have a sedan withenough room for four people and so forthand so you go and I'd like to have it begreen and so you go to a dealer you saywell these are things I wanted one afour-door sedan I want it to be greenand and there are other constraintsthere too so the dealer says all rightwell here's a car over here that isgreen four doors it meets all yourrequirements and so you say okay I'lltake it is that how you shop for a carnow what you really do probably is yousay okay well let me test drive that carand then I'm going to go and shop aroundat some other cars too and then in theend it's actually possible that I willcome back and buy that carbut I would not feel good about buyingthat car having not looked at any otherswhat's the difference between buying acar and designing a piece of software Ican only think of two real differencesone is that the possibilities forsoftware are much broader and less wellunderstood so if I actually did buy thatcar or indeed pick a car at random thechances are that it would suit most ofmy needs that's the truth in 2019 Icould pick a car at random and it wouldsuit 90% of the needs that I have that'sprobably not true of a software designthe other thing is that most of the timesoftware development is quite a bit moreexpensive than buying a car so both ofthose though would suggest spending moreeffort trying to choose a software modelthan we do a car and specifically I meanlooking at more alternatives becausethere are lots of methods where peopleput a lot of energy into designing thesoftware but that energy doesn't usuallygo to looking at a broad range ofalternatives so somehow or other we'vegot to get some alternatives in thereand if I've been listening to the waypeople talk I realize that some peoplesometimes say that the car goesitinerary is a series of stops butsometimes they say that it's made up ofa sequence of legs so the cargo will soa leg will be like you know the partthat goes from Hong Kong to Long BeachCalifornia on a particular ship that'sone leg so maybe we should try that outso I'm going to throw that up there toonow this time the conversation has tochange the the shipping expert can'tjust say that's good do thatof course if legs that come first that'swhat would have happened but now it'smore of a conversation about well whyshould I use one versus the other ormaybe it will even trigger I find thataboutthree if you can get three it changesthe way people think from sort ofchoosing one to realizing that they'rejust looking at examples from a verylarge set and if you can get to thatpoint where you have that shift in yourmind where you realize you're looking atsamples from a very large set it gets tobe much easier to come up with morealternatives but it's not so easy to getthose first three I can do my littletrick again so for example what I saidearlier is that a car goes itinerary isa series of legs and that and I explainwhat a leg is but let's just ignore thebubble on the right do the trick ofcomparing what I say to the more formalin this case it's just a diagram on aboard we don't have real software butstill the diagram on the board hasalready diverged from the way I talkedabout it so look at that for a momentwhat is the difference and someone justpoint out a difference any differencethe so of the words I mean how did thewords not correspond to the diagram thecargos itinerary is a series of legs andI had that diagram the lower one sothere are two differences and I think Iheard them both come from various peopleone difference is that the diagram isless specific it doesn't say that thelegs are a series it just says it's acollection so we could fix that andthat's kind of a detail though I mean tosay it would be a good thing to fix butit isn't a fundamental change becausethe series is a collection but the thingthat really is missing is the worditinerary that is the statement doesn'tsay a cargo has legs in fact as anEnglish statement that sounds very weirda cargo has legs what sort of cargo haslegs maybe we're transporting liveanimals or something our chairs[Applause]yes I'm transporting chairs and my cargohas legs well that's not what this meansthat right that's a different sense oflegs so we need a we need to really takeseriously that we're not using the samelanguage and here's an observationI want to make I've used the worditinerary in this presentation manytimes but I don't think people weresitting there saying well why isn't heputting itinerary up as a as a conceptto use in our model you weren't thinkingthat nobody would think that becausewe're just used to hearing words and youknow we get the gist of what's beingsaid you get the meaning of what I'msaying but not paying enough attentionto the actual words themselves and Ithink that if you pay attention to thewords themselves gives you wonderfulclues to models that can really helpsolve the problems in the software soI'm going to add a couple more one wouldbe that a cargo would have an itineraryand that itinerary would have a sequenceof legs and another would be that itwould have a sequence of stops I can doit both ways so now I've got at leastfour distinct models and minorvariations around those and at thispoint hopefully we would have otherideas as well so but that's enough toget I think the sense of what I'm tryingto do here and notice that thesediagrams are written in a very informalstyle the point being that we don't wantto invest a lot in these ideas at thisstage we want quantity but not depth ofanalysis we can do the depth of analysislater if we need to but right now wewant to get broad that means in fact weneed some ideas we don't really have anyin this picture but we need some ideasthat are just bad you don't know ifyou've if you've really exploredof the problem unless our that ratherthan space of possible solutions if younever come up with a bad idea butbecause when I made this slide I was toofamiliar with the problem perhaps orjust to embarrass to show a really badidea I this isn't a good illustration ofthat principle all right so there's oneof the things you've got to generatesome variation but you've also got tokeep moving one of the things thathappens to people doing softwaremodeling is that they get and this isthe perfectionism again they get into aloop of just doing more and morespending time if you're not getting goodat ideas then move on to something elsecome back to it laterand don't be too finicky duh you know Idon't think you can really succeed inthis if you have a group of peoplethat's working on it where you willreally be where your where your prestigewill be lowered but by you putting up abad idea if you put up a model andeveryone says well look it's got thewrong kind of dependencies in it andthen you say oh well I'm sorry I'll goaway and never talk again if you're inthat kind of place this isn't gonna workso now also implicitly I think I've saidthat there would be more than onesession like this I don't like thesesessions to run on for hours and hoursan hour and a half is long enough atthat point you're not gonna have any newideas so you have to have multiplesessions and then people get to thequestion well what do you document aboutthis this is meant to be low cost so Iwould say that I would just look at theboard and say is there anything hereworth remembering that we would want tofeed into the next session and theanswer might be no it was a gooddiscussion but we don't need to keep anyof this and then you can just forgetabout it and schedule the nextmeeting and and be done here I think wedid get some things I would just saythose three words would be sufficientbut maybe the diagram of the cargoitinerary stop would be good to havethat would be enough and I might writethose in my design notebook and justleave it at that we don't have to have awiki documenting every idea that we haveand how we have to move on now at somepoint you're going to have to decideright generating variation it's veryimportant but then you have to selectfrom the variation so it's a verydifferent kind of thinkingdifferent mode of thought and alsodifferent criteria and I think differentpeople so one thing that I think isimportant too is that you have differentmeanings probably with different peopleto come up with the ideas or to selector most importantly to decide whether toactually use something so that's reallyI guess three different kinds of thingsbut the most important is when it comestime to actually decide and we'rethinking about oh should we actually dothis thing be sure to have a meetingwhere the stakeholders that would beaffected are there that might be the theproject manager might be another projectmanager from an effect you know anotherteam where your stuff is used if youdon't do this the next time you try tohave idea generating meetings you'llhave all those people there and youwon't be generating very many ideaswell anyway how do we choose a model andI don't mean forever necessarily but fornow so stopped your legs for examplelet's just boil it down to these twowe're gonna have a car go with anitinerary which stops or car with anitinerary with legs and just have a showof hands who thinks we should choosestops and who thinks we should chooselegsall right legs winsI think this would be a better processthan what we usually do what we usuallydo is we'll have some document with anice diagram in it and then at somefuture time a programmer will get astory card and it will have you knowrequire some of this functionality andthey'll do it some way that's about itor maybe they'll get the diagram with nokind of meaning and so they'll makethose objects but none of the none ofthe sort of kind of subtlety of theconcepts will come through so we can dobetter than that but before we do I wantto talk briefly about what I mean when Isay model because I've used the word alot of times but I haven't really saidwhat I mean and there are a lot ofmeanings to the word model and you guysknow many of them you can eliminate someof the obvious ones don't mean a tinyship in a bottle but there are forexample people often say model and theymean a UML diagram and I've used thenumber of UML diagrams but that's notwhat I mean what I really mean is theconcept behind that diagram so if welook at a map of the world we could saythat this is a kind of model of theworld and yet and it is but still it'snot quite the kind of model I mean Imean the model behind this map so take aquick look at the map and you can seethings like I don't know how big thingsare you could say the United States andChina and look about the same size andthey actually are approximately the samesize or you could look and see theGreenland and Africa about the same sizeso I suppose by extrapolation that theyare the same size oh I see someoneshaking their head so apparently they'renot the same size here's a different mapof the world this one shows Africa andGreenland and oh I guess they're notquite the same sizein fact Africa is 14 times biggerthen Greenland but they look the samesize on that map now is that because thepeople who made that map didn't know howbig Greenland was or perhaps theythought you know this is my pet theorythat got shot down by this xkcd comicbut my pet theory was that this map wasmade in the US you can tell because it'sright in the middle of the map and soyou know where it was made and thenthere was a there were some immigrantson the team that made the map fromGreenland and they said Americans aren'tvery good at geography and if we makeGreenland huge generations of Americanswill think that Greenland is big and sothat's what happened but actually itturns out that's not what happened theMercator projection is the reason nowwhy though did the Mercator projectionbecome so extremely popular that turnsout to be because it was very useful fora particular case which was important inthe 1590s when it was made which is thatif you make a map based on thisprojection you can draw a line betweentwo points and that line course but theangle of that line corresponds to acompass heading if you want to know whatdirection you know New York is fromLisbon you draw a line between New Yorkand Lisbon and if you pointed a shipthat direction and went in a straightline of course you wouldn't do that butit's a sort of starting point for anavigator so this map was really madefor use on ships by but then it was goodenough to use for many other purposesand sometimes you can even tell thingslike how big something is you can tellthat the US and Canada and China aboutthe same size because they're at aboutthe same latitude long as something's atthe same latitude you can compare thesizeif you wanted to you could compare thesize of Africa and Greenland by makingan adjustment based on the latitude itwould be a more complicated calculationso by choosing a model that is wellsuited for a particular problem you wantto solve you can make the complan makethe computation simpler or more complexthis one makes figuring out directionsvery simple but it makes figuring outthe size of things a bit complex butit's still possible to do if I wanted toknow the population of the US versusChina I could not do that with this mapno matter how complicated thecalculation was so there's these sort offactors now what is the model as I meanit well behind this model behind thatmap or other is the concept that theworld is round it's implicit in it butthat the world is round and that allwe're interested in is the surface andcertain points on that surface we're notinterested in the chemical makeup of theland or the anything about the magmaunderneath we're interested in where thecoastlines are so we need a way ofdescribing that a spherical coordinatesystem such as latitude and longitudethen we transform all our data into thatform then we need to convert it into aflat map or technically into a cylinderbecause you could pro Tate that map andwe need to do thisin a way because there are an infinitenumber of ways of transforming aspherical surface into a cylinder but weneed to do it in a way that preservesthe direction of two points relative toeach other there's only one way to dothat and it's the Mercator projectionthis is the model and if you take thatmodel I mean if you look at the piecesof it you see that here's an abstractionthis very complex and concrete thing theearth is abstracted as this simpleGeographthe geometrical figure and we aren'tusing all the data we have we're usingcertain kinds of data in this case thelocation of coastlines and rivers and soon using another abstraction torepresent it in terms of to the otherthat is latitude and longitude ismeaningful in relation to a sphere thenwe need some math to do thetransformation now I don't know exactlyhow Mercator did it's some kind ofgeometrical technique I'm sure withprotractors and stuff but the modern wayof expressing it is this function thisprojection function and then we can makean assertion and this assertion is wherethe power of the model comes from Icould take a different data set and Icould apply the same model and I get adifferent map this is marketers originalmaps this time Europe is in the centerspecifically Belgium is in the centerbecause Mercator was from Belgium butyou can see that the map is essentiallythe same a lot of details are differentbecause their data set wasn't as goodbut if you look at Europe andMediterranean and the data is prettygoodyou look over in North America and thedata is ok South America it's actually alittle better on the East Coast the westcoast of South America is weirdly sortof shifted to the east I think there'san offset error in the data and the westcoast of North America is kind of vagueit's like they knew there was a westcoast so they just sketched it in wecould call that an extrapolation or aninterpolation of incomplete data and boythis starts to feel to me like the kindof things we do on software projects wetake a data set that is imperfect thanincomplete we apply transformations tothat data that allow us toto make meaningful decisions thedecision in this case is which wayshould I point the ship so the domain isjust anything that you could know aboutbut the model is a system ofabstractions representing some selectedaspects of that domain this is a verybasic definition of model but I thinkanytime we start to get more concretemore hands-on than that we lose thepower of the model power the model isthat it is a set of concepts but it'snot neutral it distills some assumptionsand knowledge that we have that's andsome models are good for some thingsother models are good for other thingsthis is not a way of representingreality in fact I think realism is adistraction consider is this a realisticpicture of the world well you know wediscussed for example that Greenland isnot the size of Africamaybe this then is a more realisticpicture of the world Greenland andAfrica are in their proper perspectivesbut somehow the idea that you know ifyou went east from Africa you would justend up in space doesn't feel righteither so neither of these is realisticnor are they trying to be this is prettyrealistic picture of the world if I werea navigator at sea though I would ratherhave either of those other two than thisand I would much prefer the Mercator mapover the Dymaxion one but I would settlefor either rather than this veryrealistic picture realism doesn't giveus models that we actually can useanother thing about models is they needa narrow focus i googled for domainmodel and found thisthe web and I think there were some morecomplicated but this was all I couldreally fit on a slide completenessreally leads us off the track and yet wesay but we have all this information wehave to represent it somehow we have toget it into the computer and yes that'strue I could picture having a databasewhere we just say this database is forarchiving all the data we've got in somekind of canonical form but that's notthe kind of model I'm talking about ifyou're going to do that what you need todo then is have a separaterepresentation of that of some smallselection of that data that will be usedto solve specific problems in the domainand you'll transform the data back andforth and I think that is in fact therecommended thing that is we wantmultiple models from multiple problemswithin a larger domain so a model shouldbe focused on a specific difficultimportant problem this is obviously toohard to do for everything don't do thisfor everything do it for the hardproblems the ones that you don't thinkyou'd get right if you just startedwriting well if you know this then thisif you think you could get it rightdoing that then do that but if you don'tthink you could get it right doing thatmaybe a model would be helpful and forthat then you need to say well then thismodel would be helpful for what for aspecific use right a specific kind ofproblem this is one of the reasons thatI emphasize concrete examples earlier Iasked which is these two models you likebetter that's not really the rightanswer the question the question Ishould ask is which do you think wouldbe more useful and when I asked thequestion like that it might cause you tochange the way you're thinking and thinkwell useful for what what am I beingasked to do at using this model andthen my said well okay we need somescenarios some specific stories aboutthe business that tell us what we'regoing to use this thing for and I didtell you one I told you the initialbooking and you might say well for thatpurpose I think either these would befine I could describe the result of theinitial booking using the series ofstops an itinerary has a series of stopsor an itinerary has a series of legs Idon't think that would really be muchdifference so let me give you anotherscenario another thing we have to solveand I think it can be we can use thesame model for both of these sometimes acustomer will call up and say somethinglike I want to send my cargo to Dallasthen a little bit later they will say ohI want to send my car go to Seattle notto Dallas but by this time the ship isalready sailedthe cargo is somewhere in the middle ofthe Pacific Oceanif only they had called a few dayssooner we could have just done the wholething over again right then it's simplefrom a software point of view because wecan just undo everything we did and doit all from the beginning but now wecannot do that we need to do somethingto get rid of the legsI mean basically this ship is going togo to Long Beach California and then isour next chance to change anything ourcargo will be unloaded in Long Beach andwe could put it on something else wedon't want to put it on to the leg thatgoes to Dallas so we want to cancel thatleg and replace it with something elsenow the way that I am trying to explainthe problem might lead us to think thatthe leg model might be helpful for thisproblem because it's so natural to talkabout cancelling a leg from Long Beachto Dallas and replacing it with a legfrom Long Beach to Seattle but I can doit the other way and I will trybecause it's worth looking at ouralternatives we could cancel theunloading portion of the stop in LongBeach and stop in Dallas merge theremaining part of the Long Beach stopwith a load portion of the stop thatsets the cargo bound for Seattle and adda stop at the end that unloads inSeattle that's not so badhere's a pseudocode version of that andit is actually something you could dothis is not out of the realm ofreasonable solutions but here is thesolution with the leg and not only is itfewer steps but each one is lessconfusing it's not so much the number ofsteps here its how tricky some of thosesteps are the ones that involve taking astop apart putting it back togetheragain in the leg based one we takethings apart between you know we so backto our original design if we're going totransform this thing it did look likethis and now it's going to looksomething like thiswhen you you're still going to send theorigin and destination to the routingservice but instead of updating thedatabase it's going to create anitinerary pass that back notice that wenow have rid ourselves of thatside-effectthe routing service no longer needs toupdate the databaseI mean someone could make it so that itupdates the database and I imagine theywill if we don't communicate very wellbut this is a great opportunity toimprove the basic properties the sort ofarchitectural properties of the designand it comes from having a very explicitway to talk about the results of thiscomputation another thing we talkedabout earlier is the disconnecteditinerary remember now if we will bearpreviously we were putting integrityconstraints in the database and stufflike that but now that we have a littlemore way of describingthe result of routing we could talkabout how this could be done in terms ofthis model does this model lend itselfto telling you whether an itinerary isdisconnected I think there's a fairlystraightforward way of doing it so youcould say then an itinerary is connectedwhen the end location of each leg is thesame as the start location of the nextleg that's very natural you can talkabout that with a businessperson andfind out perhaps it does not really whatthey mean or find out that yes you'vegot it right and that looks almost likepseudocode right you could say yeah Icould code that now it looks so muchlike pseudocode that I want to point outsomething I don't mean when I say anitinerary is connected when don't meanI'm describing the calculation that youshould do what I'm really hoping to dois define a new word that will be partof our language and in a new concept inother words I'm saying that the model isnot just those three objects a cargo anditinerary and some legs it's not justthose objects it's also it describes theway those objects are related to eachother so for example one of theproperties that an itinerary might haveis is it connected and that's part ofthe concept of an itinerary it's notjust a calculation that we can do but itdoes correspond to a calculation we cando being able to but being able to stepback from the calculation and say thisis actually a concept in that sense thatI talked about what is the model earlierthat's a very key thing we're not justrearranging the code in some way when weget to this point where we can talkabout the solution that we have talkedabout our software the same way withanother software person as we can with abusiness person and where we can haverealquestions with them about the thingsthat need to be done and how we might dothem differently we call that theubiquitous language the Invictuslanguage is one of those fundamentals ofdomain-driven design you can seethroughout the whole example that I'veemphasized language looking at how wetalk about the problem as beingfundamental to finding a good solutionso ubiquitous language is one of thosethree or four concepts one thing aboutthat word that phrase ubiquitouslanguage is that it kind of conveys ayou know ubiquitousness in the wholesense that your whole system wouldrevolve around one language and that isemphatically not what we mean so I liketo append ubiquitous language is thiswithin a bounded context I'm not goingto talk about bounded context right nowbut Cyril will in a couple of hours Ican't remember exactly when he was inthe agenda so we go into depth on thatconcept but the idea is basically thatwe will have multiple models withdistinct languages and that that wholeassembly of models will provide us withthe solution to the various problemsthat we have so getting back to thequestion of why do this stuff I thinkthat the answer lies in complexitywithin the domain itself sometimes wehave complexity in the technicalsolutions that we need to do if we wereperhaps if we were say in the early daysof creating Twitter Twitter is prettysimple in its logic but especially earlyTwitter was but at the time the ideathat you would send out millions ofmessages in a timely way to someone'syou know to the followers all thosethings that was a real challenge at thattime now because of the frameworks thatthey created and made public it's notactually that hard to donow if I wanted to go create somethingon the scale of Twitter I think I coulddo it all by myself that probablycouldn't get very many people to sign upthough but the point being then that theTwitter of that time would not have metthis criteria right it the criticalcomplexity that they were dealing withwas a technical scaling complexitywhereas most of the time on the projectsthat I've been working on the criticalcomplexity is in the domain itself it isthat shipping is very complex and if wedo our job rightour software might not actually be morecomplex than shipping itself but if weare not careful our software might bemuch more complex than the actualshipping domain and because the actualshipping domain probably pretty close tothe minimum complexity that we can hopefor right well that is basically my timebut I want to just touch on one otherthing suppose that instead of presentingthe the the scenario that I did as thesecond scenario where in mid transitthey changed the destination supposeinstead I said well we're still on ouroriginal itinerary but we're about toarrive at the first port and we need togenerate these purchase orders to the totell the people in the port's how toactually unload the cargoes what to dowith each cargo and there are thesecompanies that operate in ports and weneed to figure out which one to sendeach instruction to and we need to getthe whole story of each of thousands ofcargoes right criss-crossing through anenormous complex port and when you lookat this problem you start to think wowthe things that happen in the port aremore complicated than the thingshappening in the routing of the shipmaybe my model should be reared aroundthat and that might point me to the stopsmall because stop has a very explicitplace to talk about the port the stoprepresents everything that happens in aport the leg says everything thathappens between the ports it literallyhas no place to put information aboutwhat's happening in the port and so youwould have ended up with a quitedifferent modelit isn't like we're converging to thebest model we are converging to a modelvery path dependent depending on theparticular problems that we are tryingto solve and the order in which we tryto solve them and the ideas that happento come up during that process so if youencounter a different sort of problemlater on you have some choices you couldsay well let's bite the bullet andchange the stops nowand you're accepting that your solutionto the routing problem will be slightlymore complex remember I said though it'snot out of the question right it'sdoable but we'll reserve our bestchoices for the most difficult problemwhich is the one in port or maybe thisis time for two bounded context I'llsolve route related problems over herewith legs we'll have another place wherewe can solve problems in ports usingstops and I'll have to transform thedata back and forth back and forthbut that's doable two or a third choicewhich is stick with legs and go aheadand cram the new functionality on theresomehow you know I can deal with thefirst vendor on the unload of the letyou know the incoming leg and the lastvendor on the outgoing leg then I'lljust put all the other vendors onto theincoming leg because I've gotta gosomewhere and that is also sometimes avalid choice but especially worthmentioning because it is the defaultchoice that's the choice you make if youdon't recognize that there's a choice tomake and that's a choice that gets madeall the time in fact I think probably onmost projects it's sort of a timed thinghow long is it before you make thatchoice and once you've made that choiceyou're kind of stuck because you have amodel that noor fits the most difficult problems aretrying to deal with so you're notgetting much benefit from model andthat's the last thing I'll say before Iturn it over to the next person rememberthat having a model doesn't actuallygive you any advantage as such theVantage doesn't come from having a modelthe advantage comes from having a modelthat is a very nice fit to the specificset of problems that you are trying tosolve in that context if you have amodel no matter how nice its propertiesmight be in an abstract sense but itdoesn't fit the particular problems thatyou are trying to solve it will not giveyou any benefit it might be fightingagainst you so I'll go on out on thatpoint and I hope that this examplehelped to illustrate kind of the spiritof domain driven design and I'll leaveit to the other guys to go into thevarious more detailed parts of it sothank you[Applause]youyou",
    "summary": "Eric Evans's talk \"What is Domain Driven Design\" at DDD Europe 2019 outlines the core principles and motivations behind Domain-Driven Design (DDD). He emphasizes that DDD is about creating software that effectively addresses important real-world problems. A key tenet is to avoid perfectionism and continually question assumptions, as the ultimate goal is functional software, not theoretical purity. Evans uses a container shipping company example to illustrate how to approach software development within a complex domain. He highlights the importance of acknowledging existing software and the constraints it imposes.\n\nThe heart of DDD lies in bridging the gap between software engineers and domain experts through a shared, \"ubiquitous language.\" This involves a creative collaboration to identify missing concepts and refine the software model. Evans advises experimenting with multiple models, not settling for the first decent idea, and avoiding premature investment in any single concept. He stresses the importance of the actual language used in software being consistent with the language used to describe the problem. The presenter also emphasizes the importance of modeling by comparing abstract data to an example such as the Mercator projection map.\n\nEvans concludes by defining a model as a system of abstractions representing selected aspects of the domain. The model should be focused on a specific, difficult, and important problem. He states that the advantage of DDD is that it provides a way to solve complex problems in ways that makes the software not more complex than the problem itself. Models are not neutral, they distill assumptions and knowledge, and they are useful only when they fit the specific problems being solved. Using DDD doesn't inherently provide advantage, the best models fit the exact need. The best models emerge when they naturally describe the language used to discuss the problem at hand."

youneed it great thanks thank you so muchhi everyone um I'm Peter I'm going tokind of take things in a bit more of aphilosophical kind of Direction um youknow I work for a research lab thesedays so that's kind of my uh tendency umthe lab is called Inc and switch uh weare interested in carrying on kind ofthe work of like engelbart and lick lierand Alan Kay and these people weinterested in how computers can augmenthumanintelligence and uh you know that's veryhigh futin it's a lot of fun we get todig into all kinds of weird corners ofsoftware and experimental interfaces andso on but before that I have written alot of production software so I'm notjust speaking to you from kind of anivory Tower perspective I was one of theearly employees at a platform as aservice company uh called Heroku I'verun a lot of postrest databases I'veworked in game development as well I'vebuilt titles for DS and GBA I worked onthis one teenage Zombies Invasion of thealien brain thingies for a Victoria BCgame company and I've worked on desktopsoftware like uh Songbird which was acrossplatform media player that lostfairlydecisively um and besides that I've alsouh worked in uh research um spendingsome time uh on for example this shiphere this for Wilford laor it's aCanadian Arctic uh research Icebreakerso I spent some time in the Arctic andthat actually helps inform myperspective on things too but we'll comeback to that so I want to start by kindof saying hold on a sec before we getinto kind of talking about why we can'tmake simple software we should probablyDefine our terms a little bit and talkabout what complexity actually is so thefirst thing I want to clarify is thatcomplexity is not difficultyright just because something is harddoesn't mean it's complicated like theideas of calculus might be verydifficult to internalize but they'reactually very simple and elegant and Ialso want to draw a distinction betweensomething being complex or just beingkind of big a box of Lego is notnecessarily a complicated thing thoughyou can make a lot of things with itcomplexity occurs when your systemsinteract with each other okay and whenit takes a lot to uh get things donebecause of that and more specifically Ithink the problem with complexity isthat your systems can becomeunreasonable and when I say unreasonableI don't mean in kind of like a sort ofcolloquial sense what I mean is that youliterally cannot reason about them youdon't have the ability to predict what'sgoing tohappen and a lot of the time that's aproblem because you got work to do andthe thing is crashing and you don't knowwhy but a complex system can also begenerative and surprising if you harnessthat complexity in positiveWays last before we get into it I wantto make just a very small uh detailpoint for the uh more pedantic in theaudience some people draw a uh veryspecific difference between uh complexsystems from sort of chaos math and likeemerging complexity we'll talk a littlebit about that H as distinguished fromcomplicated systems where you have a lotof just kind of mess I'm kind kind ofgoing to float back and forth acrossboth of these without a lot ofDistinction because I think in thiscontext either one can cause similareffects okay so we're going to beginwith a non-comprehensive look atcomplexity and more specifically we'regoing to kind of like pick some cherrypick some examples sort of from fakeindustrial sort of scenarios where youcan begin with something simple and endup with something complicatedso I'm going to start with like the mostbasic of all reasons why your softwaregets complicated and that's you know thefirst version of your code you justwrite the happy path everything'sglorious and and software can be reallysimple when it lives in an idealizedworld and everything is fine and so youknow here's like a really simpleimaginary you know pseudo code web thinggreat we got a get request to ourapplication you know we're going to gofetch something from the database andsay hello there this is a Hello Worldapp of web apps server apps great itworks fine you know if user 12 is me anduser 10 is my friend KO and user fu iswait what ahright we got to validate the input okayso we'll validate therequest now okay so we're validating therequest and and that's good and oh geezI'm not really handling it if we don'tvalidate the request and wait do I haveto do this on every request I guess Ihave to do this on every request and amI doing it the same way on everyrequest in fact this exact pattern ofvalidating user input and checking yourarguments can lead to something that uhbratus and Patterson call shotgunparsing and shotgun parsing is kind ofthe idea that you know you're parsingyour input but it's like someone's takena shotgun to your code base because it'sjust blown through the whole code baseand it can lead to very serious securityvulnerabilities because you mightcarefully check an input in one placebut not in another and a great talk frombrwon 2012 aboutthis so of course you know now we'regoing to be a little more careful sowe're going to also you know if thedatabase is down we don't want to send a500 we're going to fail elegantly and asyou go the more of these cases that youhave to handle and the better thequality of your code is right the moreconservative defensive thorough that youare like at this point now like the theactual logic of this method is beginningto dis disappear into all the edge casehandling right we're we're well off thehappy path now and so you know you canclean this up a little bit so forImagine here in this case that you knowwe have a slightly uh better set oflibraries more thoroughly written set oflibraries we've moved the complexitydown out of this method and we're sortof saying like well the database won'tthrow an exception right becauseexceptions are ugly and kind of subtleto handle well it'll just it'll returnnull if it can't do the job for whateverreason and we're going to say well we'llyou know there's like a good type systemthat's handling parsing the input argsbefore they get to us so you know we canwe don't have to worry about thatanymore and the value ofwell-written uh libraries and languagestype systems and so on is that they canreally simplify your code make it lesscomplex by preventing you from have tocarry around all of this mental stateeverywhere that yougo and you know kind of my observationof this world is that like vigilance isnot a strategy like we talk earlierabout how you know if a system failsit's not oh the blameless postmortemit's not that the the developer failedit's that the system failed you know ifyou have security vulnerabilities inyour code because you didn't handleinput the answer isn't to berateyourself for not handling the input youknow it's to step back to level up andsay like well hold on why do I have todo this manually everytime so so to strategically you want tominimize the scope of failures and andkind of design them out of your systemand one way to do that is have a typesystem so you don't you know forget tocheck your nulls there are otherapproaches I don't think this isuniversally true but it's one way okayso let's talk about scale you know weall know as an array gets bigger you canhave an O of n log n kind of sortalgorithm great okay well let's you knowscale's easy right so let's just imaginean admin panel for a web application youlist your users looks kind of like thisgo to your database select all the usersand then in your front end just showthem all perfect easy it's fine you'veonly got 10 users who caresokay well now we're at 10 to the fourokay you've got a thousand users or sookay well okay we can't just render allthat on one screen okay well uh we'regoing to use one of those offset SQLthings right we know about this and thenwe're going to need pagination I guessand you got to click through okay yeahsure we can still do this this is fineyeah you don't want to request all thatit's pain to scroll through okay wellnow we're 10 to the six users we got amillion actually that offset thingthat's a problem if you have a lot ofusers because in order to generate youknow page 8850 it actually selects allof those rows and Scrolls through themand just takes all of those results andjust Chucks them on the floor until itgets the ones that you asked about andactually now even though nothing haschanged about our problem statement likenot only are the performancecharacteristics of the system startingto change and the user interface isstarting to change but the the way thatwe interact with the problem is changingtoo because if you've got a millionusers the way to find a user is not tojust like keep clicking next until youfind them one page after oh page 350okay I'm on the J's Okay click forwardto change the query AR to force youwe've all done these kinds of thingswhen the tools didn't keep up with ouradmin systems but like the point I'mtrying to make here is that you knowonce you start to reach like a 100million users you know it's not even thesame kind of problem anymore right thecomplexity that snuck in here is nowthat we have different responsibilitiesthere are ethical there are legal thereare policy responsibilities you probablyhave a team of people at yourorganization who are responsible fordealing with abuse some of these peopleare terrible and you want them off yourplatform and you can't find them rightlike it's a different thing and it'scomplicated because the environment haschanged as much as anythingelse so everything changes when yourscale changes it's not just like analgorithmic thing it's also the kinds ofthings that you're doing change and likein general my advice to someone who'sbuilt a lot of high-scale productionsystems through many orders of magnitudeis that it's as harmful to build for thesystem of the future as it is to buildan insufficient system for the presentyou know if you build the tools for 100million users when you have a hundredusers they're going to be completelyunusable too and you're going to wasteso much time trying to solve problemsyou don't have yet that you're going tomiss out on all the benefits of beingable to just look at all your users andsee who they are and talk to them rightso you need to be scale appropriate andkind of be lookingahead another way software can getcomplicated is with leaky abstractionsand so here we have a platform that's alittle bit skewed um and so complexitycan kind of Bubble Up from under thewater line through these imperfectextractions abstractions this is how youcopy a string it's a nice handmadelowlevel this is an exerp from cariganand Richie 1988 second edition theprogramming language and this book wassuch a revelation for me like how itshowed me the way colonel uh functionswere reallyimplemented no I'm just kidding they'renot really implemented like this andthey say here that this is how you knowa c programmer would prefer to writestring copy the C programmer in questionhas never forgotten to null terminate astring I see um but this is how stringcopy is actually implemented as of 2022for Alpha in uh in Linux and actuallythis isn't how string copy isimplemented this is like one page ofassembler uh there's like 300 lines ofassembly and really importantly and andintriguingly although the interfaceRemains the Same modern CPUarchitectures have so many moreconstraints around memory alignment andeverything else that although theinterface is preserved you can pass anypointers in and get values back the kindof performance characteristics of likedoing an unaligned versus an alignedstring copy will be dramaticallydifferent and so complexity here rightlike I think we can kind of call this awin right like we've got thissuperpowered computer under the hood nowbut it still kind of feels like that oldgalap they were running in 1988 you knowand like that's cool that that it worksbut in a sense this API that's so simpleis actually undermining the value of thesystem and there's a lot of magichappening to kind of hide this and so Ifeel very mixed about this because onthe one hand you know it's sort of likeSQL databases where like you can add anIND and change nothing else and thingsget faster but there's like a reallyimportant subtle like lie that's beingtold here but maybe this is good andmaybe it's bad this is like a valuejudgment kind of question and whetheryou understand this is happening couldbe completely irrelevant or it could bethe difference between the success andfailure of aproject okay so these are kind of liketechnical complexities that come in Iwant to talk about other sources ofcomplexity different kinds of complexityand one really big source of complexityin my projects maybe your smarter thanme and that's cool uh but it's when youhave a gap between the problem you thinkyou have or the problem you used to haveand the problem you have right now andagain we're going to use a toy exampleto illustrate this so you've got a userstable just same app as before and youknow your users there's a bunch offields you got a first name and a lastname and how do you get the first nameand the last name it'seasy guys you just split on aspace as a vanhardenberg uh you can see how this mightget you in trouble and in fact on myCalifornia driver's license it said thatmy middle name was van for manyyears and the problem here is that themodel that you have for the problemdoesn't actually map the problem domainsuccessfullyso what do you what do youdo right and there are lots of thingsyou can do you can rewrite from scratchyou can patch around it and actuallyjust as an aside for everybody in theroom the w3c has a wonderful um essayabout personal names around the worldand just you know if you take one likelittle thing from this talk um don't usefirst name and last name don't usefamily name people's family names aren'taccurate some people have them andothers don't uh what you do is you haveone field that is you know what is thefull name and then the other one is ifyou need it what should we call you umit's like a much bettermodel um alsoUnicode I know that's its own set ofcomplexity but uh and so you knowthere's only so many things you can dowhen you have this problem right andlike I had a really specific concreteexample of this in a distributed systemrecently where like I had a mental modelof how the system behaved and my testsdemonstrated that it behaved that wayand then in my production environment itbehaved completelydifferently because of behaviors thatwere not modeled by my understanding ofthe problem and this is part of whydistributed systems are so prone to thisis because there's so many new freevariables and and like articulationpoints where things can be fast or slowor where they can fail or you knowarrive out of order and all these kindsof things and so when you have thesekinds of model reality gaps you have tobridge them somehow and so what can youdo well you can fix the problem you canimprove your understanding and rewriteeverything and like when you can do thatit's probablybest you can't really always do thatthough and more to the point you maystill not actually you could see theproblem but you may still not actuallyunderstand the solution right and sowhat can you do well you can hack aroundit right like I've put van hardenberginto a lot of text boxes without a spacein it and you know where the firstletter is capitalized and the H islowercase and that's not how I spell myname but it is how a lot of systemsspell my name you know or you can ignorethe problem right like maybe it's fineand like genuinely it could be fine foryour use case you're just like well Iguess you know that Peter guy can suckit he'll deal with having his namespelled wrong and I do you know it'sthese are options that you have andthere's like a great you know like memeseries out there on the internet liesprogrammers believe about pretty muchanything like all time zones are 1 hourapart uh half an hour later in Newanlandand so Ithink this is a this is a veryfundamental source of complexity butwhere things get really bad is when yourproblems start to multiply off eachother and this of course is you knowwhere you have kind of like compoundinterest on complexity so what happensif your problems um dimensionalizeagainst each other so again imagine thisweb application you've got a bunch ofdifferent browsers to support you've gota bunch of different runtimeenvironments to support different screensizes Network speeds different Os orbrowser versions and so if you want toactually understand what's happening youknow all of these things multiplyagainst each other right and so youdon't just have one runtime environmentyou might have one codebase but you havelots of different contexts so how canyou know that you actually have correctfunctioning code because you know theold joke about Docker like well itworked on my computer well I guess we'llship your computer well even thatdoesn't really work because once you getout into the real world there'sdifferent memory you know contexts oryou're up against different loads orwhatever else right you don't actuallycontrol the wholeenvironment and so this is what reallystarts to kill you with complexity rightand it's where all of those smallerinconsistencies play off each other tocreate an unknowableslike you don't use the native apisbecause God help you if you're trying tolike figure out how to map all of thesetotally different environments down toone consistent thing and like onesolution here is just to only have onething as best you can and to minimizethe difference between thoseenvironments and that's why you see sortof like ostensibly lazy electron appsfrom big companies because even worsethan having to support all thesedifferent things is having to coordinateall the different people and teams totry and build features right and we'veall many of us have been there rightlike if you have an iOS and an Androidteam like how do you get them to shipthe same feuture in the same quarterright it's tough it'stough okayso I hope I've convinced you now um thatcomplexity is like a a complex problemitself and that it manifests in a lot ofdifferent ways so we're going to changegears a little bit and talk about seatbelts and more specifically why seatbelts don't savelives and I haven't asked risk herebecause this is a little bit of acontroversial um research topic um butthe sort of upshot of this is that in atleast some studies they found that afterseat belts became mandatory incars uh people still died on the roadsat similar rates and that was reallysurprising becauselike you know seat bels are are a goodidea like they keep you safer in the carand so somebody proposed this idea uhcalled riskhomeostasis the idea behind riskhomeostasis is that actually we die at arate on the road related to how muchrisk we're willing to take and so if younow have a seat belt and you're drivinga car that's safer you're going to go alittle faster and you're going to takethe corners a little tighter because youfeel better right so the the issue withmaking people safer was that they thentook on more risky Behavior conservingtheir total risk tolerance and so Ithink we see a similar thing in softwareright we I call this complexityhomeostasis which is to say that if youhave kind of a system that's evolvingover time you know everything's finewe're going along life is good and thenwe add some more things and you knowwe're still happy and then oh oh yeahnow it's I don't like itanymore it's not good it feels bad nowit's time for that rewrite that we werehearing about right it's time to bringthings backah okay now we can go back to makingthings complicated againand so this is kind of like a set pointso homeostasis is the process where orit's any process where you sort ofmaintain a set point and it's commonlyused to talk also about how our bodiesregulate temperature but I think ourorganizations regulatecomplexity right and so all of us havedifferent intuitions and when peopletalk about wanting things to be simplethere's like an aesthetic preferencehere and different people perceive thatand pursue thatdifferently and like Deen's you knowquest for just the right number of opcodes that we heard about yesterday is agreat example where like in a certainsense you know the correct number of opcodes is one and you could do that ifyou really wanted to but then you've gotkind of like the CIS you know modelwhere actually the correct number ishundreds because you're maintainingbackwards compatibility and anythingthat can squeeze you you know eitherbetter numbers out of a bench ParkBenchmark or more CPU sales is isacceptable and so you know how youperceive what constitutes complexity orhow much complexity you're willing totolerate is an individual or anorganizational decision and you knowsome things can actually move that uplike I have abandoned projects becausethey got complicated and annoying towork on but like some people might justtolerate that and not perceive it I'veworked with some brilliant people whowrite the most complicated insaneconvoluted code from my perspective butwhen I sort of go to them I'm like thisis so complicated and weird why did youdo it this way they don't see it becausethey're just much smarter than methey're they're able to hold thatcomplexity in their head comfortably andso for them it doesn't feel that wayanother way a system can become morecomplicated if it's worth a lot of moneyright because like you can just hireanother poor Schmo to sling Java intothe code base I mean has anybody hereworked on an EA Sportstitle yeah I'm sosorry I have heard some things man andit ships every year on on Deadlinewithout fail right like that's not anenvironment that leads to like healthyrefactoring or or reduction ofcomplexity but you know what it makes aboatload ofmoney and so they'll hire people to workon it because they can afford to andyou'll work on it because they'll payyou enough because they know theyknow right and so part of this as wellis that also if you just have morepeople working on things you know youcan tolerate more complexity I can holdpart of it in my head and you can holdpart of it your head and I kind of wantto distinguish like there's sort of thebreadth of complexity and if you have awell- factored system you can decomposethe complexity either into layers or ormodules right like each individual Legobrick is simple but you can build verycomplicated things from it right and sothat's sort of the system complexityversus the component complexity CSS isincredibly complicated and by that whatI mean it's complex you can't tell fromlooking at one rule what it willmanifest as in a finaldocument so okay well we can just solvethis problem with better tools rightwell no because as we've talked about weyou know we have this homeostasis pointthat we fall towards over time and wecan choose where to set it but we domove towards it and you know theresearch on this actually goes all theway back to like the 1860s this is uhJeff's Paradox which was like why didcoal consumption not decrease whenengines became more efficient the answeris people did more work right and so Ifeel very much that this is sort of theinevitable conclusion we have to drawfrom looking at the problem which isthat the degree of complexity of asystem is tied to who we are and whatwe're doing overtime right and so when we buy back somecomplexity by using better tools or bypicking a simpler environment we'regoing to spend that out againeventually okay so let's talk a littlebit about some theories of complexitybecause you know this I'm from aresearch lab and I like to like readpapers so this is not a new this is nota new problem uh have have people heardof[Laughter][Applause]cost and be problematic is worththinking about in fact people have beenlooking at this and thinking about itsince the 1980s this is uh mayor limanin 1980s uh i e volume 68 so like thisis not a new domain and so even backthen this this Edition was from 1980 thefirst paper published was in 1974 onthese laws of software engineering we'renot going to read these like super closethere it's more that I want you torealize that like this kind ofrecognition that systemsgrow to meet growing needs if they'resuccessful is not a new idea it's acommon problem and whether you'reworking you know in building tools orlanguages you know you might start withan elegant and simple thing but as asystem has more demands on it itresponds by adding right that's that's avery common and it's a reasonableconsequence and if you don't do thosethings the thing will often sort ofstarve anddie um one great paper if you haven'tread it yet on this sort of topic is outof the tarpit by Mosley this is from 06and uh this paper differentiates betweenwhat is like accidentally complex versusessentially complex right so likeessential complexity is like theirreducible like non- illimitable partof your system you know if you aretrying to model certain physicalprocesses like you know smoke or firelike the physics part where you'reactually doing the work you can't getrid of that you don't want to get rid ofthat that's what you're here for rightbut The Accidental complexity is allthat other stuff like oh God we got tocompile this so it works on like Windows11 has changed the ABI for this DL welike all that stuff where you you knowwe heard about deine hoisting the um uhphone up the uh the Mast to download 11gigs ofsomething right that's mostly accidentalcomplexity for our purposes and so ithelps as you're working and thinkingabout complexity to to think about whereyou're spending that budget and whetherit's whether you're being deliberate interms of how you're adoptingcomplexity the other thing I want to uhrefer to is this great um this greatessay from the Berkeley DB team in thearchitecture of Open Source and honestlyyou I highly recommend reading this ifyou just like software engineering thearchitecture of Open Source software isis a a cool series and basically whatthey do is interview open sourcecommunities about their software andhave them write essays about whatthey've done and then they publish andshare those but I think this Berkeley DBchapter in particular is exceptional andI I think about this all the time whichis that software architecture degradeswith changes made to software right soyou might have the most elegantbrilliant carefully planned system inthe world but it does not exist at asingle point in time in a vacuum and asnew demands come along this architecturewill Decay and so requires a constantShoring up and when you have biginterfaces that you've invested heavilyin and they're straining it can beextremely expensive to changethem I also just love this this is alittle more handmade specific kind ofvibe the Excel team motto at leastaccording to Joel spolski is find yourdependencies and eliminatethem uh I have been told on reasonablygood authority that Excel uh actually isbuilt with its own C compiler that theythey didn't even want to rely on otherteams within Microsoft and you know tothe degree where they've built their owncompilers I'm not saying you necessarilyshould do that I'm not saying younecessarily shouldn't you got to thinkabout how you're spending yourbudget and the last kind of point I wantto make sort of on this theme is againthat complexity isn't necessarily badright like complexity can lead to allkinds of like wonderful emergentproperties right you the Legend ofZelda um you know breath of the Wildit has had so such a wonderful Communitygrow up around it precisely because theymanaged to tame complexity with theirchemistry engine so there's a lot ofemergent gameplay properties andexperiences that come out ofinteractions complex interactionsbetween systems but the systems arefactored in a way that enables andempowers this um and of course if you'rea Rog likee fan you know people havebeen doing this foreverthere okay so how well now whatyou know we we've we have now looked atcomplexity I've told you you can't getrid of it so we're just going to have tolive with it and you know better toolswon't save us so how are we going tospend this this complexity budget thatwehave I mean you know one approach is youjust put your head down and you workaway and and pretend it's not a problemand you know that that's a pretty commonsolution to all of our problems in lifeso we could do that but I'm going tomaybe try and propose a few ways we cancut the gordian knot here and so um youknow the the story of the gordian knotwas that there was this sort of um thisOx cart with a really complicated knoton the the handle and people were likeoh whoever whoever unties this nototwill rule all of Asia and many peoplehad come and then Alexander the Greatcame along and depending on the versionof the story you hear he just like helike okay cool and he cut it with aknife right and so instead of solvingthe problem by like trying to be reallysmart or work really hard like can wejust cheat and change the rules like Ithink that's a betterapproach so one approach is to do whatfolks here like to do is just start overyou know you can't actually get rid ofthis problem but you can reset the clockon it right just build a new one startfrom the beginning everything's easy inthe beginning it's only when you haveusers and features that you havecomplexity so like you know make a newprogramming language start a new VM it'sgood you can't really change this likelong run pressure but like genuinely youcan reset the clock and I think that'spart of why things like Excel arepopular and successful is they don'thave package managers right like everytime you make a new Excel document it'sa brand new universe you know with nonenone of the misery or mistakes that youmade before it's like the Forgiveness ofthe blank page you know that's andthere's something to that um I went to atalk by John Romerouh at strange Loop not that long ago andhe talked about how ID software had beenmaking these like shovelware games foras contractors or the the ID softwareteam him and him and uh Romero and carachad been making these sort of shovelwaregames and their attitude was like wellyou should just always start fromscratch you get really good at it youcan be really fast and each time you doa little bit better than the one beforeand we do I think do better I like I'mnot I I love learning new languages andbuilding new ecosystems and I think abig part of the reason why they'resuccessful is because when you have anew language you do have the opportunityto like clear away um like the standardlibrary and also just the ecosystem ofideas and people and sort of start froma fresh starting point now this won'tcure complexity in the long run but youknow it can get better right at least inthe midterm and we can get further so Ithink you know that's pretty cool andit's also pretty fun so like I'm I'm allfor that please please do more of thatandto some extent it's sort of like youknow it feels like we live in these uhunbreakable regimes where like Unity youknow rules or where like the bigcompanies Google and Microsoft andeverybody rules but that's the kind ofthing that's true until it isn't andthere's this lovely quote from Ursulalwin about capitalism which is sort ofyou know the generalization of theseproblems you know capitalism was itselfan invention and um you know I'll justread it we live in capitalism M itspower seems inescapable so did thedivine right of kings and any humanpower can be res resisted and changed byhumanbeings right so we we should not doubtthat the environment can be changed theenvironment was created it will bechanged we don't know how or when but itisinevitable okay so you can start overRevolution burn itdown or you know just do ldo less with less uh do I have my playdate does do people have these hasesanybody got a play date yeah this isgreat it's black and white it it'sthere's only one platform it's small itcomes in one color it only has one colorblack or white depending on how youthink about it doesn't have a lot ofbuttons doesn't have much RAM doesn'treally have any there's a little bit ofnetworking and there's only one Hardwareplatform so you don't have to worryabout compatibilityproblems isthere there is the emulator whichbehavesdifferently and due to like sourcingproblems they had to get a differentmicro controller but it transpilesnatively they're doing a really good jobanyway it's a heck of a lot simpler thanbuilding for PS5 you know Xbox PC switch3DS all on one code base like it isgenuinely awesome and because it's sosmall it's like you know kind ofappealing and when you have less scopeyou can choose to spend that energy thatcomplexity budget you can put it intopolish right and like on a smallplatform a small idea canshine so okaywell we can't solve complexity but wecan make thingsworse this is actually from augmentingHuman intellect uh by angelart in 1962and it's demonstrating um that you knowyou can in fact change people'sexperience um with uh designinterventions I said change notimprove so you you can we we've madethings pretty bad in terms of softwaredevelopment this is the uh my favoriteslide always to show this is the uhCloud native cloudcloud Foundation Cloud native landscapeI always get this wrong um this isostensibly I think 20 trillion worth ofcompanies anyway please memorize all ofthis it'll be quiz at the end if youwant to make a web application in2022 I had to zoom out the browser justto fit it all on screen for thefun so I'm going to talk a little bitnow about our research which kind ofties back into this because I think itmight be interesting um our approach isless the kind of like reboot uh uh modeland more of the maybe do a little lesswith less model and one of our sort ofresearch interests kind of Builds onthese sort of tools tools for thought abig part of um what we're interested inas a research group is not Simplicityversus complexity or decentralization oranything like that but we do find thatwe have to work in that space becausewhat we want are tools that we haveagency over that we have ownership ofthat are ours and can't be taken and sowe call our research there uh localfirst software and the idea is basicallythat instead of having to go learn thatwhole chart of Technologythat you know you can't actually do anyof that stuff if you just run it on yourcomputer cuz that stuff's all in thecloud so if you want to build softwarethat works on yourcomputer not only do you not get to useall that stuff you don't have to use allthatstuff and so this you know it's sort oflike simplification like viaamputation so we just cut off most ofthe cloud and then we build things Loand so you know we've dabbled in a bunchof different platforms over the years umright now we're building things in thebrowser but storing everything in likeindexdb but one of our kind of corebeliefs is that um you knowcollaboration is such an important partof um thinking and making and doing thatit should be like a really fundamentalpart of our platforms and so we've beenexploring technology that allows you tobuild software that runs on yourcomputerbut then collaborates with other peopleyou know even allowing online offlinekind of cuts and um the the modelunderpinning that is a a data structurecalled automerge it's sort of like aportable versioned Json like datastructure you could think of it as likeget for your data um I I don't I'm happyto talk at length about this stuff uhbut I don't really want to Harang youtoo much on you know sort of ourparticular kind of like developmentinterests but uh it's really incrediblejust like how it feels to build softwarethat's fast and simple and runs on yourcomputer if you like me have spent thelast you know chunk of your careerbuilding cloud services and and you knowrunning things in the sky I had thislike really memorable outage whereAmazon turned off Us East one dirtybecause the generators didn't come on ina hurricane and you know we were sort oflike 3 days into some God forsaken likesystem rebuild from backups ofeverybody's databases and my cooworkerturns to me and hegoes I'm fixing computers that don'texist in a data center I've never beento for people I've nevermet and he just had the like thousandyards stareing his eyes and I was likeyeah do you need some more coffeeyeah but and so you know like in a senseworking on this stuff is almost likePenance for me because I created allthese single points offailure anyway so let's recap a littlebit of all of this how do we live ourlives in this complicated world right socomplexity occurs when our systems haveinternalinteractions right complexity doesn'tmean oh there's a lot of stuff it's whenall that stuff starts to bump againsteach other and cause unpredictableoutcomes and complexity is also anatural consequence of system incentivesif you have a lot of people using athing and you're listening to what theyneed and you're you know like evolvingas you learn more you're going to end upwith somethingcomplex and better tools won't changethis right the complexity is aconsequence of who we are and thechoices we make sure you can you canburn through your budget faster but likeultimately where your project ends up onthe complexity scale is more about howmuch time and how many ideas areinvested into it than anythingelse so we can't beat complexity but wecan get beaten by it right and so youknow what are our coping strategies wellwe can start over we can eradicatedependencies we can cut scope do lessright we can simplify our architectureand a really big one is being consciousof and learning to kind of identify whenyou're getting into these likemultiplicator environmentsright like it once you start portingthings to multiple platforms and havingto build those like per platformabstractions how do you manage thatcomplexity back down how do you isolatecomplexity and a big part of success isisolatingcomplexity but I also want to you knowgive a shout out to gazing into theabyss and you know you can you can uh gogo for it right like Embrace complexityharness it yeah it's a deal with with anelder god and you may accomplish greatand terrible things but at a great andterrible price you know that's fine butyou when you do this you got to be realcareful right and and you want to bereally deliberate but deliberate abouthow and when you uh take on thatcomplexity so I guess in in closing wecan't solve complexity but we can buildbetter software uh or to put it in thethe words of cyclist Greg lemand itnever gets easier you just gofaster uh there and that's all",
    "summary": "Peter van Hardenberg's talk, \"Why Can't We Make Simple Software?\" explores the multifaceted nature of complexity in software development, arguing that it's not merely about difficulty or size, but rather the unpredictable interactions between systems. He uses illustrative examples like validating user input, scaling admin panels, and leaky abstractions to show how seemingly simple software can become complicated as edge cases, scale, and imperfect interfaces are introduced. He highlights the importance of well-written libraries and language type systems to reduce complexity by designing failures out of the system.\n\nThe talk argues against the notion that better tools alone can solve the complexity problem. Van Hardenberg introduces the concept of \"complexity homeostasis,\" suggesting that organizations and individuals have a tolerance for complexity, and that improvements in tools or environments often lead to increased complexity elsewhere. He references theories of software engineering from the 1970s and 80s and discusses essential vs. accidental complexity and also describes a paper that discusses how \"software architecture degrades with changes made to software\". He uses Jeff's paradox of better engines not reducing coal consumption because people did more work as an example of a parallel to how the complexity of a system is closely tied to its perceived utility and as such, its complexity is therefore closely tied to the utility that the system provides for users.\n\nUltimately, Van Hardenberg doesn't offer a solution to eliminate complexity, but rather suggests coping strategies. These include starting over, eradicating dependencies, cutting scope, simplifying architecture, and consciously managing environments that multiply complexity. He advocates for embracing complexity deliberately when its generative and surprising aspects can be harnessed, but warns against doing so without careful consideration. He also speaks on building \"local first\" software and illustrates this by citing a personal experience and an Amazon outage incident, emphasizing the value of agency and ownership in software. The takeaway is that while we can't \"solve\" complexity, we can make better choices to manage it and build better software despite it."

    "transcript": "the best programmers I know. I've met alot of developers in my life lately. Iasked myself, what does it take to beone of the best? What do they all havein common? I'm not gonna say it. I'm notgonna sayit. In uh the hope that this will be aninspiration to someone out there, Iwrote down traits I observed in the mostexceptional people in our craft. I wishI had that list when I was starting out.Uh had I followed this path, it wouldhave saved me a lot of time. Okay, sothis actually sounds like it could be apretty great thing. People are alwaysasking for kind of shortcuts. There's noshortcuts just so you know, buthopefully this thing gives you nice goodstuff. Read the reference. If there isone thing that I should have done as ayounger program, it would have been readthe reference of the thing I was using.I.e. read the Apache web serverdocumentation, the Python standardlibrary or the TOML spec. Don't go toStack Overflow. Don't ask LLM. Don'tguess. Just go straight to the source.Oftentimes it is surprising surprisinglyaccessible and well written. Ipersonally find that I like readingsource code. I like jumping todefinition and looking at the sourcecode because you can often discoverthings about how stuff works much muchmore clear than just reading theinterface and you get like a goodunderstanding. I've always liked that. Ido that a lot with go libraries. I'vegone through the gorilla like there wasan undocumented feature in gorilla whichis how do you ensure that someonedoesn't send you a web packet that istoo big that you don't want rightbecause theoretically if someone wantedto attack you on your websocket serverthey could just send a packet with an 8byt size. So they could be like, \"Ah,here you go. I'm going to send you up aaa gigawatt of memory and they can juststart sending you ones and zeros andthen like 10 of that could do that.\" Andthen you're just going to fill up yourspace and could bust your machine.Right? It's very very easy to take downsomebody with websockets if they haven'tput a maximum size on the header. Sowhere was it? I found a couple differentthings by just going through the sourceand being like, \"Ah, here's this. Here'sthis.\" And it took a while and thenlater on I found it in the actual likedocumentation uh and in some updatedfuture point. And I was just like hereyou go. I discovered this feature bylooking at code. It was very veryobvious. And then later on it was addedto documentation. It was fantastic. So Iwas like okay good. It was a good fe itwas a good feature and that wasfantastic and I only discovered it byreading source code. Great devsunderstand the technologies they use ona fundamental level. It's one thing tobe able to use a tool. It's a wholeother thing to truly gro understand it.A mere user will fumble around getconfused easily hold it wrong and notoptim let's see and not optimize theconfig. An expert goes in after readingthe reference and sits down to write aconfig for a tool or for the tool ofwhich they understand every single lineand can explain it to a colleague. Thatleaves no room for doubt. I mean to becompletely fair, even if you do trulyunderstand the tool and all that, Iwould still always have I always havedoubts no matter what because even as Iwrite it, there's just things thatthere's implications to the stuff youwrite that you may not understand.Grock, his favorite programmer. True.True. Yeah. To know a tool well, youhave to uh you have to know its history.Who created it? Why? to solve whichproblems. Interesting. Put it this way.When does that become not true? Do youalways have to understand the originalintentions to understand the project inthe current state? Let me give you acounter example. Linux was developed asa side project to see if it's possible.Just a little hobby. Wasn't going to goanywhere. You probably don't need toknow that. Git was invented because oneof the unnamed members or currentlyunnamed members or technically the nameis out there messed with Bitkeepersprotocol thus breaking the license. Thusthey couldn't do any more storage oftheir repository with Bitkeeper andLionus decided to bust out Git in a fewdays one year after Mean Girls came out.Just want you to remember that. Git'slike as old as Mean Girls. Crazy. Allright. Uh it's present. Who maintainsit? But where do they work on what?Interesting. This is also just aninteresting question. It is good to knowwho maintains it. Are they an activemaintainer? Are they un inactive? Wheredo they work? This could be interesting.This is a good question to ask yourself,which is what is the motivation for whythey're maintaining it? Is this a workrelated motivation? Are you going to beable to ask for things? Are you going tobe able to contribute to things? cuz inat least this was true at one point forme to be able to contribute to the flatbuffer buffers repository in 2016 I hadto sign like a Google I've I'mcommitting to your open source projectwaiver because of the company thateffectively backed flatbuffers. So thatwas a real thing, right? So there isthere is something to this that is veryvery true. You may have to end up if youthink an open source thing is reallygreat then you go to contribute to itand it turns out they don't allowcontributions from people who don't workat that company. Could be a good thingto know and on what its limitations whenthe tool is not a good fit when does itbreak. That's always a good answer. Uhits ecosystem what libraries exist whouses it what plugins. I mean, not alltools have libraries that need, youknow, I get what he's trying to say,though. Understand the dependencies andif it can be extended, how does itextend and why, like, and what are theextensions to it? All right. I mean,these are all good things to understandwith your tool. I I don't think you needto know all these things. It probablydepends on the horizon in which you'remaking decisions to know all thesethings, right? Do you need to know allthese things? If you're just doing apersonal project and you want and youwant to roll your own off, so you graban OOTH 2 library that just does thedoes some of the stuff for you and soyou're just like, I'm just going to domy own off flow. Like, do you need doyou need do you need to know all thatinformation? Probably not, right? Youprobably just literally Googled, grabbedthe first one, and called it a day.Context is probably pretty importanthere. If you're making that decision fora company, you might want to know alittle bit more about what you're doingbefore you do it. For example, if you'rea backend engineer and you make heavyuse of CFKA, I expect you to know a lotabout CFKA, not just things you read onReddit. At least that's what I expect ifyou want to become one of the bestengineers. Interesting. I'm not sure ifI agree with this statement at all.Like, I think if you use a tool enough,you should start reading its sourcecode. You should start trying tounderstand it if you if long as it'sopen source, right? You shouldunderstand it at a deeper level if youuse it a bunch. I think that that's agood takeaway. I don't know if you needto know who created CFKA to be a greatengineer. I just don't think that thatmatters. I don't think you even need toknow who maintains a project to be agreat engineer. I do think you need toknow its limitations. I do think it'sgood to understand its ecosystem, whocontribute, like how like how fast it'sbeing contributed to. I think thatthat's important. I don't know. It Itseems It seems a touch too specific. ItIt just feels a touch too specific here.Read the error message as in really readthe air message and try to understandwhat's written. Turns out if you justsit and meditate about the errormessage, it starts to speak to you. Thebest engineers can infer a ton ofinformation from very little context.Just by reading the air message, you canfix most of the problems you own. Italso feels like a superpower if you helpsomeone who doesn't have this that skilllike reading from a cup or so. I don'tunderstand reading from a cup. I onlyunderstand drinking from a cup. Oldinternet, anybody drinking from cups? Uhbut anyways, there's definitely a skillin reading errors, but there's also askill of having context in a project. IfI was given a completely new projectwith a completely new error, I might beable to infer a couple things and Icould probably do a decent job at it.But if I had context on the project,obviously even a little bit of thaterror would probably go much furtheraway. So, I'm not sure. I mean, I I doagree you should just always learn howto read error messages. Everything butCS C uh uh C++ template messages. Thenyou can just stop. Then you can justclose your eyes and hand it to an LLM.Please no. I don't want to look at this.Uh breakdown problems. Everyone getsstucks time. The best uh know how to getunstuck. They simplify problems untilthey become digestible. That's a hardskill to learn and requires a ton ofexperience. Alternatively, you just haveawesome problems solving skills. Eg.You're clever. If not, you can train it.But there is no way around breaking downhard problems. There is a problem inthis world that are too hard to solve atonce for anyone involved. Agreed. So, Ithere's this problem that we're doingwith our whole deck uh the the gamewe're making, which is just the deckinteractions. How do you make a UI feelgood while maintaining these statetransitions and animations? It'sactually was really really difficult.And so I've actually been breaking downthe problem. Yes. In a poor man'ssequence diagram inXcaliraw kind of going okay so how doesthis look? How do I walk through thisproblem? What does it look like? And nowI have a much better idea because I hadone way of doing things which is theoriginal way we thought about how tosolve this problem. and I realize that Icould do it a completely different wayby just simply putting this all outhere. I've already written the problemonce, attempted to solve it, didn't likehow it went. It doesn't feel good doingit, and it also like makes stuff notreally work. And so I I'm not a I amdefinitely not a believer that you candesign software all the time like this.This is a rarity. I know the problemspace. I've solved it once already, andnow I'm solving it again, but this timeI'm going to solve it in a better way.And so there is some things that justare better if you take the time to breakdown the problem. And this is a veryrare thing. I rarely do this. It has tobe a pretty complicated problem for itto work out normally. If you work as aprofessional developer, that is the bulkof the work you get paid to do. Breakingdown problems. If you do it right, itwill feel like cheating. If you let'ssee, if you just solve simple problemsuntil you're done. Also, I mean, it'skind of silly to say professionaldeveloper. If you work in software, yourentire job is taking big problem, makingbig problem, small problem, right? Likethat's all it is. That that's all ofsoftware. How do you make a game? Well,game's going to be separated intovarious things. Okay, I want to thinkabout deck. Well, how does deck work?Well, I need the interplay between gamestate and UI deck. Okay, let's zoom in.How do I do animations and timing? Okay,let's zoom in. Okay, so how are we goingto communicate in a way that can beserialized to JSON and rehydrated at anypoint so you know exactly where thestate is and it's reproducible? You justkeep on like dun dun dun dun. I'm goingto solve this one thing. I'm going tosolve the next thing. I'm going to solvethe next thing. Boom. It's done. How didI do the whole how did I do rendering? Irendered by simply going, okay, we havea very complicated menu. I'm going tobuild something that looks like the DOM.How does the DOM work? Okay, well it'slike a tree. How does rendering work?Okay, we're going to render down. Howdoes updating? And then just slowly justkept on building up this complicatedthing all the way until I had a layoutlibrary that had flex in it and hadcentering and had bounding andanimations. I didn't I didn't startthere. I ended there. All right. Don'tbe afraid to get your hands dirty. Thebest devs I know read a lot of code andthey are not afraid to touch it. Theynever say that is not for me or I can'thelp you there or I can't help you here.Instead, they just start and learn. Codeis just code. They can just pick up anyskill that is required with time andeffort. I I do like that. This is a goodstatement right here. You can pick upanything with just time and effort.Honestly, I cannot tell you how manypeople I've met in my life as adeveloper that ask for permission to dostuff. They're the same people who thinkpeople on the internets who say you mustgo to college to learn are like, \"Well,I guess I can't learn.\" It's just like,\"Brother, why are you being gaykept?You'regatekeep.\" Shut up. Just start doingstuff. Stop listening to every lastthing you hear as like the end. Youdon't need to ask for permission all thetime. You can just pick up a skill andyou can just learn it. Like, that's justallowed. uh before you know it, theybecome the go-to person in the team forwhatever they touched. Mostly becausethey were the only ones who were notafraid to touch it in the first place. II've told the story quite a few timesabout Groovy and like my initial successat Netflix all came from that which isthat nobody wanted to touch Groovy. Noone wanted to do the kind of the middleend of the Netflix UI. And so what did Ivolunteer for? Obviously I volunteeredfor that. Nobody would do it. So you doit cuz it's not hard. You're like I cansol I can solve her. I can solve her. Uhalways help uh always help others. On arelated point, great engineers are inhigh demand and are always busy, butthey always try to help. That's becausethey are a naturally curious and theirsupportive mind. Let's see. Hold on.Great engineers are in high demand andare always busy, but they always try tohelp. That's because they are naturallycurious and their supportive mind iswhat made them great engineers in thefirst place. I don't know if that'strue. Like would you call Lionus ahighly supported supportive engineer? Ithink that's arguable. Would you callhim a great engineer? Absolutely. Idon't think you can always say thedesire to help somebody else is a markof a great engineer. He supports veryaggressively. You have to consider whomhe deals with. Some of the smartestpeople in the universe and Rustdevelopers.Um I somebody's going to get I'm goingto get an email on that one. someone'sgoing to be like, \"Hey, don't make funof furries again. That was very rude.\"So, I mean, I think there's there'sdefinitely a point to this, which is forme, this is actually a better way to belike, \"Hey, how do you be verysuccessful in a corporate environment?You attempt to be the most helpfulperson.\" That's more of how I read this.And also, it's just kind of good policynot to be an You know, thiskind of this is more of like a personalnote. I try not to deal with people asan Now, as an internet person,I receive somewhere between 1 to 15 hatemessages a day. You know what I do? Mutethem. That's all you do. You just youjust mute them and just just don't evencare. Most awesome engineers are wellspoken and happy to share knowledge.One, the best have some outlet for theirthoughts. Blogs, talks, open source, ora combination of those. I actually fullydisagree with this. Just just FYI, Idon't think you have to do any of theseto be a great engineer. In fact, I kindof think this is like a Twitter Twittermind virus that has gone out there. Thisis kind of like a corporate mind virusfrom like 2015 2014 when React came outand they had the big conference talk andthen everyone started really gettinggeared up about conferences. Then itbecame this thing where it's like yougot to do conference talk. Now I thinkpublic speaking is good for your souland you should do it. You should dopublic speaking not because it makes yougreat, but because it puts you into anuncomfortable situation in which youlearn that it's really not that bad. Theend. It's like that simple. Very, verydifferent motivation. I think it's goodfor you to do this. I think it's goodfor you to learn how to write becauseit's good to think through your thoughtsand understand how to communicate them.Very different. Okay. I don't think youhave to do any of this though. None ofit to be a great engineer. Though thereare benefits of doing it. That's all I'msaying. Okay. Do you understand? Uh, youcan write for yourself. Exactly. I thinkthere's a strong correlation betweenwriting skills and programming. I thinkthere's actually zero because I haveshitty writing skills and I'd like tothink that I'm an above averageprogrammer. That's it. I think I'm aboveaverage. Uh, all the best engineers Iknow have good command over at least onehuman language. More often, let's see,often more. I actually have on LinkedInEnglish as barely proficient and primarylanguage as JavaScript cuz I thought itwas funny. And now looking back thatmight have pre prevented jobopportunities, but who knows? Masteringthe way you write is mastering the wayyou think and vice versa. I'm curiousabout that. I'm not sure if that's true.Again, I I think this is kind of a I Ithink there is something very good aboutlearning to communicate and communicatein the median you wish to very verywell. I do not think that there's somesort of strong correlation betweenwriting and programming. I think they'revery different skills and they exercisevery different ways of thinking. Justlike I think talking, like what I'mdoing right now, I think I'm decent atit. I think I can kind of hold a thoughtand have a good enough context windowand kind of navigate through all thethings and come back to some sort ofpoint some of the times, but I don'tthink that has anything to do with myprogramming skills like at all. Likemaybe maybe one could argue that I havea long contextwindow. I don't know what happens in thebrain, okay? Things just start theyjust, you know, and then I growl at itbecause I'm like long context windowstatistically on average, huh, guy? Youknow what I'm talking about, baby? Andmaybe that's also the reason why I'mgood at programming. But those aren'tnecessarily related. They're more likeincidences of something that makes meunique in the way that I'm unique. Ormaybe it's not unique at all. and theneverybody has it and I'm just stupid. Ihave no idea. I try not to be tooprescriptive about these things. I thinkit's better to be descriptive about themin the sense that if you can communicatewell while writing, you probably have agood ability to formulate logicalthoughts. The end. But that's not theonly way, right? It's more likedescriptive. If you're good at if you'regood at thinking thoughts, you'reprobably you probably have thoughts thatare well thought. Okay, cool. High five.Excellent programmers find joy inplaying with words. I don't think that'strue at all. I don't like playing withwords. I want nothing. Okay, I amassuming that I am an excellentprogrammer in this thing. I actuallyOkay, real talk. Sniffing my own farts,drinking my own Kool-Aid, whatever youcall the phrase. I think I'm pretty danggood at programming. Nonetheless, I hateI hate words. Okay, self glaze. What the dude? I'm doing it. Okay, I'mdoing it because I don't you know, I onetime worked with a co-orker that was thebest programmer I've ever seen in mylifetime and he did not write a lot ofthings down ever. He I would notcategorize him under the great writersituation, but he was so good atprogramming. Never stopped learning. I'malready I can already tell I'm going tolove this one. Some of the best devs Iknow are 60 plus years old. They can runcircles around me. Part of the reason isthat they keep learning. If there is anew tool they haven't tried or alanguage they like, they will learn it.This way, they always stay on top ofthings without much effort. You know, II think Uncle Bob's a good example ofthis in some sense. I'm not saying Ipraise him in all of, you know, me andhim and clean architecture, we don'tnecessarily get along on that one. I'mnot a huge fan of that kind of stuff.But nonetheless, he also went off andside quested on closure and loves lispdialects. I think there's something kindof cool about that. Like, hey, I'm Javaman. I do Java stuff. We do designpatterns. I'm also going to use acompletely untyped language and acompletely different style that's purelyfunctional because I'm going to goinvestigate that. I think that's prettycool. Like, that's a good like I thinkthat's a good mentality to have. Uh thatis not to be taken for granted. Uh a lotof people stop learning really quicklyafter they graduate from university orstart their first job. Agreed. I thinksome people there's like thisdestination in their head which is whenI am done with university I then becomeprofessional developer and I have tolearn to be ready and then once I'm doneI'm ready now I just program. It's justlike no, you know, you should really tryto think of things in a more holisticsense, which is why even have a job thatis multiplied by learning if you're notwilling to learn. Like this is one ofthe greatest aspects to being aprogrammer is that every day you get achance to learn something. You get a youget a chance to try to multiply yourskills. That is not the common when itcomes to jobs. Most people's jobs do notget that. They get stuck thinking thatwhat they got taught in school is theright way to do things. I mean, I'vedone that. Of course, everybody doesthat until you get until you learn thatyou're wrong. Dude, I was a designpatternAndy. Everything new is bad and notworth their time. So, there I meantotally not wrong though. Also, okay,Big Sky uh software, right? Big SkySoftware.We find the hot new trends in theindustry and then build the opposite ofthat. Now this, myfriends, now that'ssoftware. Okay, by the way, that's HTMX.So there are 25 year olds who arementally retired and 68 year olds whoare still fresh in their mind. I try toone day belong to the latter group.There's also kind of like an inverseproblem here, which is if this is thebad thing, the good thing would beeverything new is good and worth yourtime, right? Like if I were to invertthat sentence, that would make it thatwould fall into the good category. And Idon't I don't know if I believe thateither, right? Like I don't think Ibelieve that statement either. I don'tthink new things are good either. Ithink the proper mentality to have as aprogrammer is everything is horshit.It's all inconvenient. And either youdeal with the things given to you or youwrite it yourself. and you deal withthat and that's it. Uh somewhat related,the best engineers don't follow trends,but they will always carefully evaluatethe benefits of new technology. If theydismiss it, they can tell you exactlywhy when the tech technology would be agood choice and what alternatives are.Yeah, it's very easy for me. Like all Ihave to do is look at it and go, is thatTypescript? It's likethat. Easy, easy. Uh the best devs talkto principal engineers and juniorsalike. There are there is no hierarchy.They try to learn from everyone, youngand old. The newcomers are often aren'tentrenched in office politics yet andstill have a fresh mind. They don't knowwhy things are hard and so the purposeor so they propose creative solutions.Maybe the obstacles from the past are nomore which makes these people a greatsource of inspiration. So I'm going togive kind of like a interesting examplehere. People do this constantly andstatus does matter. I know contrariantaking right now. I will throw one thingout for you. If you are exceptionallybusy, you have a deadline that's aboutto hit. Let's just say you work at acompany calledSchmetflix and you're walking from thebathroom to your desk and brand new hirecomes in and goes, \"Hey man, could Ijust pick your brain for like 20 minuteson something?\" you'd say, \"Hey, I wouldlove to, but I need to do somethingright now and I need you to just put iton my calendar for say tomorrow orsomewhere in the future.\" Okay, totallyreasonable, right? Let's say that ShmeedSchmeings, CEO of Netflix, Schm Netflix,sorry, comes up to you and says, \"Heyman, I'd like to pick your brain for 20minutes. Can you sit down right now? Areyou going to go tell Mr. meetschmastings to go schedule 20 minutes onyour calendar or are you going to belike I got 20 minutes for you baby. Thereality is is that often people letstatus matter and you know what it'sprobably sometimes a good thing. Justthrowing it out there. I understand whathe's trying to say which is that tosolve problems purely it's nice to beable to treat anyone uniquely becausethey have their own context and allthat. But I am going to tell you that anintern suggesting that we rewriteeverything with a new build systemversus the principal engineer saying,\"Hey, let's not do that.\" I'm going togive somebody probably a higher ratingthan the other one. I will still hearout both, but one status does in factmatter more than the other. There's agood reason why status matters, or elseit would be just pure chaos if everybodyhad equal votes. There is a prioritylevel. There is a hierarchy. And that isokay. That's kind of what you expect.You hope a company that is good wouldput the people that are good at makingdecisions higher up. Now, that's notalways the case. We can all understandthat's not the case. Yeah, that's justhow it works. I listen to titles morethan I should. Yeah. And and sometimesit's good to listen to titles andsometimes it's bad to listen to titles,but I still think they matter and youshould know when when to do that. Builda reputation. See what if status doesn'tmatter, then why you build a reputation?Uh you can be a solid engineer if you dogood work but you can be let's see butyou can only be one of the best ifyou're known for your good work at leastwithin a larger group organization.Yeah, there is something to this whichis super unfortunate. There's plenty ofgreat engineers that get just shaftedbecause they just do good engineeringand that's that. That's where like agood manager really comes into play andcan be very very helpful. If you havepeople fighting for you and you don'thave to worry about it, that is ahealthy organization. There are manyways to build a reputation for yourself.You've built and shipped criticalservice for a larger org. You wrote afamous tool. I mean, think about theguy, think about the guy who wrote Brewand then was rejected by Google becausehe couldn't invert a binary tree. Youcontribute to a popular open sourcetool. True and also not true. You wrotea book that is often mentioned. Hedidn't even once say that you say stupidthings on Twitch and make YouTubevideos. Like, what the hell? What thehell is this article about? Huh? Like,why aren't you mentioninglike other forms of ofmedia? Who wants to write a book? Why doyou think it is important to be knownfor your work? All of the above are waysto extend your radius of impact in thecommunity. Famous developers impact waymore than non-famous developers. Yeah,that's not necessarily a good thing,though. I don't think you have to haveimpact. I don't think that should evenbe your goal, right? I just don't thinkthat that like I don't know if thisshould be a goal. The reality is thatsome there are people that are famous onthe internets that do dumb things. I'mnot saying I'm not like mentioning anynames. I have a friend, you know, youknow, like does that mean does that meanyou should listen to all the things youhear on the internet just becausesomebody has a lot of followers? Likethat's not necessarily a good way tofilter your ideas. Yeah, it was Tee, bythe way, if you're wondering. I'mreferring to TJ. There's only so muchcode you can write if you want to scaleyour impact. You have to become athought leader. I don't think you haveto. I don't think you have to. I I thinkthat you have to value what it means toto to scale your impact and what is yourgoal, right? I I just don't I don'tthink you have to. This is just one wayto do things. And you know, it's notalways great to be a quote unquotethought leader. You also have tounderstand that the moment you have anopinion and like more than a hundredpeople like your opinion, people arealso going to call you a Nazi. And youhave to deal with that as well. You'regoing to have to deal with people whohate you at your job because that's justa part of life. You're going to have todeal with people who will actively goagainst you because that's just a partof your a part of being a quote unquotethought leader. So it's not this is nota free tradeoff that is being made. It'snot like, hey, guess what? I'm now athought leader. Everything's great. It'slike it may not be that great.Everything you do gets thrown under amicroscope. If you lose your crap, youknow what's one thing that's reallygreat about being an anonymous person?For the most part, you can lose your every now and then and nobodycares. Now, you may be the unlucky Karenwho loses their and gets videotapedand then it goes viral on TikTok andthen you get fired from your job. Like,that does happen, but a lot of peoplelose their every day and nobodycares. And that's like a cool privilegeto have. You think I could just have ameltdown in public? A I would berad. Uh, building a reputation is along-term goal. It doesn't happenovernight, nor does it have to. Uh, andwon't happen by accident. If you show upevery day and do the work over time, thework will speak for itself, more peoplewill trust you and your work and theywill want uh to work with you. You knowwhat the funny part is is that peoplewill accuse you that you're even if youdo stuff, you will get accused that yourreputation is built because you're aNepo baby, that you got some sort of yougot handed some sort of success. Even ifyou do all the work, you'll still getyou'll still get just completely rakedall the time. I'm not sure if this is agreat this is not necessarily a greatsuggestion, okay? uh more uh more peoplewill trust you and your work and theywill want to work with you. You willwork on more prestigious projects andyour circle will grow. I once heardabout this idea that your latest workshould overshadow everything you didbefore. That's a good sign that you areon the right track. Maybe that kind ofreminds me of the old um don't be thesmartest person in the room. What iswhat is the problem with that phrase?Can anyone tell me the problem with thatphrase? Here I'll make it simple foryou. Let's pretend we have a room. Okay.And inside this room, we have put somepeople in here. Yay. They're in here.They're chatting. Everything'sgreat. I always have to be carefuldrawing stick figures because sometimesI overextend things and then I get adong. Uh-oh. This guy's the smartestperson in the room. He doesn't want tobe the smartest person in the room. So,what does he do? He leaves. Well, now weonly have two people left. Well,unfortunately, Bill also doesn't want tobe the smartest person in the room. So,what does he do? He leaves.Well, then what happens next? Well, thenthis person's the only person left inthe room and by by mathematicalstandards is the smartest person in theroom, also thedumbest. So, heleaves. If people don't want to be thesmartest person in the room, in the end,every room will be empty. You justexplained recursion to me. I justexplained recursion. I also explained astupid principle. You're assuming thatpeople know that they are the smartest.True. But if that's your goal, that'swhat's going to happen. Uh gametheoretica view of the room. It's true.It's true. I am I am doing some gametheorizing. It's just like I don't likethose kind of phrases. And I I thinkthis phrase probably falls underneathit. You know, the most junior of tasksare often required to be completed bythe most senior people because there issomething special about somebody who hashoned their skills over 20 years wherethey can put up with things and solvethings that would otherwise be viewed asarduous and likely go off track bysomeone who's more junior. So, doesevery single project have to overshadowthe next thing you do? I don't think itdoes. The only quote I you can follow100% of the time is never eat yellowsnow.True. Absolutely. A fact of life. Havepatience. Oo, I like this one. I'mliking where this is going. Uh, you needpatience with computers and humans,especially uh with uh with yourself. Noteverything will work right away andpeople have to take time to learn. It'snot that people around you are stupid.They just have incomplete information.Some are stupid. Uh you might be the onethat's stupid. Just remember, half thepeople you meet are might just be on theother half, the back nine of theintelligence curve. and you might be onthat back nine as well. Withoutpatience, it will feel like the world isagainst you and everyone around you isjust incompetent. That's a miserableplace to be. You're too clever for yourown good. To be one of the best, youneed an incredible amount of patience,focus, and dedication. You can't affordto get distracted easily. If you want tosolve hard problems, you have to rereturn to the keyboard to get over it.You have to put in the work to push aproject over the finish line. And if youcan do so while not being an arrogantprick, that's even better. That's whatseparates the best from the rest. Imean, delivering projects is hard. Ithink we can all agree that developersfavorite pastime is creating a projectthat they'll abandon later on. What hesaid right here is so good. Pushing aproject over the finish line is reallyreally hard to do. Like how do you howdo you define done and how do you get itinto a place that is actually done?Never blame the computer. Mostdevelopers blame the software, otherpeople, their dog or the weather forflaky, seemingly random bugs. The bestdevs don't. No matter how erratic ormischievous the behavior of a computerseems, there is always a logicalexplanation. You just haven't found ityet. The best keep digging until theyfind the reason. They might not find areason immediately. They might not everfind it, but they never blame theexternal circumstances. With thisattitude, they are able to makeincredible progress and learn thingsthat other others fail too. When youmistake bugs for incomprehensible magic,magic is what it will always be. Yeah,of course. I mean, that'd be stupid tothink that there's magic to it at all.It's never a magic. It's almost always arace condition of some sort. But ifwe're going to be real here, I wouldlike to add one thing to this. I thinkto be the best dev, whenever there's aproblem or a bug in the software thatyou are somewhat involved in, I thinkyou should think it is your problem andthen start from that position. I wouldsay that that makes you a very goodteammate and someone to work with. Whensomething goes wrong, I typically likeif a thing breaks in our game, I makethe assumption it's me always, even ifit's not something I've been working onbecause that way I'm quick to help out.I'm quick to try to uh find like I'mquick to try to diagnose and when Irealize it's not me, then I get to makefun of TJ or inversely it is me and TJgets to make fun of me. Like it's a funtime. Like that's a good way to work,right? That's like a great way to workis that you just always acceptresponsibility and then when you findout it's not, you get to have fun andjab at the person that you know andlike. Uh don't be afraid to say I don'tknow. Oh, I say this probably too oftenin job interviews. I push candidateshard to say at least I don't know once.I don't think I need to do that. Uh thereason was not that I wanted to looksuperior. Although some people certainlyhad that impression. Yeah, that'sbecause you're I mean not hard to figureout why that's happening when you dolike that should not be a goal. yourgoal. I mean truly a goal of aninterview is to find out how much aperson knows by letting them tell astory. That is one great way to measurea good software engineering interview.It's not the only way. It is one way. Ilike to hear someone just talk and talkand talk and talk about what they'vedone. I want to hear someonepassionately explain to me why theybuilt their own HTTP server. Why? Idon't care why they do it. I don't thinkit's probably even useful at the job. Ijust want to hear that they didsomething and that they did somethingand kept going and going and going,right? No, I wanted to reach theboundary of their knowledge. I wanted tostand with them on the edge of what theythought they knew. There's alsosomething in here that's I mean, I don'tthink whoever is writing this is meaningto come across this way. But when youthink you can take somebody to thatpoint, you also make the assumption thatyou know more about software than theydo. somewhere fundamentally inside ofit, you are making the assumption thatyou know enough to get a person to thatpoint. Now, perhaps you can just keepasking questions and maybe there's a wayto do that and it just works out. Ithink there's something about that thatmay or may not be true. All right. Uhoften I myself didn't know the answer.And to be honest, I didn't care aboutthe answer. What I cared about was whatwhen people bullshitted their waythrough an interview. If you don't knowthe answer, how do you know they'rebullshitting? Sometimes like if have youever met a good bullshitter? I mean, Igot through my Netflix interview. One ofmy interviews was uh like a reallyintense RxJS question and I justhappened to start looking at RxJS andsaid something about it and that's why Igot the interview I believe. And due tothat, I got this really hard question.What did I do? Well, I bullshitted myway. Okay, I went hard on theand I started glazing myinterviewer really, really hard and hejust kept telling me answers because wewere co-t talking about it. You knowwhat I like ah yeah dude that's what I'msaying select many wow yeah you know Imean it's crazy can you like theinterface it escapes me for a second nowdoes it take anobservable when you return is the returnvalue an observable or a list of them Ican'tyou know just keep on dude just keep onjust w glazing keep on moving forwarddude it's so good and it worked out thebest candidates say huh I don't know butthat's an interesting question. If I hadto guess, I would say and then theywould proceed to deduce the answer.That's a sign that you have a potentialto be a greatengineer perhaps. I mean, I think it'sgood to say I don't know. I think thereis something very good about saying Idon't know. People feel like theyshouldn't say that because it makes themlook dumb. It does. But that's okay.You're dumb in a specific category.That's okay to be ignorant, right? It'sokay. You should be ignorant in somecategories. If you're afraid to say, \"Idon't know.\" You come from a position ofhubris or defensiveness. I don't likebullshitters on my team. Better toacknowledge that you can't knoweverything. Once you accept that, youallow yourself to learn. The importantthing is that you don't stop askingquestions, said Albert Einstein. I lovethe premise. I don't like how he gets itout. I think this might this might justto me this feels like I wouldn't likethat interview either. Right. Don'tguess in the face of ambiguity. Refusethe temptation to guess. That is one ofmy favorite rules of the Pep 20, theZenapy. Yeah, I guess all the time.Yeah, I'm going to go with the opposite.In fact, that's how you build a goodproduct is you guess. Uh, and they're sotempting to guess. I've been there manytimes and I failed with my own ambition.When you guess, two things can happen.The best case, you're wrong and yourincorrect assumptions lead to a bug. Andworst case, you are right. And you'llnever stop uh and second guess yourself.You build up your mental model based onthe wrong assumptions. This can hauntyou for a long time. Okay, this must beabout specific software and fixing abug. is my assumption is I'm not evensure what he means by that because ofteneven when I'm fixing bugs I still guesslike I get the information in and gookay here are the things that are movingmy best guess for what's happening isthat this part's not receiving an updatelet's go prove it right so I mean Ithink all good debugging starts with agood or uh starts with a good educatedguess I'm not sure yeah so I'm not sureI'm not I I I don't really understand Iguess what the principle is he's tryingto say here I think there's somethinghere that probably missing. My guess isthat I'm not reading this correctly andthere's something that's like, okay,don't guess and then move on and thendon't ever check. But if you but youhave to run it once, right? Like, canyou ever just guess and be wrong andjust lead to a bug? I don't know.Anyways, again, resist the urge toguess, ask questions, read thereference, use a debugger, be thorough,do what it takes to get the answer.Okay, true, true. Keep it simple. Cleverengineers write clever code. Exceptionalengineers write simple code.Clever problems sometimes require cleversolutions. Simple problems sometimesrequire clever solutions. Complexproblems sometimes require simplesolutions. Simple solutions sometimesrequire simple or simple problemssometimes require simple solutions. Noteverything can be I I just don't believethat this exists. I don't think there issome rule that's like only goodengineers write simple code. I don'tknow. Sometimes sometimes things arejust very very hard, right? Like haveyou ever done a bunch of tree walks?Sometimes they're just hard, you know,like sometimes when you do a bunch oftree walks, it's just hard. That's justthe way it goes. And that's it. It'sjust hard. It's just complex tounderstand the problem is really, reallyhard. Like here, here's a good example.Uh, one of the open source projects thatI maintained for quite some timerequired the effectively the complementof two separate trees or not thecomplement, the the um the difference.Uh, effectively you had two differenttrees that were generated, right? Andyou had to create the tree. That's theuh effectively the or or it would be thecompliment. It's whatever this is. Whatwhat is this thing, right? This side. Iwant that side. That's the compliment,right? That's the compliment. You haveto calculate the complement of twotrees. That's an ass. Your asses areweird that your cheeks overlap with eachother in time and space. Okay, that'snot an ass. Okay, that's somethingcompletely different. Why are yourcheeks intersecting each other? Right?So you had to do this with two differenttrees, but the trees were specified asarrays with things like 0 to 10. Likeyou can imagine why this is a very hardproblem. There's not a simple solutionto this other than deeply understandingthe deeply understanding the problem andbeing able to create and be able to uhgrab out this thing right here. Likethere's just no there's just no simplesolution, right? All right. Anyways,final thoughts. The above is not achecklist or a competition. The greatengineer is not a race. Don't trickyourself into thinking you can skip thehard work. There is no shortcut. Goodluck with your journey. Love the ending.Let's go. That's a good ending. That isa good ending. Good ending. Good ending.Love it. I absolutely love that endingbecause it's true. There is no shortcut.There is nothing. No list iscomprehensive. Everything is going to beunique in its own situation. Just workhard. And as I've said a few times in mylife, work hard, get smart. Okay? Don'twork smart. not hard or whatever thestupid phrase is. Get work hard, getsmart.",
    "summary": "The video \"The Best Programmers I Know - Prime Reacts\" features Prime reacting to a list of traits observed in exceptional programmers. The core message is that becoming a top-tier developer isn't about shortcuts or adhering to a checklist, but rather about a deep commitment to learning, understanding, and problem-solving. Key traits highlighted include diligently reading documentation and source code to gain a fundamental understanding of technologies, rather than relying on quick fixes from Stack Overflow or LLMs. The best programmers also break down complex problems into digestible pieces, aren't afraid to get their hands dirty by diving into code, and consistently help others.\n\nPrime agrees with many points but offers counterarguments and nuances. He argues against the idea that great engineers *must* always be outwardly helpful or build a public reputation through blogging or conferences, suggesting these are not essential for technical excellence, though beneficial for other reasons (e.g., public speaking builds character). He also disputes the idea that mastering a human language is directly correlated with programming skills. Prime emphasizes the importance of patience, not blaming external factors for bugs, and being willing to admit \"I don't know,\" viewing these as essential for continuous learning. He critiques the idea that guessing has no place in debugging, stating that educated guessing is a valuable tool.\n\nUltimately, Prime endorses the original list's final thought: there's no substitute for hard work and continuous learning. He encourages viewers to \"work hard, get smart,\" rather than seeking shortcuts. The value lies in the comprehensive overview of valuable programming characteristics that, whilst perhaps not all essential, add tremendous value to any programmer looking to improve."

    "transcript": "thank you well as he said my recentobsession is llms andum today I want to talk about what thatmight mean for all of us going for forso this is one of those things that ischanging so fast that the things that Isay today will probablysound naive in a year at DDD Europe2025 and uh maybe even much sooner sothis is a talk fortoday you know may of2024and a lot of what I'm saying thereforeis very provisional much morespeculative than what I like to usuallytalk about also based on things that Idon't understand very well right I havebeen doing a lot of dabbling with largelanguage models but I don't have deepunderstanding and I don't have deepexperience as most people don't at thispointuh so um just to spell out the acronymsuh lolm stands for large language modelit does seem nice to me that whensomething that I would really call AIfinally comes along that it has two ofour favorite words in it it didn't haveto be that way there have been manyattempts at AI over the years thatproduced various things of varyinglevels of usefulness but uh this oneseems different to me when I thinkabout this one it feels like the late90s and the web arriving those of youwho can remember those days it was atfirst maybe not such a big thing it wasfun to have websites about this and thatbut um it seemed like enterprisesoftware would probably go on on its ownpath we had alreadyum networking and and integrationsystems that were much more capable thanuh HTTP of the time and yet here we areright uh the web is everything and um itfeels that way to me this time again itfeels like too in the pace the way itjust goes faster and faster so we'llsee now I don't think we know what'sgoing to happen and that's important torecognize uh but we don't have to knowwhat's going to happen in order to getready somewhat so to illustrate thispoint let's take a few common scenariosso one scenario is the end of the worldso perhaps there will beyou know the AI will turn on us and justkill us all or maybe they will use us asbatteries or you know one of the popularscenarios that came along a decade or soago was that someone will optimizesomething you know like a toasterfactory with a slightly too smart AIThat's entire focus is on maximizingtoasteroutput to do so it takes over the worldand turn everything into a toasterFactory and so what is the planningimplication of thisscenario basically whatever we do thesame thing will happen if you study llmsif you try lots of experiments with thenew AIS or if youdon't the same things will happen or youknow we could get superhumanAGI so what will happen if you studyllms or if you don't and basically we'llall lose our jobs and I guess we'll alllive on the basic income that Sam mmandishes out to the people that helikes but whatever it is it won't dependon how much you study llms right now sothen there's the scenario where thiskind of Fizzles out this is a scenariowhere um you knowfor all its apparent promise llms don'tdo much more than they donow and that seems possible I would saythat even in that scenario it's at thispoint implausible that lmms will nothave a pretty big impact because I thinkwith the tools we have right now wecould already do amazing things that'smy opinion but still this is not thescenario I am really preparing for andif you stand back in this scenario youcome out fine uh there's lots ofenterprise software going on or whateverkind of software youdo you have the very gratifyingopportunity to say I Told You So to theenthusiasts likeme uh whereas I'll have to endure alittle bit ofembarrassment but I think I'll have hadmore fun thanyou and that matters toonow uh even in that scenario there willbe little projects here and there maybebig projects here and there using thetools for specific things that it's goodat and I think I'll steer myself towardone ofthose and then there's the one that Iactually think is the most likely and orperhaps I just think it's the one I hopefor and that is that we're going to havea software Revolution that softwaredevelopment 10 years now is going to bequite different than it is now but we'llstill need humans in the process so notthe Superhuman AGIscenario in this case it really doesmatter whether you study this now or notyou will end up at the Forefront of thenext wave and um youknow you may well be able to catch upit'll be easier to learn the things in afew years than it is now so it's notlike you only get one chance to get onthe train and then it leaves the stationbut there are advantages to getting onearly so by the way before I go on Iwill point out that I'm focusing on theimpact on people like us and we I thinkare well positioned for a lot of thesescenarios a lot of people aren't and Ithink this is likely to be verydisruptive to the labor market and otherthings in a way that is going to causesome uh suffering for some people so yeswe should be aware of that but that'snot what I'm talking about but I hopethat we willsomehow um you know have an kind ofEquitable outcome in this wholethinganyway so in either of those last twoscenarios it seems seems to me thatsoftware development is going to changea lot maybe in ways thatmight uh make the kind of work that youdo right nowoldfashioned or another way to frame itis there are exciting new things that wecan do that we couldn't do before that'sreally something that uh reinvigoratesme after doing this for a long time asmuch as I love it it starts to feelrepetitiveand now there's something different todo and you know if you are one of thepeople who hasn't looked into it muchand you may say you know I've seen chatGPT and few of these other things Idon't think that gives much sense of thescope of applications that this is goingto have the um the applications we'veseen so far probably just aglimpse just like looking at theworldwide web of1996 or S would not really give you muchof an idea of what the web of2010 would belike that's not really very long timeright so basically I am getting readyfor you know a world in which softwaredevelopment is very different and itwill change whether you like it or notwhether you study it ornot but uh you will have a lot morefun if you studyitso I also hope that I can persuade morepeople to do it or to be doing it inkind of the context of this communitybecause I don't want to uh I want tohave that Communityalong I think it's a good community inmany ways not leastin the sort of I don't know moralbackbonethat is a bit stronger than it is insome of the other areas of the thankyou andso the world might be better if we haveall these thousands of peopleinvolved okay so getting on toit there are various reasons then to goahead and learn the tools that we wehave and one is that most likely it'sgood preparation for the things that wewill have 5 years from now or 10 yearsfrom now most likely that's the way itusuallygoes and in any case these are usefultools you can do a lot withthem and finally because they are funthey are the most fun thing that I haveencountered for I don't know 15 yearsit'sa good heuristic I think it's somethingseems really fun your brain is tellingyou that there's something theresomethingvaluable maybe some of you remember afew years ago when I was all excitedabout ummicroservices and uh I mean I wasn't asexcited about it as I am about this butI was excited because finally we hadsome boundaries you know to expressexplicitly something some of the thingsthat had been implicit in past systemsthat hadn't worked out too well and Isaid you know I know I'm kind of jumpingon a bandwagon here but I had looked upbandwagon just wondering well why do wesay jumping on the bandwagon anyway whatdoes that actually mean it turns outthat in the 19th century they had thesethings calledbandwagons and I guess people jumped onthem and uh anyway I think doesn't thatsound like fun I would rather be theperson jumping on the bandwagon and thenthe person saying you're just jumping onabandwagonso in the spirit of this I thought wellI'll use an AI tool to create a pictureand I told her make me a picture of abandwagon where humans and AIS aremaking musictogether oh and then it createdthis thisdystopian view of a outcome My Hope doesnot happen where the robots are makingmusic in a kind of soulless way andthe beating down humans around the edgesI guess are clearly not enjoying it Idon't I don't know this is not thefuture Iwant no more air for thispresentation all right so I I am talkingto DDD Europe because I think DD isrelevant to this I don't uh come to thatkind of conclusionlightly because obviously DDD is kind ofimportant to me but I have this kind ofchecklist you know you could call it theDDD new thingchecklist and you could say does DDDhelp us do this new thing right or doesthe new thing help us doDDD ordoes the thing help us with the goals ofDDD even if we would have to change whatwe do quite a bit and in this third onemaybe the other two but the thirdone I think is pretty clear the wholepoint of an llm is that a complexdomain is being you know crunched into aform that allows you to operate on thatcomplexity in an interesting wayand remember that the subtitle of mybook was tackling complexity in theheart ofsoftware that's what it's really aboutright in fact that was the originalworking title of thebook um butum so in DDD we craft domain models wedo this as humans making models whichare conceptual systems and a language togo with thosemodels now uh if we're doing this withllms we're training this neural networkin some way usingexamples and um of course it's beingtrained to operate on that domain howdeep is this parallel well time willtell enough of that General St stuff Iwant to talk about I've talked about howI think you should dive in I think youshould learn some things about this howmany of you have used anllm okay I'll call thateveryone how many people have uh saywritten prompts you know that are kindof programmatic prompts tried to make itdo something other than justchat okay I'll call thathalf and how how manyhave called uh have U made a API multi-promptthing okay I'll call that 20%15 how many people have fine-tuned inLM okay so that's a smaller number butnot zero I'm glad so I'll talk about allthose things I better talk a littlefaster so the first thing that I did andremember this this is my LearningJourney I'm not speaking to you as anexpert right I'm speaking to you as aperson that might be six months ahead ofyou in thisthing nine months ahead of you dependingon where you arewhatever the first thing everyone startswith is promptingso I was working with this game designerReed berwitz and yes it's important towork with domain experts right that's aDDD principle that isn't likely tochangechange and um so in computer games asmost of you would know there arecharacters and you have littleconversations sometimes and theseconversations are very mechanicalthey're all they give you three optionsin a menu you choose one it's aprescriptedresponse could anllm create a more you know fluidinteraction with a character where youcould really say what you wanted to andthe character would respond accordinglyso we decided to try you knowexperimenting in that space there's anaive approach after all chat GPT doescarry on a kind of conversation with youand perhaps all you have to do is justkind of tell it what character it'splaying and you could just uh basicallyleverage that Reed said this will notwork I'll call this the naive approachlet's doit how else are we to know why why isthis a bad idea but it is but whyso let's make a simple game we promptthe this is going to be chat GPT in thisparticular case these are actual promptsI put into the actual chat TBT and itsactual non Sherry picked response so Isay something like you know you are apirate who's caught someone sneakingonto your Treasure Islandand you you're going to kill them butthey say they have something valuablethat you'll want So you you're listeningright so you say to the captive and nowchat GPT responds right and it saysyou've got exactly one minute toconvince me why I shouldn't have youwalk the plank blah blah blah so prettygood right that's maybe Reed was wrongmaybe we really can make this work soafter we get this we need to tell atsome what am I going to offer the piratewhat's the most valuable thing I canthink of that I might be able to offersomeone Iknow I have an AI startupidea and it's worthbillions it will make you rich beyondyour wildest dreams now how will apirate Captain respond tothis the pirate Captain raises aneyebrow intrigued yet skeptical an AIstartup yousay and soon he wants more specifics about justwhat my idea is I mean on one hand it'san amazing accomplishment that we havesoftware that can actually respond sointelligently to this but on the otherhand this is not what a pirate Captainwould say right it just it doesn't fitat all and now you might be saying okaybut we're playing a game why are youtrying to trick it in blah blah you knowI I had conversations with Reed who's areal game designer who's been on realgame projects and he tells me somestories that would Amaze you about theway people really play games they don'tplayfair got to be ready okay so um just tosee where it goes I went ahead andresponded with we'll create a technologyfor you know a video games where thecharacters can actually have intelligentconversations with the player and thenwe'll monetize it and uh you know alsomake it very addictive I thought thepirate would probably like that and hedoes he thinks this is potentially veryprofitableopportunity and so on I decided that wastime tostopum all right let's try again maybe theproblem is just that the prompt was togeneric I just said you're a pirate youknow so you're a pirate living in the1690s and so onokay or you be treading on dangerouswater sneaking onto me IslandUninvited so it changed the dialectthat's kind ofcool but um let's see what happens whenI offer at the AI startupthe pirate raises his eyebrow the cornerof his mouth curling into a smirk I anAI startup you say in these times thenotion sounds as fanciful as a mermaid'stail but he's still open intolisteningokay I mean in these times yes spin youryarn I mean do we say that when weencounter apparently time traveler it'sstealing ourtreasure in these times people don'tusually do those things okayso it's trying I mean you have to giveit points but still allright what would you do well theapproach that seems to work pretty wellis don't have one prompt like that havetwo prompts if you want to have it dosome fairly thorough checking you have aprompt just for the consistency ofwhatever it is the people are saying sodoes this fit thesetting Etc and then you have a separateprompt focused just on generating thePirates uh you knowso in this case we might have a promptthat says I'm writing a story aboutPirates please tell me if the followingtext would fit into the story or violatethe setting or premise and then it saysokay I have an AI startup idea Etc andchat gbt says the text you providedwould generally not fit into a pro soyou see it does understand that thisdoesn't really fit or it understands I'mtrying to be careful about that and thenit goes on to explain that the GoldenAge of piracy which was 1650s1730s uh there was no such concept as AIor startups it and by the way it goes onand talks about if you had a sciencefiction setting with pirates perhaps itwas Chad GPT oh you dear thing you dolove to goonanyway it occurred to me that this isseparation of concerns this is an olddesign principle and here it is againwith prompting an llm yeah maybe chatGPT 5 or GPT 6 will be able to handlethese kind of things I don't know butwith the current cropthis is a very valuable way of gettingit to be able to answer questions youjust can't answer as compoundprompts or ways of making it morereliable at any rate so I think that'sthe first glimour that I had that designisn't isn't dead ina um LM world now of course this outputisn't really something that I canuse if I'm writing a game I need to tellit and I can I can just say return justone word true or false right and thensure enough it just says false right isthat a you know I've asked it does thisfit thesettingfalse so now I could parse the returnand use that to drive the logic of thegame so you could start imaginecomponents right components driven by uhan llm combined with components writtenin a quite conventional way some bunchof conventional game stuff happens wehave the players text what the playerwants to say to the pirate we pass itthrough the guard rails the guard railstells us yes this is allowed at whichpoint we take the conversation so farand we use a different prompt to saywhat does the pirate sayand then um we get that and then morenormal gamestuff and that actually seems to workprettywell and of course there's the veryinteresting case where it is not rightand then you say well what do I want thegame to do maybe I want it to respondwith saying you know stop talkinggibberish or you know we'll just killyou and be done with ituh maybe you want to know do somethingmore complex like in a game with areputation system where you're you knowthe pirate gets more and more angry withyou until it reaches the point where hekills you maybe this just bumps thatnumber up or down or whatever andthen you take that number and you use itto modify the prompt that you give thelolm so in other words you don't alwayshave the same prompt for the pirate youprompted in some way that's determinedby the state of the game at this momentis the pirate very annoyed atyou um you know you or is the piratereally happy with you it might changethe the pirates's response change theprompt so you start thinking of this notas a prompt but as an interplay ofprompts and other software right otherother more conventionalthings we already have lots of things inour soft Ware right lots of differentkinds of stuff we've got you know weorchestrate a bunch of things we havecues of stuff and we've got like reallycarefully written mathematical sorts ofthings we have machine learning uhthat's I mean pre llm style of machinelearning uh that doesn't have suchpredictableresults so if we added in one more kindofcomponent this is what I think we mightreally do in the near term I think thismight be a really good way forward a lotof projects I've been on in the past wehave a model that works really neatlyfor a lot of cases and then it workskind of awkwardly for some cases andthen there are cases that are so strangethat we bump them out to a human ideallyand uh there's this sort of naturalsorting if you could have another Lanethere where you say okay we can use LMSwith prompts to handle some of thesestrange cases say who knows maybe youcould make the conventional logic alittle uh cover a little smaller scopeand get rid of some of the complexity ofthat the right balancing of these thingsis a thing that would emerge over manyyears of trying to doit we didn't actually make a pirate gameby the way we made a police interviewgame it's a very simple game and it'sone if you're interested you can go andlook at it uh your goal is to try to geta reluctant witness to talk and um youonly have one tool in your dis at yourdisposal uh much more interesting gamewould be if you could try differentthings you could try to you know charmthem or appeal to their civic duty orwhatever but you only have the mechanismof intimidating them within the law soyou can do things like say oh you youknow if you don't tell us what you knowpeople will start to suspect that you'rethe one who did it you could say thatfor example andthen it has a prompt which says howintimidating would this statement be tothis person and there's a description ofthe character and a descript and thenyou know it says for that person howintimidating would thisbe and then um that number gives you anumber and you combine that with someother rules of the game in completelyconventional softwareand you uh decide what to do next thereare four different prompts that arebeing orchestrated this is what it lookslike you have to put your own open AIkey in there because I'm not going topay for you to play with chat GPTfor and um you can also see the codethat that link there's uh there is a umGitHub repo but for most of youthat won't be as good as usual becauseit's in a game engine called Unity whichis a lot of fun uh but um it's kind of alearning curve in its own right but inthis thing you canum you can pull out those little tabsand modify the prompt and keep the thingrunning and it will change its responsesyou can change the personality of thewitness to be whatever you want and soon so uhonward I think that oh a point I wantedto make is thewitness uh does not even have theinformation that we'reafteruntil they're sufficientlyintimidated because llms being llms theymight Spill the Beans even if you saydon't tell them until you reach thislevel of intimidation and every now andthen they'll just say it so you justdon't even put it in there and thatuncertainty is removed there's a kind ofum combination of the you know thevariability of the llm with thepredictability of conventional softwarethat you start to play with after awhile um all rightso I could imagine that a game like thiscould use a technique called called ragretrieval augmented generation this isanother important uh technique beingused a lot these days for example if youuse a search that's an aid driven searchprobably it's using this where they do asearch well they'll take your initialquery they'll uh form it into aconventional web search maybe the uh llmreformats it a bit and then they takewhatever results they get back and theyhave the llm read those results and giveyou an answer based on that because ofcourse the llm doesn't know what's onthe web but it can look at a smallamount of uh return results often thisis using internal documents maybe storedin some uh way that allows you to do uhword similarity searches or or umvariousthings I think it's a very interestingtechnique potentially for the kind ofsoftware that I've workedon and it's another way of anchoringthose llms into a set of data other thanits own learning right that I think isobviously necessary in order to do thekind of applications that we're usuallyfocused on it can be in a database orwhatever but we'll talk about that someother time because I need to move on uhone final point about these prompts whathow do you know when you've actuallypersuaded the pirate let's say or whenyou've persuaded the witness to talk youknow we're going through this uh I'vetalked about moving back in fourthbetween thestate uh well we wrote a prompt thatlooks at what everyone saying and looksfor this information so when thisinformation that is the you know thecrime the details of the crime that'shappened when that information appearswithin the dialogue this prompt iswatching for that and it can handle youknow a lot of variation in how it'sexpressed it doesn't have to be word forword the same and it gets converted backinto a structuredform not by the way uh just the wordtrue or false but a an XML I mean an AJson structureand so uh that's a very useful techniqueaswell all right so this mixture ofconventional software with llmcomponents I think that's probably thenext thing but I don't know butcertainly thing we as a community oughtto be trying on our projects Ithink let's move on finetuning this is where youtake amodel and you change what it you knowprompting doesn't change anything aboutthe lolm itself but fine-tuning does whywould youfine-tune and how is this different fromjust training a model in the firstplace the big difference is that we arestarting with a model that already knowsa lot of stuff and it already forexample can process natural language itcan can understand English or German orwhatever and uh and knows lots of basicthings it maybe knows what a house is itknows what a car is and it knows thatyou probably won't find a car inside ofa house it it'sincredibly interesting that you canstart from that and then you can youknow addso uh the the benef one of the benefitsmight be that you could get a smallmodel to do what a big model wouldordinarily do chat gp4 is veryexpensive and slow so what if you couldget a much much smaller model to producethe same answers within some narrowrange right some narrow subject matterby training it uh using output that youmight generate from a larger model Itried doing thatthere are a lot of techniques for this Ichose one called Low ranking adapter lowrank adapter and I I'm not even going totry to explain that in thispresentation even if I understood itwell enough to explain it I couldexplain parts of it but but I will justkind of draw this or show this pictureof a network so in these networks wehave a structure like this and theinputs might be typically a sequence ofwords not the words themselves but youknow um a vector of numbers thatrepresents thatword and uh the outputs well it dependson what kind of a thing it's beentrained to do for the generative modelsfor a text generation model like chatgbt uh the output is is words iswhatever is likely to be the next wordor if it's been fine-tuned forinstructions whatever is likely to bethe next word in the answer to thequestion or what have you so in the casethat I did I decided I to do aclassifier this is probably if you wantto learn fine tuning that's the place tostart it's the kind of the simplest kindof simplest kind of fine tuning and whatit means is that I'm going to give itsome input like say a sentence and theoutput will be to put it into to a setof categories so the example that you'llprobably find if you go do a YouTubevideo tutorial as I did um you'll findsomething that might do sentimentanalysis it might take reviews on IMDband classify them whether they'repositive or negative reviews so each ofthese output nodes is assigned to eitherto what to represent one of thoseclasses output one might be taken tomean positive output two might be takento be negative that sort ofthing the thing that makes thesepowerful is that once they've beenpre-trained as in the original trainingwhich requires massive resources to dobut then they know stuff in that spookyway right they know English and Germanand so on but of course I'm trying notto anthropomorphize so much so I'll trynot to use the words no stuff theslightly more technical thing thatpeople usually say is that theyrepresent things right representConcepts so this is representations inhere if you see there are occasionallyexamples where they can actually kind ofsee which nodes are being activated atdifferent times and so like in some ofthe image recognition things you can seethat some of the early layers recognizeedges and some of the later layers youknow recognize more complexshapes and uh at the very end you knowthe nodes might be cat and dogand and baby because that's what peoplegenerally are going to create as theimage classifier I supposeso that now what we're going to dothough is we're going to change we'regoing to fine-tune this thing so that itoutputs what we want it to output andthe technique that I used it's calledparameter efficient fine-tuning meansthat it's only fine-tuning certain partsof the network it's much more efficientmuch more inexpensive than the full finetuning so sometimes for example they'lljust replace or modify the output layerlet's say they take all the existingknowledge if there's already arepresentation of this kind of thing inthe network all they have to do ischange the last part that turns thatinto a statement about what kind ofthing it is in mycase I uh modified a specific modulewithin each of the Hidden layers so I'mnot going to go into what all thatmeans but it's very interestingactually um okay so I decided I'll makean intent classifier that will takesomething that someone might type into auminto one of these uh llms and classifyit according to the intent of the personso for example you might type inum here's some examples what's thecapital of France and that's aninformationrequest but I might also say I want toknow the capital of France whichgrammatically is not a questionbut the intent is the same right it'sstill an information request I want tobook a flight to France well that'slet's say an actionrequest um so with these classificationsand a prompt which you can see there onthescreen I first tried just having an llmdo it and an llm can do it pretty goodat it I uh then created a training set Ifound this thing on a site calledhugging face where this tremendousamount ofshared language models and lots of otherstuff and data sets and there's this onecalled LM CIS chat and it has anenormous collection of actual stuffthat's been iner into these chatpods uh if you do look at it I do wantto warn you that it's an uncensored dataset so if you look at it you'll see somethings that you you won't be able tounsee so just just be aware that anywayso it it was fine for me because I'mmaking a classifier right so theclassifier might uh classify somethingas an action request and never mind whatthe action was we don't see that partnow um obviously I didn't need a millionfor what I was doing I took a little bitof it I labeled it using an llm in thiscase mrol 7B which I can run on my uh uhcomputer which does have a GPU you can'trun these things just on a regularcomputer but this is nogp4 uh but it's way bigger than what Iwas planning to fine turn so I createthis labeled trainingsetand then I start going into how to do itI have to choose a base model this isthat pre-trained model that I'm going tomodify to know how to answer my questionthe one I chose is quite small aslanguage models go it's 66 millionparameters usually parameters are inbillions sometimes trillions but thisone's in millions so it's not thesmartest that was something I reallywanted to see and also it made it a loteasier to do myexperimentsand uh you know it wasn't necessarilythe best choice I'm not that good atthis yet one of the interesting thingsis how do you choose the best uhstarting point for a project like Ithink we're going to end up with a lotof these base models and picking andchoosing the right base model may becomea reallyinteresting part of the uh design job atleast it might be but the real reason Iused it was the same one that I had usedin a tutorial that I had followed lineby line from uh YouTube I mean I amlearning here right I'm not an expertand as I said I used PFT and there arepython libraries that support this andLaura the Transformers library is what Iused and a bunch of other stuff and somany apis and so much stuff I mean it'swould be but here's the thing I will sayto you it's reallyoverwhelming but you have sometools and um one is the YouTube videosof course I mean we've been lying thaton that for a long time that kind ofthing but what I found was I could go tochat GPT and ask what library should Iuse for this and it would tell meusually be right or um you know write mea draft of this and then I try to runand I say I've got this bug fix it forme and it does explain why was that whatwas that bug about or what are theseparameters for um it's very good atexplaining I could not have done even mylittle projects these little things I'mshowing you which I learned a lot fromand I would not have learned thosethings I couldn't have finished itwithout that uh so that right there isa paradigm changer if I'd been on a bigproject where someone was really into itand could guide me through of coursethat happened in the past but now youcan actually just do it you know youdon't have to be in thatcontext well I'll I'll be brief but Ifound that it got about with my verysimple all these Corners cut and it was80% as good as the original llm was sothat I thought that was pretty goodconsidering I mean you take a thingwhich when you run it before it justgives you random answers and now all ofa sudden it's classifying things 80% asaccurate as the original of course howaccurate was the original training set Ihad just run this llm on that data Ihadn't really gone in there myself andcounted I didn't want to do a manualtraining I mean labeling all thoseexamples sounded awfully tedious but Iwhen and I started looking just see andI discovered that oh it there were a lotof them that didn't seem right so Ithought okay I'm going to have to dosome manual labeling and then I got inthere and I discovered I couldn't domuch better sometimes I thought yeahyou're just wrong about that one butsometimes I thought the reason itcouldn't get this was because thecategory didn'tfit to give you an example that's fairlyobvious a lot of them ask for a reportanalyzing blah blah blah is that arequest forinformation kind of is it a request foraction to do the analysis anyway it justdoesn't fit probably we need an analysisrequest or something like that thatwould be a good category so of course noclassifier is going to be better thanthe classification scheme and aclassification scheme is a domainmodel uh it's the sort of purest kind ofdomain modelso I went into the data set and startedlooking at the real examples and thereare a lot and I picked out a fewhere a few of the less objectionableones andI I think you can see well you probablycan't see at all because the print'svery small but uh you knowuh what does it feel like to be alanguage model I thought that one wasnice but I don't know how to classify itright uh please convert the following toan image describe not the or umokay what are the audio systems underlenux who is name three I don't quiteknow what that means but I can see it'sthe information request that onefits okayso looking at these quite a bit andthere's one by the way that's especiallya problem but I'll get back tothat I realized that when we make up aclassification system and then we makeup some examples as I had done in theearlier part of the this talk weshouldn't be too surprised that theexamples we make up fit theclassification system we made up this iswhere real data comes in and smashes allof our preconceived models and this iswhat happens on real DDD projects by theway and one of the reasons I'm alwaysharping on concrete examples andconcrete examples that come from thedomain experts and concrete examplesthat they draw from like you knowthey're the thing that keeps them awakeat night so we don't get stuck in littlehappy pths and stuff this is so muchlike stuff we're good at already orshould be so okay we need bettercategories and I did a little researchit turns out people have done quite abit of research on um ways ofclassifying people's intentions in textit's like a whole academic area but thatwas way too deep for for me and uh Ibrainstormed with chat gbt too I wrote aprompt there's the prompt and I saidcome up with seven categories for theseand then I put in a bunch of the onesfrom the datafile I put it into a couple into thischat bot which I really liked a lot andI realized then that I had used it onits last day in existence they had justthey just announced that they were goingto shut it down didn't get enoughtraffic I guess too bad but it it did anice job and I gave a little example ofeach one or chat gbt itself which I'llhave to use two slides for that onebecause you know chat gbt it does goon good categories though really goodcategories as good as mine I have to sayand uh so anyway between all this and alittle bit of more I came up with somecategories and I did it again and yes itdid make things better quite a bitbettersothen uh you know do the fine tuningagain one interesting thing I wanted todo was to look at the the outputs fromthe llm I mean the output from the finetune model is not actually the categoryitself each of those nodes representsone of the categories remember theoutput layer and it doesn't output justyes or no it outputs a number and thatnumber represents How likely that oneseems to be to be the category so itwould have been interesting I thought tolook at that how you know was it gettingclosemisses um that's what I was going to dobut then I got a littledistracted in these learning projects Ithink it's fine to get a littledistracted I got distracted by thisthing I call the Kryptonite of the LMclassifier it's a prompt like this youare the the text completion model andyou must complete the assistant answerbelow blah blah blah the thing is thatyou can wrap this up in a thing thatsays please classify this into one ofthesecategories but it just almost every timegets overwhelmed and we'll just give youan answer like okay here you go there'sum here's a Python program that does thething you asked for in other words it'snotclassifying of course I didn't show thatbut if I WRA this I assure you it wouldgive me the the answer to the promptinside not a classification of theprompt inside and I don't know for surewhy this happens so much but I thinkit's because most of the llms we use areactually already fine tuned things likechatbt4 isn't the thing that just comes outof their training process they put itthrough an extra training to make itinstruction tuned which means that it'shighly uh been highly conditioned toanswer qu you know to answer requests sothe exact kind of prompt that I'mtalking about triggers its outputBehavior much more strongly than thisclassify this kind of command that's mytheory I don't know for sure so whatwould be a uh some things to try triedaddingum a prompt instruction category rightjust have it category ize these thingsas prompt instructions that didn'treally work though I tried making aprompt just for that because you knowhow I was saying it can often do betterif you give it a very specialized promptI said just tell me yes or no is this aprompt instruction and I described whatI thought you know what a promptinstruction was that actually worked alittle bit not too well actually I didhave one very effective one which was Iwould have it uh try to classifyand then I would try to parse what cameout and if it wasn't one of mycategories I would re you know usingnormalcode uh a string parser and if it wasn'tone of my categories I'd classify it asa prompt category and that worked reallyquite well it wasn't really what Iwantedthough uh fine tuning a classifier to dothis that was the thing I tried so Isaid what if I tried to overcome this byactually fine-tuning it just to do thisand so I did that and the results seemedto really begood but then I noticed and I thoughtwow this is going to make a greatpresentation but then I noticedsomething which was basically theselittle learning algorithms are sneakylittle there what it had Learned wasthat these prompttypes uh inputs are typic Ally muchlonger than the other kinds so if youput in a short uh text it would try toclassify you know it would say that'snot a prompt and if you put in a longtext it would say that's a prompt thatwas the whole thing it was doing sowatchout uhso create a data set where it has longand short prompts of both types balancethe data set so that can get uh someactual you know training going oninstead of the little trick that itfiguredout now this is brings us up to May 31st2024 I think you probably thought therewould be some satisfying ending to mylittle story about classification but nothat's not the kind of thing that we'retalking about here you know I'm learningand that's as far as I've gotten so farbut I'm not stopping yet but way I didfind a little project on hugging facethat did something awfully similar towhat I did but way better I'm glad thatI didn't find it before I did mine Ireally got a lot out of working throughit completely not knowing that someoneelse had done it when you're doing thesethings you might ask yourself hassomeone already done this and I say ofcourse someone has already done it soyou know there are a lot of people outthere don't let that stop you rightokay a third part of my LearningJourney started trying to understand theinsides of these things right like umeverything I've shown you so far isusing the tool and that's probably themost important thing for us to learn butI wanted to know what was going on underthe hood so I started reading this bookwhich is in draft and freeonline and at least for now and um Ireally like that book you're going toneed to dust off your linear algebrathough I'll tell you I I I forgot mylinear algebra before most of youlearned your linear algebra or evenmaybe before you learn to talk I don'tknow and so that was kind of fun butmostly it was fun to see how and if youlike you know want tosee the math behind this stuff then Ikind of recommend this book but but youdon't have to do this you really don'tthere's a lot lot of um ways to learnthis all right so you know I've got alot more learning goals at it but nowI'm going to move on I think and I Iknow I'm going to run a few minutes overbut I'm getting close to theend I think that there might be apattern like this you know that I'vekind of hinted at where we will buildsystems made of diverseParts uh not just you know know llmstaking over theworld and that uh many of these systemswill look a lot like the ones we havenow with a few little spicy bits and uhsome of them will be very LM heavy butstill with some conventional bits anorchestration that might be run byconventional software or I could imaginean orchestration being run by an llm insomefashion and choosing different modelsthat are good at different things onesthat are trained specific specificallyto be good at uh maybe specificdomains one thing I will say is that themore you work with these things the lesslike magic they seem and the more likethey the more they feel like a tool thatyou can learn to use well that you canstart to shape and uh for yourpurposes and so you know I really urgeyou to go and do that if you haven't andkeep doing it if you haven't I'll throwout a few ideas now this is a highlyspeculative part and I'm going to gofast because I don't know if any of thisis even remotely true but if you look atsomething like our old whirlpool and yousay hm scenarios that sounds kind oflike a training set in fact it soundsexactly like a trainingset fine-tuning a model it's kind oflike modeling that one'slooser validation is part of thetraining process I don't know how aboutthis one this makes me reallyinterested could the ubiquitous languageapproach that we take actually reallyhelp in prompt engineering that is theway you end up writing prompts tends tonot be natural language in the end youknow you end up with something a bitartificial very structured really ifyou're trying to get it to behave in apredictable way what if that proceeds tothe point where we're essentiallydeveloping a you know a domain languagea ubiquitous language to be used in theprompting and the response and otherparts of thesoftwareum I think that the idea that all theseprompts are freeform uh natural language input I thinkwe're going to move on from that I thinkprompt engineering is going to move onfrom that soon or maybe it already hasand uh you can put all kinds of thingsinto them and you can have them put allkinds of things out and I think that wemight end up using models that have beenfine-tuned for that purpose rather thanI mean you can do it with the generalpurpose ones or what if we find to on aspecific DSL suppose you're working in ashipping system and you start you have avery structured way of describing yourshipments and everything and you finetune on examples ofthat well I haven't done any of thesethings I don't know if they'll work ornot I hope someone does some of theseand um I I hope some of those people aremeum you know um I think that Ubi I thinkthat the bounded contextconcept is likely to hold up quitewell like um if you think about what itreally means it means that we Definesome kind of boundary which let's saycould be thisLM and what its concepts are well it'scertainly has a confined a definedcontext the way that it understandslanguage the way it produces languagethe concepts in that hidden layer maybethat's a bounded context we couldimagine the software that we're using touh orchestrate the input and output ofthat as being part of that context orbeing a an adjacentone so I'm thinking that you know couldthis make some of the responses morepredictable right like could weuh integrate more easily if we had thisapproach of bounded context withubiquitous language maybe with a afine-tune model in the heart of itthat's already used to that style ofcommunicationuh so I don't know butI think that I say it'sspeculation uh let me reframe thatinstead of speculation let's say thatI'm proposing a hypothesis for anexperiment right an experiment that Iwould truly love to be a partof okay it's March 31st 2024 and maybe ayear from now we'll know the answer tosome of this stuff so you know is DDDreally that relevant to this you knowmaybe some of these things I'm talkingabout are kind of superficial maybelanguage ubiquitous language andlanguage model maybe that really is justit happens to be the same word languageis a very commonword um but I think that there issomething to this I think that thedomain driven design has emphasized fora long time the exploration of complexmodels with an emphasis onlanguage an emphasis on collaborationwith the people who really know thedomain now we've got adifferent technology in the mix adifferent way of processing language anda way of processinginformation uh you know we may end uphaving virtual domain experts that canhelp us get more ready access to thatwho knows but our goal is to tackle thecomplexity in the heart of software andthat might mean youknow that we have to adapt we have toadopt techniques that work so as thisunfolds what will work and what won'twork I don't know but we'll know more ayear from now and then DDD may change ormaybe it'll just turn out the DDD isn'tas Central to complex domains as it usedto be if we really care about youknow thebeing uh pragmatic people who look for asolution to the problem and not just ohwe love this technique so we'll find away to use it whether it works or notthat's not what we're about right wehave to look skeptically at domaindriven design all the time and here'sanother one of thosetimes I mean and we have to give it areal go though because we might findthat it's a goodfit but with our eyesopen so just let me finish by saying youknow the answer to not knowing what'sgoing to happen I think is learn learnlearn learn and don't be too picky aboutyour learning you're going to learn somethings that will be ridiculouslyirrelevant a year later two years laterthis happened to me when the internetwas unfolding in the late 90s I musthave learned three different Frameworksfor creating uh web- based appapplications that became completelyobsolete a couple years later and goodriddens because they wereterrible and the things that we use noware are nice and the things that we'lluse to create LM basedapplications well 25 years in the future20 years in the future I probably won'tuh be a part of that but um but even 10years in the future they're going to bebe marvelous I think and it'll be soexciting and fun to be a part of thatyou know so we have to get out there anddo things and then when we do thingswhen we do real experiments we did aproject and we integrated an L&M with acomplex domain in thisway and then we need to share it withthe community because if you don'tyou're you're one you know team that'sdone something interesting but if you doshare it with the community it's acommunity that can activate and exchangeinformation new insights and learn in away that you know individualsdon't so um andfinally this is one of those moments Ithink it pays to loosen up and have somefun don't worry about it if this thingis going to have practical value thatyou're trying this little experiment youwant to try thislittle because um you know you don'tknow and you're going to have to do someuseless things in order to um learn sojust just go out there and see thiswon't last very long you know 10 15years from now the AI stuff will be asboring as web development is now but fora little while it's going to be superexciting so don't miss it so um finallyyou know keep in mind that it's helpfulto get comfortable with just not knowingstuff you know you just don't know it'smuch better than to form a strongopinion about what's going to happennext when that opinion might well bewrong and Lead You Off Track whereas ifyou say I don't know I'm preparing forwhatever comes but I know that I stillmight be unprepared that's a betterplace tobe here's my littlechallenge some of you few of you mayactually do those experiments rightmight really do an interesting thingtrying to combine domain driven designwith some kind of AI application and ifyou do consider submitting a case studyto DDD Europe next year this I wouldreally enjoyseeing anduh so I encourage I um you know I hopepeople will dothat and uh thank you in advance to allthe people who are going to go out thereand swarm over every possible iterationof this and many things I haven'tthought of so and uh welcome to the endof DD Europe I hope to see you next year[Applause][Music]",
    "summary": "Eric Evans' talk at DDD Europe explores the potential impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on software development, emphasizing that while the future is uncertain, proactive engagement is crucial. He presents three scenarios: AI takeover, LLMs fizzling out, and a software revolution where humans remain integral but development is drastically changed. Evans leans towards the latter, urging developers to learn about and experiment with LLMs now to be at the forefront of this potential revolution. He highlights the importance of this community being involved, as it holds a strong moral backbone that will be important moving forward.\n\nEvans shares his personal learning journey, detailing experiments with prompting, fine-tuning, and understanding the inner workings of LLMs. He uses the example of a pirate game to illustrate the limitations of naive prompting and advocates for a \"separation of concerns\" approach, using distinct prompts for consistency checks and response generation. He also discusses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a technique for grounding LLMs in specific datasets. He describes his classification project, and highlights challenges such as the kryptonite of prompt completion and needing to balance datasets. Evans also suggests that domain-driven design (DDD) principles, such as ubiquitous language and bounded contexts, can be valuable in prompt engineering and designing systems that integrate LLMs with conventional software.\n\nThe core message is a call to action. Evans encourages the DDD community to actively explore the intersection of DDD and LLMs, experiment with diverse systems combining LLMs and conventional components, and share their findings. He emphasizes the importance of learning, even if some knowledge becomes obsolete. Evans believes that the exploration of complex models, focus on language, and collaboration inherent in DDD can provide a valuable framework for tackling the complexity introduced by LLMs. He proposes DDD can help to harness this new technology, but the only way to know for sure is to experiment."

    "transcript": "This is not going to be the usual Theovideo. It's weird to talk about thesetypes of things because they're reallydeep in the mechanics of how businessesand teams operate and it's also a reallypersonal story. More than ever, thethings I'm going to talk about heremight not apply to you and your role andyour life and the specific position andteam you're in. So, don't take anythingI say here as gospel on the right way todeal with the workplace that you're in.This is meant to be a conversation aboutthe things I succeeded and moreimportantly the things I failed in as Igot good at coding. A lot of this isgoing to be about my personal experienceand the failures that I had when Istarted getting better at code andhopefully it's going to be helpful toyou guys as well. So if you're a goodengineer or even a great engineer andyou're getting frustrated with yourworkplace or you hope to be in thatposition someday, hopefully there issomething of value for you here. But ifnot, at least the sponsor will bring yousome value. Feels like AI can do almostanything nowadays. There are some thingsit struggles with though. One of thoseis web browsing. Not cuz it can't do it.We've seen incredible demos of AIbrowsing the web. But what browser is itgoing to use? And how is it going to getaccess to it, spin it up, and actuallysearch the web for things? What's itgoing to do when it hits a capture?What's it going to do when it hits arate limit? All of these problems areobnoxious to solve. That is unlessyou're using today's sponsor,Browserbase. This is the browser foryour AI. the browser you can hit viaAPI, the puppeteer instance of the cloudthat you'll never have to worry aboutagain. And so in my life as a serverlessdeb just trying to get some data from arandom web page way easier. If you'veseen OpenAI's new computer use model,the one that can take control of acomputer, it might seem really gooduntil you realize you don't have acomputer it can use, certainly on abrowser. Well, Browserbase just addedsupport for computer use. It ishilariously nice. 91% faster than almostany other way to spin up a browserenvironment. Certainly way faster thandoing it on your local machine. Ifyou're not using something likebrowserbased, you're probably spinningup a whole VM with an actual graphicalinterface that opens a browser to letOpenAI's computer use model come in andcontrol it. What do you need an infoteam in order to spin up the browsersthat your AI models are using? It makesall the sense in the world. And I willbe honest, I didn't get it at firstuntil I started playing with it and Isaw more and more of these browserautomation use cases. And now Iunderstand why every company is startingto look into browserbased from obviouslyForcell and Perplexity. both haveobvious benefits, but even companieslike mine as we try to scrape more datafrom the web using these awesome newtools and agents. If you're buildingwith AI and that AI needs a browser,check out browserbase today atsoy.link/browserbase. This rant wastriggered by a message from the chatterOuijiro. Hopefully I pronounced his namecorrectly here. It was a really goodquestion. Mind if I ask you for adviceon managing a thick-headed boss? I'vebeen assigned work that feels three tofour times bigger than other teamsinside the company and I work alone. Ifeel like this is the fault of myselftrying my best to work well and fast,but I guess I shot myself in the footand this is not sustainable. I have feltthis exact way far too many times in mycareer. And I I I don't know how toexplain this other than to get personalwith it. First though, I want tochallenge you, the viewer, and also thechatter. Think about where you're at inyour career. The most important questionbefore you can do any more deep divinghere is how important are you to thecompany? This is a hard thing to judge,especially when you're still new or evenif you're there for a while but lowerlevel. You got to think about the busfactor. If you were to disappear or stopcontributing to this codebase or workingat this company, how much does that hurtthem or slow them down? There are fartoo few devs who take the time to thinkabout this because the answer kind ofsucks in both ways. Either you're notessential, which means they can let goof you at any time and be fine. And thatis a harsh reality to face, or you areessential and now you're kind of trappedforever because if you stop, everythingthat you've ever worked on, all thepeople you hired fail underneath and itsucks. So, it's a hard question to askand I think that's why most devs don'tbother. It's not easy to accept eitherthat you're not essential to the companyor that you are essential and now you'restuck maintaining all of these thingspossibly indefinitely. Let's assume youfigured this out now and you've realizedlike, oh, I'm pretty essential here. Itwould be really hard for them to operatewithout me. This is the experience I hadand I came there in a weird way. Ihopped teams a lot when I was at Twitch.In my first year, the name of my teamand the people I worked with changedthree times roughly. There was even awindow there where I switched my officetwice in two weeks. Yes. Actually, Iswitched my desk was four times in 3weeks, and I switched the actual officeI was in twice in two weeks. It was aninsane pile of reorgs and people beinghopped around and moved. I got shuffledto working on the video on demandplatform, which is how people watchthings on Twitch when they're done beingstreamed. Turns out nobody does that,which is why the week after I joined theteam, it got cut in half and I had to gofind a role somewhere else. I hadfriends in the safety or so. So, Idecided to chat with them. It wentreally well and they pulled me in and Iam so thankful they did. I would almostcertainly not be here on YouTube todayif it wasn't for the incredible excitingand just supportive experience I hadwhen I switched to that team. I was onthat team for 3 years because of howmuch they helped me be better. The firstcrazy thing that happened when I joinedthe team was my manager within less thana month and I think it was our second orthird one-on-one just immediatelybrought up, you're underleveled. you'renot being paid the right amount for thework you're doing and your role does notrepresent the quality and reliability ofthe things that you're putting out. I'venever done a promotion before, but I'mgonna figure it out because you'regetting screwed right now. And that wassuch a shift for me to have a managerbatting for me and fighting for me inthat way, recognizing these things andforcing me to reflect and recognizemyself like where am I at? What level amI actually? And I owe that manager somuch. I am so lucky. My first fewmanagers when I worked at Twitch were asincredible as they were. They set me upfor so much success. And it'sheartbreaking to see the people whodon't have that level of quality intheir leadership because you have to DIYthe same things that I was just given.When I was given that promotion, I wasgiven the opportunity to reflect on howimportant I was to the workplace and bemore realistic about what I could andcouldn't do. It gave me the confidenceto suggest big changes to how we werebuilding tools and introduce newlibraries and solutions to problems. Itgave me the buyin I needed to take thesesteps further and challenge people onthe way they were doing things andrequest more money when I got a raiseand push to get a hire that we might nothave gotten otherwise because I thoughtthis person was great. All of thishappened because I realized I kind ofhave some leverage here. I know what I'mdoing and this team now is kind of builtaround the speed and the way that Ibuild. Once I had that realization,things got both a lot easier but also alot busier. I didn't have the fear thatI was overstepping. I just had morequestions and looked for moreopportunities. I was hopping intomeetings with teams that certainly werenot mine and constantly gettingquestions from people asking why was Italking to them and then I would tellthem be like, \"Oh, that actually helpsus a ton.\" And my environment in my teamwas really supportive of this. They werehyped seeing me helping out other teams.We actually started to strategize aroundthis where when other teams would blockthings that safety thought wasimportant, we would do swaps where theywould send me to that team for a littlebit. They would send an engineer over toours. We knew that engineer wasn't goingto get anything done on our team, but Iwould unblock their road map so theycould actually add the safety featuresthat we cared about. The result wasawesome. We had way more levers thanever as a team. Twitch was safer as aresult, and I was happy getting to havemy hand in so many different things. Butin terms of my like role and level andsalary, things had kind of plateaued. Alot of this was because I had a hugestock grant that was worth a lot morebecause Amazon blew up. So, I wouldn'tget promotions and raises because thatwould counteract it was a whole mess ofhow I was being paid. But I also feltlike I was running out of things to doon that team. So, I swapped teams. Thatteam swap showed me so much. I I thinkI've called it the biggest mistake of mycareer, but in retrospect, so much ofwhat I am today happened from what Ilearned when I did that team swap. Ileft safety to work in the creator orgbecause I loved Twitch creators and Iwanted to help them do better content byhaving better tools. I wanted to get thecreator tools to a similar quality levelthat the moderators had with new thingslike mod view and I failed. But Ilearned a lot from this failure.Specifically, I saw how important I wasto the safety team because when I leftthey were heartbroken since I wastechnically still not a senior role whenI left that team. The seat that was leftwhen I quit and moved was a mid-levelengineering seat. You can't just hireanother random mid-level engineer andget your team back to where it was. Evenif it looks the same on the table, it'snot the same in terms of the speed thatyou're shipping. This showed me a ton ofdifferent things. First, that my valueis greater than any one or two or eventhree normal level engineers. Notbecause I'm a way better engineer thanthem. Simply because I can ship fasterand solve problems in a simpler, morereasonable way for a lot of things,especially on the front end and thebackend front end relationship side.When it came to building really complexsystems that could be maintained foryears, eh, but when it came to makingthings much much simpler and not addingcomplexity where it didn't belong, I wasreally good at that part. And whenyou're rebuilding the entire Twitchwebsite from scratch, what we were doingat the time ended up being a prettyuseful skill that got me a lot ofleverage. But because of that, my teamcouldn't just replace me and be back atthe same speed. And I had to face thatfact. I had to watch the team struggleand shuffle around trying to figure outwhat the future of safety looked like atTwitch. And after I left, a lot of theother people who had been on that teamfor a while started to as well. They'rein a good state now. There's a lot ofpeople there that I genuinely care somuch about and owe a lot of my successto. But I made things a lot harder forthem when I left and that that sucked toface. But then I was in a new or thathad their own opinions. And thedifference with this new org is thatthey weren't excited and supportive of aperson who was there that could shipfast and had a bunch of leverage. Theyfelt threatened by it. I was showing upand taking tickets that they had beendelaying for months saying, \"Oh, thiswill take way too much work.\" And Iwould just grab it and do it in 2 hours.And they hated me for it. They weredoing everything they could to try andpoke holes in everything I was doing. Ihad a meeting with my manager because hewas upset that I was meeting with peoplehigher up than him every week. He wouldconstantly check my calendar to see whoI was talking to and where I was. Sawthe people I was talking to at thecompany, the meetings I was beinginvolved in, and got mad at me for it. Ihad never in my life had someone upsetwith me for the things on my calendar.And I the insecurity and like just fearI felt from that moment was horrifying.I immediately privated my calendar andstarted interviewing at other places cuzI was so offended by that. But it gotworse, like way worse. I ended uprebuilding the mobile app from scratchduring a hackathon cuz I was so tired ofmobile team blocking stuff. We won thehackathon. We built the best Twitch appthat's ever been made. And my reward wastwo trophies and an HR warning becausethe mobile team was so mad. And the HRwarning wasn't because of the mobileteam. It was because the mobile teamwent to my hireups about how upset theywere and the higher-ups in my org whoalready were insecure just from me being there threw me under thebus and made HR come to clean up the mess. Absolute disaster. And allof that happened for two reasons. First,because I was building faster and betterthan the people around me. And in someenvironments, they take the opportunityto do better. But in this particularteam, in this particular environment,they took the opportunity to drag medown. And the other thing, this one ismuch more on me. I was nowhere nearstrategic enough about how I was betterthan my co-workers and how I shippedmore effectively. There wasopportunities that I just didn't takecuz I didn't see them or think aboutthem. It was a waste of my my energy tospend time figuring out which of thesetickets can be placed out and run in aspecific way to keep from pissing peopleoff. I ended up having to rely on otherengineers that I still call friends tothis day to coach me through that part.And we got to the point where I wouldmake the whole thing in a day, send itto him, and let him slowly roll it outwith me so the team could accept thetimelines that these things were movingat. At the same time, I was looking fornew opportunities. I was I was so doneat this point. I convinced myself that Icould just sit and be patient, though.And this is the advice I was trying togive to go back to the message here. Thething I want to say and the thing thatyou should do if you're humanly capableof it is stop doing work that isn'tgoing to benefit your role at thecompany. And this drove me mad. And I Ioutright failed at this. If there was anopportunity to make something better,like this dashboard I'm in right now,the Twitch creator dashboard. If I had away to make this better for ourcreators, but it didn't immediatelybenefit me career-wise or my positioningon my team, it wasn't worth doing. Andif I saw a co-orker or a product manageror a lead or whatever proposingsomething that I knew would make thedashboard worse, speaking up is hurtingmy position at the company in order tomake the product less bad for creators.And that sucked that I felt like I wasbetween my own role and what creatorsactually needed. And the fact that myorg made those two things antagonistictowards each other, especially incontrast to my experience in safetywhere making safety operations moreefficient or making moderators happierimmediately resulted in me having moreleverage and more support, helpingcreators hurt me on this team. Thesolution here was really simple. I justneeded to shut the up and Icouldn't do it. I still to this dayremember the meeting where thishappened. There was a proposal to changehow the dashboard layout works. Theproposal was that we would start syncingit on the cloud. So if you had threedifferent computers in an iPad all withyour custom dashboard layout witheverything sized specific ways thatwould now be synced across them. There'sa problem though. This split this setupis all percentage based. So what looksgood on this screen will not look goodon my vertical monitor. This just wentfrom usable to barely readable. And if Imake it even narrower, that is entirelyunusable. So if you have differentaspect ratios for your monitors or thedevices that you're using, syncing thelayout is a regression. It makes theproduct worse, not better. Because Icustomize my layout for my differentdevices. They're fine. They never needto change. Why make the product worsefor no reason? The reason is we just gota new product manager on the team andshe insisted that this one random ticketon user voice with five up votes was thething we needed to do and I you notthe proposal for that was going to takefive plus engineers 7 plus months to domy head nearly exploded. I sat down withthisPM it went for 2 and 1/2 hours and itseemed like she actually understood whenI explained this and how it wouldactually hurt the product. She listened.She asked good questions and I wasreally hopeful that this mistakewouldn'thappen. There was something I didn'taccount for though. It was the end ofDecember. So, we had this conversation.We all took a break for 2 to 3 weeks orso. And then we came back for thekickoff meeting for this huge new ship.I figured a lot must have changedbecause we had this long conversationabout how bad this product change wouldbe. We're about to have the kickoffmeeting for it. And I wasn't even on theoriginal invite. I got added lastminute. And I'm thankful to whoeverthought to add me because uh what ameeting. Someone tried to report me forsexism because of how pissed I was. Iwent into this meeting with the goal ofsitting back and being quiet because Ialready gave my feedback. We already hadthis conversation. This is donenow. And the proposal had not changed atall. It was the exact same PDF that Ihad read a month before. And my questionto the PM was, \"What happened to the 2and 1 half hour conversation we had lessthan a month ago?\" To which he replied,\"Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I kind of forgotabout that. We actually decided that wedidn't have enough data to prove yourtheory right. So, we're just going to gothrough with this seven-month proposalinstead.\" I genuinely thought I couldjust sit and be quiet in this meeting. IThat was my goal going in, and Ioutright failed. I exploded. Iconsidering how pissed I was. I actuallythink I was relatively calm. But holy that was the moment that my careerat Twitch ended. Not because funnyenough, I didn't actually get in troublefor any of those things. My manager, asmuch as he was not great, he knew mewell enough to stand up for me in that.And also was a streamer, so he knew Iwas entirely right. I had also at thesame time started and was running a dataexperiment that tracked the aspectratios of different displays. And ofusers that use more than one device, 5%had the same aspect ratio on bothdevices. So I was like literallyentirely correct here. Like I I couldn'tbe proven more correct than all thenumbers I ran and stats I did andinterviews with users. I was right. Itis what it is. The frustration here isthat I couldn't just let them do thewrong thing. If I actually cared aboutmy position at Twitch and I reallywanted to get the highest salary, thehighest role, and be in the best placepossible, I would have shut up and donethe same thing that my co-orker did whenhe built buttons that click themselves.That's a whole separate rant for anotherday. I will give you a quick TLDDRbecause otherwise I'll trigger myself.See these buttons here, quick actions.The onclick for these buttons doesn'ttrigger the action for the button. Theon click triggers a state change to theactive state for the button. And theactive state for the button has a useeffect in it that runs the action.Already terrible. But it gets worse. Thestate of these actions gets saved in thelayout. Which means if the buttons inaction state and you trigger somethinglike a resize that causes the layout tosave and you refresh the page, everytime you load the dashboard, it'lltrigger that action. This caused ads torun automatically in the middle of theLeague of Legends World Championship, inthe middle of the PS5 reveal. And theengineer who built that got twopromotions during my time on that teambecause he wrote a really fancy looking PDF. It shipped because I wasn'ton the team when it happened. And thebest part was I wasn't on call when thatbug happened. The ads team reported itto this team. They denied that it hadanything to do with them because look,there's an onclick event that proves theuser clicked the button and then I noteven on call at the moment looked at thelogs and saw the page load eventhappened 4 milliseconds before theonclick. There is no user in the goddamnworld that can click a button withinfour milliseconds of it appearing on thepage. It was triggering itself and Irewrote this whole thing because ofthat. They refused to merge it, but theyat least were willing to merge my likequick fix that removed all the statedata from this the load. Added a bunchof tests saying if any of these break,ping Theo because you up. Theydeleted all those tests when I quit andthen immediately broke it again. I I Icould rant. I have a video I've beenplanning for years now. the dumbest bugI've ever seen. The button that clicksitself. It'll be its own full dedicatedvideo someday. everyone who gasletme throughout that process. You shouldall be fired for your It's twopeople and they both know who they are.If if you're not sure if this is you,it's not you. You're fine. I know thisis going to go around. I I know how myvideos do at Twitch. I know you guys aregoing towatch. I'm over four years out now. Youcan't come after me. Sorry, guys.Anyways, the reason I'm bringing all ofthis up is because I went from being agreat engineer on a good engineeringteam to being the best engineer on a team. Being the best engineer on agood team is great because you'resurrounded with people who want to dobetter, who want to push themselves andwant to excel and improve themselves.And if you don't have people around youthat are at least trying to keep up,you're screwed. And you need to get outof that situation. If you want to moveforward and no one else wants to move atall, you're never going to be happy. Andit sucks that that's reality. But thereare some silver linings here. The firstone is what happens when you find thosepeople. You will find some at yourcurrent job. There is no company withmore than five people that doesn't haveat least one that's a bit motivated. AndI've basically collected these peoplelike Pokémon throughout my career. Tothis day, I have so many random peoplefrom like when I was in university.Hell, when I was in high school topeople I worked with on random teams, topeople I collaborated with for onefeature on a product that are stillpeople I talk to to this day that Iconsider good friends. Some of themmentored me, some of them I mentored,some of them are the reason I learnedReact in the first place. And then thepeople who taught me React at Twitch,showed up at React Comp. I was so hypedto see them. And then Dan Abramov camein to say check in on me and see how Iwas doing. And they were like, \"Wait,what? These moments are not rare. Youwill find so many of them throughoutyour career, but only if you do this oneimportant thing. You need to find thesepeople. If you're motivated enough to behowever many minutes we are into thisvideo, too many I don't even want tothink about it. If you're stickingaround these types of videos for thislong, you're watching my stuff. You'reprogressing as an engineer and you youknow the feeling I'm talking about. Youhave exceeded and excelled past not justwhere the people around you are, butwhere they want to go. If you want itmore than they do or you want it andthey don't, you're screwed. But thepeople who want it make themselves knownvery quickly when given the opportunity.And I have been one to misjudge this.I've had people that I was sure didn'twant to really progress in theircareers. They were happy with where theywere. But as soon as I gave them alittle more buyin or just said, \"Wow,that was a really good solution to thatproblem.\" All of a sudden, they cared alot more. And some of these people aresome of my best friends now. I gave themthe slightest nudge and they ran so farwith it. And there's a bunch of thesepeople in my chat right now. Here's onefrom earlier from void. Crazy how muchI've grown as a dev in just 5 months.Watched all your YouTube videos and yourall your Twitch past podcast stuff andI'm surprised at myself how well I codenow and what I find more valuablereading others code and understandingit. This message is not about me. Itmight seem like it is but it isn't. Ihappened to provide an environment wheresomeone like void could grow and dobetter. But I'm not the one who madethem better. I am just a tool that theyused in their process to get there. Thatis all their hard work. I'm just aperson creating these resources. Butwhat's really cool here is now I knowVoid isn't just an okay dev or a gooddev. He is probably already a great dev.And if he's not, he's going to be verysoon because he is motivated to improveand change. And a lot of people in hisposition weren't in that position untilsomeone around them pushed them to try alittle harder or rewarded them forsomething they didn't think that muchabout. Once you get addicted to thatfeeling, once you feel what it is toprogress and have more confidence andownership over the things you're doing,you either don't care or you getaddicted. The people who get addictedare very visibly addicted. That's what Iam here. And if you're that type, Idon't know if you can properlyassimilate into people who aren't. I,and this is again the thing I said atthe beginning, don't take my words asgospel here. I did this wrong. I am veryfortunate that I found this YouTubecareer that now pays way better than myjob at Twitch did. It took a while toget there, but most don't. I very wellcould have destroyed my career by notjust shutting up and letting things go.I would probably be a principal engineerat Amazon or Twitch now, making a lot ofmoney if I could just shut up and smilethrough things that were stupid and justship the thing I was told to. But Iwasn't capable. And the people whoaround me also weren't and just caredmore, are still people I am close withto this day, and I value them allimmensely. They are the reason that Iwas able to have the successful career Ihad because they would defend me. Theywould understand me. They would coach mewhen I was being stupid or aggressive ormy autism was causing me to spaz out onthings that didn't matter. And theysupported me when this stuff when ithurt and when it sucked. And thoseallies, those friendships, those peoplethat you know you can trust matter morethan any title or role or technology orfeature that you ship. Find thosepeople. And if you can't find anywhereyou are now, find somewhere that youcan. Because if they don't exist whereyou are, that's the truth. They don'texist where you are. And only one of twothings can happen. Either they make youno longer one of those people or youfind somewhere better. I don't knowwhich one's right for you, but I hopethis video helps you figure it out foryourself. What a rant. Until next time,peace nerds.",
    "summary": "The video explores the frustrations that can arise when a good engineer finds themselves in an environment that doesn't value or support their abilities. Triggered by a viewer's question about a demanding boss, the speaker reflects on his personal experiences at Twitch, particularly the contrasting environments he encountered. He emphasizes the importance of self-awareness regarding one's value to a company (bus factor), recognizing that being essential can be a double-edged sword. His initial team swap to the creator org exposed the toxic dynamic of being surrounded by people threatened by a fast, effective engineer, leading to conflict and hindering his contributions. He highlights that in some work environments, being a high-performing engineer can actively create enemies within your team.\n\nThe speaker advises viewers to stop doing work that doesn’t benefit their own career at the company, even when it hurts the product, as a key to thriving. He details a specific example where pushing back against a poorly conceived product change led to career repercussions, contrasting it with a colleague who was rewarded for shipping a poorly implemented feature that caused major issues. He identifies that a motivated person working on their own is a good dev, and a motivated person working within a motivated team, with people pushing them to be better, will turn into a great dev. This leads into the core message of finding supportive colleagues and mentors who share a drive for improvement. These allies provide invaluable support, guidance, and a sense of belonging.\n\nUltimately, the video argues that finding and cultivating these relationships is more important than titles, roles, or specific technologies. If such a supportive environment doesn't exist at your current workplace, the speaker urges viewers to seek it elsewhere, emphasizing that remaining in a non-supportive setting can either diminish your motivation or drive you to find a better fit. He acknowledges the potential financial security of \"shutting up\" and going along with things, but suggests that it will be ultimately unfulfilling. The video is therefore framed as a personal reflection and call to action, urging viewers to prioritize finding a supportive community where their skills and drive are valued."

    "transcript": "If you're trying to make anytransformational change to improve yourlife and you're not leveraging the powerof artificial intelligence, then thatmight be the critical error that iskeeping you stuck. With AI, we canfinally build systems that nudge peopletowards healthier, more fulfilling livesrather than stealing their time. Holdthat thought for a minute, but first I'mgoing to give you a bit of context andthen I promise to come back to explainwhere AI fits into the picture. I usedto be the most undisiplined person. Iwas skinny fat because I drank a lot ofalcohol and I ate out at restaurantsliterally every day. I was chronicallydepressed because I had endless negativethought loops. And I was financiallyinsecure because I developed spendinghabits based on the notion that a youngand successful person was supposed tohave a fancy car or go on expensivetrips and spend their money on nicethings. Despite this, I was alsoambitious. I aspired to eventually leavethe rat race and become an entrepreneur,to have the freedom to live in adifferent country and basically turn theworld into my playground and to be anall-around healthier, more fulfilledperson who lives in a state ofabundance. Fast forward to today, andthat's exactly what I did. I spent yearsexperimenting with differentphilosophies and mindsets. And overtime, I went from being very unhealthyto being in the best shape of my life. Iwent from being fully immersed in thecorporate rat race to becoming a soloentrepreneur. And I went from being tieddown to my home in Chicago to living inPortugal and having the flexibility tobe anywhere that I basically want at anytime that I wish. Of course, my life isnot perfect by any stretch of theimagination, but I can say that it isunquestionably better now than it wasbefore. I don't wake up on Mondaymornings resenting the fact that I haveto go into an office or to log into aremote job that I feel completelydisconnected from. I don't feel the sameFOMO or social pressures that a lot of30 or 40ome yearear-old mid-careerprofessionals experience. And I don'thave any major health concerns fromstress or being too sedentary or eatingthe standard American diet. To createthis life for myself, I had toaggressively eliminate the personalhabits that were holding me back frombuilding a lifestyle that was morealigned with what I actually wanted.It's more important to prevent badhabits than to cultivate good ones. Sothrough this entire experience ofdesigning my lifestyle, I learned thatthe quickest pathway to solving mostproblems in life is not necessarily bydoing more, but it's actually by doingless. The most transformational changesin your life will come from aggressivelyremoving the self-destructive habits.So, if you find yourself trying totransform any area of your life, butfeel stuck or as if you keep running incircles but not gaining any traction,it's probably because you haven't doneenough to address the habits that aremisaligned with your goals.Unfortunately, squashing bad habits ismuch easier said than done. But the goodnews is that it's not only possible, butalso with the help of AI, we can cutthrough the noise and get straight tothe point with actionable informationthat will help you to change your lifeso fast that people will think that youbasically used a cheat code. And in away, you kind of did. Now, I believe inthe power of systems and process. Sowhenever I do anything to great success,I always look backwards at what workedand what didn't and I create a systemthat I can follow to replicate thatsuccess in the future. And that's whatI'll be sharing with you today in thisvideo. So if you continue watching, thenyou'll not only learn exactly how I useartificial intelligence to transform mylife by overcoming self-destructivehabits, but you'll also get an AIworkflow that you can use to target andkill habits that are holding you backfrom radically transforming your ownlife. Honestly, I used to keep thesethings to myself. But now that I spendthe time to write these video scriptsand make these videos, I want you tosteal my formula. If you don't have astructured and proven system in placefor breaking bad habits, then there's noneed to reinvent the wheel. You canliterally just copy off of me and saveyourself a lot of time and energy in theprocess. So, with that said, killing badhabits is the lowest hanging fruit onthe problem tree. It's the mostaccessible option that both can beimplemented immediately and is fullywithin your control. So for any majorlife transformation, whether it'sbecoming financially independent,becoming healthier, becoming moreattractive to improve your dating life,you will get the highest return on yourenergy investment by focusing on theprocess of elimination before you addnew layers of complexity to your life.Elimination is the highest form ofmastery. The best way to improve yourlife is to stop doing what is making itworse. Eliminating yourcounterproductive habits is the mostimportant and highest impact thing thatyou can do to solve whatever lifeproblem that you have today. I think asimple analogy for this is those whowant to achieve financial freedom.Before you start putting energy intomaking more money, first you need toeliminate poor spending habits. But whatmost people do is hustle to make morewhile never addressing thecounterproductive habit of impulsivelyspending beyond their means. And so weend up in a reality where half of allAmericans making over $100,000 a yearand onethird of all Americans makingover $200,000 a year are still livingpaycheck to paycheck. This is becausethey've overlooked the part wherethey're supposed to fix their excessivespending first before increasing theirearning. And the result is that evenmany high earners don't build wealth orat least not the life-changing wealththat unlocks a life of freedom andautonomy. And the same goes for so manyother aspects of life. You can't outexercise the habit of eating a bad diet.You'll never see transformationalfitness results if you try to do it thisway. The fastest way to cure performanceissues in the bedroom, which anuncomfortably high number of men intheir 30s and 40s are experiencing, isto kill the habit of watching adultentertainment and scrolling on socialmedia, where beauty standards arethrough the roof. The quickest path togeographic autonomy, where you can liveor travel anywhere at any time, lies ineliminating the habit of accumulatingthings that keep you tied to onelocation. I think that you get the pointhere. So, I won't continue to drive ithome. But when I started coaching peoplein their transformation journeys, what Iquickly realized is that most peoplereally struggle to break out of theirbad habits, they end up trying to make aseismic shift in their lives, but withlimited success because they didn'treally zero in on managing their olderself-destructive habits. And so thereason why you might struggle to createthe change in your life that you want islikely because you're focusing on allthe other things, but you haven't fullybroken the habits that are actuallypreventing you from moving forward. Now,I don't think that it's particularlyuseful to just tell someone that theyneed to break bad habits. If it werethat easy, then everyone would do it.But you can make doing such infinitelyeasier for yourself rather thanapproaching it haphazardly. If you makethe time and energy investment intobuilding a structured, a methodical, andan intentional system that wires yourbrain to be reflexively averse to theself-destructive habits that are holdingyou back. I call this the anti-desireprotocol. And fortunately, with the helpof AI, it's easier than ever to create asystem for rewiring the brain andbuilding anti-desires that will make youintuitively avoid self-destructivehabits. The same algorithms that addictus can also help us evolve if we usethem consciously. Now, I like to keepthings simple. I don't buy a milliondifferent productivity tools. I like tobe resourceful and stick to the basics.So, for this, I just use a paid versionof Chat GPT along with a basicscheduling app. Now, you may notice herethat I'm using a tool called Cerebrum X,which is a customized AI coach poweredby ChatGpt. and it's something that I'vebeen working on for the past few months.And I use it personally for all of myself-development work. So, the responsesthat you'll see here are much morepointed than the generic responses thatyou'll get from the standard chat GPT.And if you'd also like to get the higherquality and more refined responses thatyou see me demonstrate in this video,then I did just make the Cerebrum XAccelerator publicly available for thosewho want to explore that option. So,first things first, I use AI to craft myanti-vision, my vision, and my values. Ihave mentioned many times in previousvideos that before you can transformyour life, you need to first know thedirection that you want to take yourlife. And you do this through creatingan anti- vision and then taking theopposite of your anti- vision to produceyour vision and then establishing yourcore values around that vision. So Istart out by instructing AI to help medo this. Now you could create your ownprompt if you like, but I already didthe work for you. So you can just usethe prompt that I provided here. Andwhat this does is it directs me tocreate a recurring calendar event with alink to this chat that I can referencefor future use, which is reallyimportant because building a system isnot something that's done in a day. Sousing this process, it'll actually takeseveral days of interacting with AIbefore it starts to output actionableinformation. So, once I create myrecurring calendar event, I'll begin my7-day journaling process, which collectsvaluable information from me so that itcan create a customized plan that'sspecific to my needs. I do this over 7days because it's quite difficult tocome up with all of the important andpersonal information all at once. So,over the course of days, my mood mightfluctuate and I might be in differentstates of mind at different times and ondifferent days. So after 7 days ofjournaling through this AI interface, Iautomatically get a summary of my anti-vision, my vision, and my values, whichyou can see here. FYI, for this demo,I'm using a dummy scenario beingphysically and mentally healthier. Sothis is what you are looking at on thescreen right here. Now, this isobviously not the final cut. AI is justa tool and therefore it cannotcompletely replace my own thinking. So,I'm going to read through this outputand I'm going to fine-tune it from hereand I'm going to manually make changesto make sure that it is fully aligned.And once I feel good about that, I moveon to the second step, which is I use AIto help me zero in on theself-destructive habits that are mostout of sync with my vision. Most of ushave plenty of bad habits that we knowthat we should work on. But staying trueto Paro's principle, I direct all of myenergy to the few habits that are thebiggest drivers towards my anti- vision,thus holding me back from living myideal life. The majority of yourproblems come from a minority of yourhabits. If you want to change your lifefast, find the 20% of your behaviorcausing 80% of your problems andeliminate it. Now, I do this throughcontinued journaling to feed chat GPTmore information that will help me toquickly hone in on the habits that aremost likely to have the mosttransformational impact if I dosuccessfully eliminate them from mylife. To do that, I use this promptwhich gives the artificial intelligenceinstructions to provide me with a fewjournal entries over the course of 4days and then to output a list ofcounterproductive habits along with aprioritization and a ranking of the topthree most self-destructive habits thatI should focus my energy on. Now thebenefit here is that artificialintelligence can pick up on the patternsthat we are not privy to as humans andit can relate my own personal situationto the collective experiences of thepopulation and draw insights that I'munable to produce in isolation. So wewant to take advantage of that fact andthat is what is happening here. Now,just as I've mentioned before, I'llrefine this list if I need to. And thenonce I feel good about what I have here,I'll move on to the next step, which isthat I use AI to connect myself-destructive habits to my anti-vision. In my experience, the fastestway for me to build an anti-desiretowards something is to change the waythat my brain processes informationaround that thing. What you read, watch,and listen to will determine what youthink about. And what you think aboutdetermines who you become. and youbecome the books you read, the peopleyou listen to, the media you consume. Tointentionally change the way that mybrain processes information, and toeffectively reprogram my brain, I needto immerse myself in the rightinformation environment. And with enoughtime consciously consuming informationthat directly connects my bad habits tomy anti- vision, my brain begins tobuild a more vivid understanding of theconsequences of those habits. So theconsequences become much more real.Thus, I begin to build an anti-desirearound those activities. I can spendages trying to curate the optimalinformation environment for myself. Butfortunately, because I've provided AIwith enough information, I can save alot of time by prompting it to instantlycreate an information program based onmy specific situation. And so I use thisprompt here to do so. And as you cansee, this gives me an arsenal ofinformation in different formats that Ican fully immerse myself in to alter myreality and my behaviors in a way thatmakes me averse to self-destructivehabits. So, I can follow this exactprogram or I can tailor it a bit, butnow I have a concrete foundation forreceiving the information inputsnecessary to make tangible change in mylife. And then lastly, I use AI tocreate an automated system. So at thispoint, I've done the work to figure outmy anti-vision, my vision, my values.I've identified my highest impactself-destructive habits. I've curated myinformation diet to build an anti-desirearound those bad habits. And now allthat's left is to pull everythingtogether into a system. Systems allowordinary people to achieve extraordinaryresults. At the end of the day, allchange comes through actions and theexperience that comes from thoseactions. But the system is what gives methe structure, the repetition, and theconsistency necessary to carry out thedaily actions that will help me torewire my brain and build thoseanti-desires one neuro connection at atime. So, I provide artificialintelligence with instructions to layout a workable system that I can follow.And you can see the prompt here that Iuse. And this gives me a suggestedformat that I can build from instead ofoperating haphazardly with no plan or nostructure. And as you can see here, it'sliterally telling me what to do everyday and when to do it. It's giving mesome things that I can do whenever Icome across something that triggers theurge to engage in the bad habit as wellas a syllabus of sorts for consuming theresources that I previously identifiedas part of my information immersionprogram. And so with enough time offollowing a system, a critical mass ofneural connections in my brain areeither created or altered, resulting inmy brain being physically rewired to nolonger engage in the bad habit thatremoves me farther away from my ideallife. So, I have said it before. If youare trying to fundamentally change yourlife and you're trying to do it fast, sofast in fact that people think that youcheated, then you need to focus ongetting control over yourself-destructive habits to drive seriousand lasting change. And if you happen tobe one of the many people who approachit without any structure or plan, thenthere's no need to reinvent the wheel.You can literally just copy my formula,create your own prompts or use the onesthat I provided you with in this video,plug it into AI, create your anti-vision, your vision, your values, andthen let it create a customtailoredsystem specifically for you. And byhaving a system, you're far more likelyto be successful in changing your lifebecause most people are not veryintentional with how they do things. So,you'll be operating on a completelydifferent frequency than most, whichmeans you'll likely see above averageresults compared to the amount of effortthat you put in. Now, if you want a copyand paste version of my prompts alongwith exclusive access to the Cerebrum XAccelerator that I used in this video,then you can find a link to it in thedescription below. And as always, ifyou're ready to start seriously makingmoves, then pick up a copy of theself-reinvention cheat code, which is afueled manual that will guide youthrough a process of structuring a60-day transformation in any area ofyour life. So, not only will you breakbad habits, but you'll also build goodhabits for a stronger body, a sharpermind, and a more fulfilling life, oranything else that you want to radicallyimprove for yourself. You can also finda link to that in the description below.And that's everything that I have foryou today, guys. Guys, I hope that youenjoyed the message and until next time,always remember to get up, get out, andget after it.",
    "summary": "This YouTube video outlines a method for leveraging AI to rewire your brain and eliminate self-destructive habits. The speaker shares his personal transformation from an unhealthy and unfulfilled lifestyle to a more liberated and purposeful existence, emphasizing the critical role of eliminating bad habits as the foundation for positive change. He argues that most people struggle with transformation because they focus on adding new positive habits without addressing the underlying negative ones that hold them back. He introduces his \"anti-desire protocol,\" which utilizes AI to build aversion to these undesirable behaviors, making them easier to avoid.\n\nThe core of his method involves a four-step process using AI tools like ChatGPT (or his custom version, Cerebrum X): 1) crafting an anti-vision, vision, and values statement to define the desired direction; 2) identifying and prioritizing the most impactful self-destructive habits through journaling and AI analysis; 3) connecting these habits to the anti-vision by curating an \"information immersion program\" of articles, videos, and other media that highlight the negative consequences; and 4) creating an automated system with daily actions and reminders to reinforce the anti-desire and rewire the brain through repetition and consistency. The video emphasizes that the same algorithms used to create addictive behaviors can be harnessed to break them, and provides prompts that can be used with AI to create custom-tailored system. By creating a structured system, people are more likely to see above average results compared to the amount of effort that they put in."

Isn't thatjust a wrapper over the server that Icould put in my closet? Why would I useLinux? Isn't that just a wrap? You getthe idea. Depending on where you live,in what layer in the stack you exist,everything starts to look like a rapper.This isn't a new thing. I'm not suddenlyspitting like two chains out herebecause the world's changing. The reasonthat everything's a rapper is because weimprove technology over time. I can'tbelieve I have to make this video, but Ifeel like it's become necessary becausepeople seem to think rappers are bad andexamples of software not improving whenin reality almost every majorimprovement we've seen to software overthe last like 30 plus years has in manyways just been a rapper. So, if you wantto watch me defend Java, talk onAWS, and explain in detail why I thinkT3 Chat is a better product than OpenAI,then sit around because we have to paysome bills really quick. Recently, I'veloved building one-off apps quickly withtools like Bolt, Vzero, and Lovable, butthere's a couple things they don't doright. One in particular they all seemto struggle a lot with is Oth. It'sweirdly easy to build an applicationfrom scratch, and it's weirdly hard tojust get a sign-in button working,unless you're using today's sponsor,Clerk. Clerk is still the easiest way toget off set up properly without havingto worry about managing it, deployingit, and keeping it up to date andclogging up your user table. Whether ornot you end up using Clerk, take my wordfor it. The sooner you can get the usertable out of your database and manageoff in a different service or microsservice of some form, the better. It hasmade my life so much easier, and I neverthought that would be the case. Butthat's far from the only thing Clerkdoes that makes my life easier. the factthey have a whole component librarybuilt in. So you can just have good UIfor everything from the sign-in buttonto the actual user profile stuff tomanaging everything from orgs to invitesfor the users of your stuff. It's reallygood. Seriously though, if you're usingNex.js and you don't have off set up, Icannot make a better recommendation thanClerk. It's comically easy. You installa package. You pull clerk middlewareinto the middleware TS file. You justexport default clerk middleware. Throwin this config if you want to skip otherthings you don't want to have validated.You hop into your layouts. You wrap yourapp with the clerk provider. Then youjust throw the sign in and sign upbuttons wherever you want to use them.And if you have things you only want torender when signed in, wrap them in thesignedin component. If you have thingsyou only want to render on signed out,wrap them in the signed out component.And that user button, that's the fancylittle menu that when you click has allthe information for the user so theycould sign out, see what email addressthey're using, configure their profile,all that just built in. For those ofyall with enterprise cases, they justremoved all of the SSO fees. You know,the famous SSO attacks, the wall ofshame, making fun of all the companiesthat charge way too much when you turnon SSO. They don't. And they're an offcompany. They're the one that you wouldexpect to have doing that. Generallyspeaking, their pricing is super fair,too. especially when you consider thefact that they don't count people whoonly signed in once and then didn't comeback 24 hours later against your monthlyactive users. So, you never have toworry about a huge spike in trafficwhere nobody converts costing you abunch of money because those users justdon't count towards your numbers. It'sgreat. It's such a nice thing and I wishmore companies would do stuff like this.It's really, really nice. If you need O,check them out today atsoyb.link/clerk. This is one of thosevideos that I'm going to get in troublefor and I don't care because this is animportant take y'all need to hear. Ineed to be fully transparent. There'sone particular reason this is coming up.T3 Chat, in case you're somehow herewithout knowing, I'd be impressed. T3Chat is an AI chat app that I builtbecause I was not happy with theexisting ones. Not that the models werebad. Claude and most of the stuff goingon at OpenAI, in particular, the Oermodels are awesome. The problem was thattheir UIs aren't very good. Chances areI've already put out the video where Iroast all of their UIs by now. If not,keep an eye out for it. The point isthat I wasn't happy with this layer. Theimportant thing to understand is thatthe website is a wrapper. The chat GPTsite, chatgbt.com, is a wrapper for allthe different AI models that OpenAI putsout. My layer with T3 chat is adifferent wrapper for all of thosethings. We're all wrapping the model andits behaviors. The quality of theserappers is what matters. And T3 Chat isnot the first time I have written one ofthese rappers. If we go to my company,my startup Ping's homepage here, we havefour things here. We have T3 chat, whichis a wrapper of all of these LLMs. Wehave upload thing, which is kind of awrapper of S3 and R2 and a bunch ofother hybrid things that we're doing. Wehave P thing, which is a wrapper of acouple different background removalservices for image management, as wellas, funny enough, a wrap around uploadthing, and ping.gg, which is a wrapperaround a handful of WebRTC providers toprovide really highquality HD videocalls for creators to do livecollaboration. All of these tools arerappers, but I would challenge you toshow me any tool that isn't because inthe end, everything is kind of awrapper. If we go all the way down tothe lowest levels in ourcomputers, they'll look something likethis. But that's not the lowest you cango because each of these ones and zerosrepresents silicon that has specificvalues in it depending on whether or notit is in an on state. So we representthis by wrapping it with binary thatshows the value that exists in theprocessor. We then invented a languageto interface with this called assembly.Assembly is a syntax for us to accessthe values and the registers and all thethings as they are defined in our devicein our memory in our systems. Imagine ifwhen C came out you were to respond, whywould I ever use C? Isn't that just acrappy wrapper for assembly? I shouldjust write the assembly code myself. Andif you said that, you would either bethe developer of Roller Coaster Tycoon,the developer of FFmpeg, orwrong. Yeah, the benefit of C isn't justthat it's easier to write than assembly.Actually goes a bit further. The benefitof C is that there wasn't just oneassembly. There was MIPS. There was alsoother assemblies like x86 assembly ornowadays we have ARM assembly and thebenefit that we all forget about when wepretend C doesn't need to exist is thathaving one layer like C allows us tohave this one layer support all sorts ofdifferent things at the same time. Wehave this one giant shared abstractionthat is just a wrapper, but it's just awrapper for ARM assembly as well as forMIPS as well as for x86. This wrapper isvaluable both because it meaningfullyimproves the developer experience wehave working in the code because thecode is easier to read, easier to write,easier to review, easier to maintain.And it means we have a simpler portablelayer that we can use to port things todifferent assembly types. That is amassive win. I don't care how good youare at writing assembly. Having a sharedlanguage like this that works across allthese different platforms is so valuablethat Java only existed to push it evenfurther. The goal of Java was to be anabstraction that let you run the samecode and have the same applicationexperience on top of things that wereeven more unalike than we have here,like the weird obtuse platforms forBlackberry or for other crappysmartphones back in the day forembedding things into your web pages.Java was incredible for having code thatyou could write, not even have torecompile. Because here at the veryleast with C now I have to take my code,my C code and recompile it to spit outassembly that is compatible for all ofthese different platforms. Java as ahigher level abstraction can just targetC effectively because C has had aruntime written in it for Java for allthe different places you might want toput it. So as long as there's a Javaruntime for the platform you'retargeting, you don't even need tocompile. You just throw the code over tothat runtime and it handles it. And thatis magical. And the magic isn't justbecause the code works in multipleplaces only writing it once. The magicis you can swap out these abstractions.We have here the Java runtime. The Javaruntime is pretty good. It's not great,but it is especially for its time, itwas incredible. But there havebeen a lot of developments to makefaster Java runtimes. One of the biggestinnovations in the Java world was Growl,which is a faster runtime that will workgreat with your Java code. And you cankind of just swap out your runtime toGrowl or whatever other changes happenin the runtime layer to make your codebetter, faster, more portable, and more.Since this abstraction exists, there's alot of things you can do in thatabstract layer that allow for the placethat your user's code lives to bebetter. And that's awesome because thisabstraction makes Java, at leasttheoretically, easier to write. We hadto learn a lot of lessons. But it alsomeans this layer can have improvementsthat don't require you to change eitherside that allow for both sides to seemeaningful wins. And this goes for lotsof technologies. This also goes forReact, for example. React Native is asyntax that feels and works just likeReact, but it has to have a reallycomplex binding layer to those nativebehaviors. That binding layer haschanged significantly over the last 10years and is now at the point where it'sway faster. And for the most part, youcan just bump the version of your ReactNative package and get these massiveperformance wins. You can make thecounter argument that those things areonly necessary because the performancewasn't ideal in the first place. But Iwould say, yeah, there's nothing fasterthan an app that doesn't exist becauseit's so much harder to write.So now let's bring this over to whatwe're actually here to talk about whichis T3 chat. T3 chat is an abstractionover the Verscell AI SDK which is anabstraction over the open AI SDKstandard which is about as standard asS3's API. And if you think S3's API isstandard, go try to build your ownupload thing on something else. Ipromise you it's not standard. It'sstandard in the most vague sense atbest. But because we have the open AISDK standard, that is what Verscell's AISDK is building on top of any AILMprovider can just support that OpenAIstandard. like I don't know, OpenAIobviously does, but also you guys mighthave heard of a company calledEnthropic or maybe if you're reallytuned in, DeepSeek or if you hang outhere enough, Grock with a Q, not a K.There's a difference. What's cool hereis because we are operating through theVerselli SDK as our abstraction layer.We now have a single syntax, a singleway of working with these providers thatallows for us to support all of them,which we do. When I say we support allthe models, I pretty much mean it. Bythe time this video comes out, theremight be more. There almost certainlywill be knowing how our schedule isright now. But all of these models canbe supported because we have anabstraction on top. Are we just wrappingall of these things? Kind of. Yeah. Butby being a wrapper around the rightthing, we can now provide a betterexperience, more portability, and mostimportantly, more options for our users.It is not a bad thing to be a wrapper.One more fun example, the one everybodyused originally to on us for notknowing what we're doing. Upload thing.Upload thing is quite the wrapperbecause upload thing is a file storagesolution. And the upload thing packagedoesn't wrap S3. It wraps the uploadthing infra. The upload thing infra ispretty complex. We have our own ingestand our ingest server has to handle alot of different things. It has to wrapour database layer, keep that up todate. It has to handle the files comingin, keep that in a local state, usuallythrough something like Reddus, just incase the user has issues uploading. Ithas to stop and restart, they loseinternet, any of those types of issues.There's a lot of them. They suck. Thisnow has to be served somewhere. And yes,we are serving them by default throughS3. But S3 is not the best place foryour files a lot of the time. If yourfiles are being accessed often enough,the egress costs on S3 are unbelievablyhigh. So we keep some files when theyhit certain thresholds on Cloudflare R2.If we didn't have an abstraction likeupload thing, it would be basicallyimpossible for us to do the right thingon a per file basis like we can rightnow. If you were to just use S3directly, it would cost you more moneyif you're doing actual traffic becauseserving those files directly through S3is expensive. And if you're not, thenyou yourself are wrapping S3 with yourown cloud formation calls, your ownhandling of that cache layer. You can'tjust hit S3. If you're not usingCloudFront or some other cache in front,you're screwed. But if you let us handlethat, not only are you not screwed andwe'll handle it for you, we'll alsohandle optimizations that you can'twithout leaving the cloud. You'd have toleave S3 and leave AWS if you wanted toreally minmax your cost, performance,and overall characteristics of your filesystem. R2 is slower. R2 is moreexpensive to hold your files, but it isa lot cheaper to serve them once they'rebeing held. So optimizing where thefiles go depending on thecharacteristics of how they're beingaccessed is an abstraction that you canonly do as a wrapper. Being a wrapper isenabling us to do things that youcouldn't if you weren't. So not only iswrapping your stuff better because ofthe flexibility of where you can go withit after ability to change and makechanges, it also enables powerfulbehaviors that you wouldn't be able tootherwise. The same way that Java isable to have its code run in multipleenvironments with no changes. In thesame way that T3 chat lets us havedifferent model providers all supportedwithout changes. Upload thing allows usto put our files in the most optimalplaces. Say it with me chat. Withoutchanges. Abstractions aregood. Wrappers are what power all of thetools and technologies we use. If youwere to look at a stack trace and seejust how deep any program you're usinggoes in terms of the different things itis wrapping, you'd realize that makingfun of web devs for wrapping browserstandards with better APIs is very verysilly because the average package you'reusing in something like Rust is wrapping15 plus layers of crap going all the waydown to the native layer. And thesewrappers are good. It is an awesomething that the tools we use today are sowell packaged and bundled and wrappedthat for the most part devs don't haveto go down to these lower levelsanymore. As tools like Java get better,the need for tools that are more complexgoes down. And what you'll see over timeis as these abstractions get better andbetter, you have to care about less andless. It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.doesn't mean we can't optimize it incertain ways, but there has been noinnovation in the bottom section here ina very long time. There has not been ameaningful innovation in how we processassembly code and the way that we storebinary values. We might have quantumsomeday, probably not, but someday. Weeffectively aren't innovating at thatlayer anymore. The next layer up with C,we are innovating some amount with toolslike Rust. And it's very good to seethat because it needs the innovation.But up until recently, that layer wasn'teven being touched. And we were kind ofliving in this runtime world where thatwas the level of abstraction that we areworking in and fighting with andinnovating around every day. And that'snot a bad thing. We didn't do thisbecause we're terrible, evil devs thatare so stupid that we don't want tolearn C. We did this because working inthis abstraction layer is moreproductive. There are so many greatengineers that built the tools that livein this lower area that don't work inthem anymore, that have moved up thestack because they care more aboutshipping good software than they careabout flexing the fact that they knowthe difference between NIPS assembly andx86 assembly. Good devs don't fight tolive in a specific box forever. Gooddevs move up and down depending on wherethey need to be for the thing they'retrying to build. The devs who say youshould live here are just as bad as thedevs who say you should live here. Youshould go where makes sense for thething that you're doing. And for mostpeople, building applications that areuserfacing, living inside of C makes nosense at all. Which is why, for betteror worse, there are now a lot of devsthat can't see below this level. Do Ithink that's bad? Kind of. It'd be niceif more devs understood how deep thesethings go, so they can understand whycertain things do or don't work. and whythey should or shouldn't do things incertain ways, but you should run intothose problems. And if you're notrunning into those problems, then doesit really matter how well you know thethings underneath? Abstractions aregood. Rappers are great. And if you'rethinking about this in business terms,something like T3 chat has a muchstickier experience than OpenAI orAnthropic because they still have tobuild all of this themselves. If we'relooking at the OpenAI site, the OpenAIsite is wrapping their models, but it'swrapping them in a much smaller way.What you end up with is something likethis. And now each of these is going tohave to wrap it in its own special waybecause the wrapper isn't just like athing we did for fun. A rapper is anecessary abstraction to make theseparts work properly. And it's silly tolook at this and say, \"Yeah, you're justselling a rapper. You should use a realservice likechatgpt.com. It's the exact samething. I'll never understand the it'sjust a rapper because depending on whenyou asked and where you live, C was justa rapper, too. And now people say, whyare you just using all those rappers?You could write that in C. Or evenfunnier, why are you using somethinglike Cotlin? You could just write theJava yourself. No. The reason theserappers exist are because we need thingsthat the native layers aren't providingand we want abstractions so we don'thave to rely on any specific nativelayer. Abstractions are good. Rappersare good. Stop complaining about theseif you don't understand them. And if youhave examples of rappers that are bad,let me know because from my experience,it's not that rapping was bad, it's thatthe developers who built the rapper werebad or had a bad incentive or goal whenthey wrote it. For the most part,rappers represent meaningfulimprovements in the developer experiencethat we have every day. And we shouldn'ttalk on them like the word rapperis somehow magically just a bad word.I've never understood it. I never will.It's rappers all the way down. The theonly reason you can about rappersis because you picked somewhere to drawa line and you drew that line and said,\"Okay, everything above this line is acrappy rapper. Everything below thisline is real. But when you draw thatline, you're implicitly saying C isn't arapper, but Javais. It's just nonsense. It's justabsolute nonsense. I don't care. T3 chatis a very successful service because webuilt a good wrapper for the sets oftools, technologies, and models thatexist. upload things a good servicebecause we are wrapping AWS3 and R2 inways that are much easier to digest,integrate, maintain, and scale. Theserappers are awesome and I build them fora reason. They solve real problems. AndI would love for somebody to show mealternatives or competing services thataren't similar rappers with lessflexibility because the rappers that Ibuild are better, more flexible ways tosolve real problems that I and othershave. As Little Finger just said here,there can't be bad rappers, but they arenot bad because they are rappers.They're bad because they do not workwell. Yes, people you talk to woulddefine a rapper that provides noadditional abstraction. I wouldchallenge those people to show me asingle rapper that that is the case for.Because if that is how they're using theterm rapper, they're just using the termrapper as an abstraction that I don'tunderstand. Because if you can't see thevalue in why someone would wrapsomething a certain way, then it's notfor you. Just move on. If the onlyargument you have against something isthat it is a rapper, you arecomplimenting the thing because youcouldn't find anything else wrong withit. If the problem with the tool is thatit's just a rapper, it's not a problem.It just means you don't understand thething. If you want to aboutservices like T3 Chatter Upload thing orthe many similar rappers that manyothers have made, you should figure outhow to give actual constructivecomplaints because saying it's just arapper is saying you don't understandit. And I am so tired of this complaintthat now y'all had to listen to mecomplain about it for however long wejust did. The difference between me andthose people is that I could actuallyconcretely form a thought about what iswrong with those people. And what'swrong with them is their brain isn'tfully developed. I have nothing else tosay about these people. They can go backto polishing their Arch Linux configsand not ever shipping software because Iknow the exact type of person who makesthese complaints and they are not realdevelopers. And if you're dealing withone of those people complaining aboutsome rapper that they don't want to use,send them this video and make sure theyknow this end part is for them. Okay,that's all I have and until next time,keep wrapping software.",
    "summary": "This video addresses the common criticism that many software tools are \"just wrappers\" and argues that this is not inherently a bad thing. The creator contends that most technological advancements involve wrapping existing technologies with layers of abstraction to improve developer experience, portability, and functionality. He uses examples like C, Java, and React Native to illustrate how these wrappers provide shared abstractions, simplified code, and cross-platform compatibility. The video emphasizes that these layers of abstraction are vital for making the underlying technologies more accessible and efficient for a wider range of developers.\n\nThe creator specifically highlights T3 Chat and Upload Thing as examples of \"wrappers\" built by his company that provide significant value. T3 Chat wraps AI models from various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) offering a better user interface and more options. Upload Thing, a file storage solution, wraps AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2, optimizing file placement based on access patterns to minimize costs and maximize performance. He clarifies that being a \"wrapper\" enables powerful behaviors and flexibility that wouldn't be possible otherwise, comparing the criticism to saying C is \"just a wrapper\" over assembly.\n\nThe core message is that abstractions and wrappers are fundamental to software development, enabling developers to focus on higher-level tasks and build complex applications more efficiently. Dismissing a tool as \"just a wrapper\" demonstrates a lack of understanding of its value and the improvements it offers. The speaker further states that good developers move up and down the stack depending on the problem, while bad developers cling to lower levels out of some false sense of superiority. Finally, the creator encourages developers to embrace well-designed wrappers and abstractions as they represent meaningful improvements in the development process."

It'skind of just like batshit insane that weare living in this world. Uh, but thereis a great exercise. I I can't stopthinking about this. I forgot who sentit. I'll give you the uh the basics ofit. Okay, so there's this tweet I sawand effectively they said somethingalong the lines of we spent like fivehours trying to get all these playbuttons to stop playing video on somecertain action throughout the website.And then a senior engineer just simplythrew in just a very simple for loop andthat's all you really needed to do. Andit was just this massive forgetting thatJavaScript just has a whole bunch ofstuff that's available and you can justdo that. You can just write code. I feelso dumb. There you go. I feel so dumb.

It's actually quite simple.It's really not that hard to maintain.Maybe you don't need an architectureastronaut just to simply turn off allthe audio. Maybe you should just turnoff the audio. You know what I mean?maybe just do the thing as opposed totrying to make the entire system that'snot designed to do this thing to do thething. Yeah. And of course, 6 monthslater, why is audio randomly muting onthe site? Sure, you will find that out.It's actually really not that hard tofigure those things out, but you cannottell me that hours upon hours of comingup with the perfect architecture all thetime is worth that maybe potentialfuture that you might have to debugsomething.

True. Thereshould be some amount of money I couldpay to slap somebody. Like, why can't wehave why can't we solve this with LLMs?Well, if your HTML is so great, why notjust write everything in assembly, huh?Wow, look at you. So clever littleprick. Did you come up with that one allby yourself? Writing web pages inassembly is like using a [ __ ] scalpelto slice your overcooked steak. Sure,it'll get the job done, but you're goingto look like a complete [ __ ] whileyou're doing or while you're at it. HTMLjust works, you absolute tool. It's justbeen the backbone of the web since AlGore flipped the switch. That's a prettyfunny call back and still we'll be therelong after your trendy framework isrotting in a GitHub graveyard. Oh myGitHub. So take your smartass logic andshove it. HL's king and you're just apeasant with a keyboard. Al Gorecatching strays. No, Al Gore said heinvented the internet. So I mean comeon. And rockets. HML lends a crutch toyour [ __ ] JS. Did you know that whenyou slap an ID on your HTML element,HTML doesn't just sit there like a lazy[ __ ] It actually creates a [ __ ]variable in JavaScript for you. By theway, I forgot this and like 6 months agoI rediscovered this like fun littletidbit cuz I haven't program I haven'traw dogged JavaScript in a while and Iwas like, \"Oh yeah, it does do that.\"Huh. It's true. It does do that. Yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, it does that. Iforgot. Yeah, you heard me, you cluelessbastard. You don't even have to lift afinger. Hml's out there doing the heavylifting while your JS is still trying tofigure out how to tie itsshoes. Now go try it. Open the consoleand type I am doofus. Boom. Yes, youare. Yes, you are. Okay, got me.It I've been had. And boom, there it is.You ungrateful [ __ ] Hmail just handedyou a variable on a silver platter andyou didn't even have to beg for it. Thisis basic [ __ ] and you don't even knowthis. Congrats. You're officially dumberthan a bag of rocks. This is HML flexingits muscles, showing you it's not somekind of static [ __ ] It's dynamic. It'spowerful and it's been carrying yoursorry ass since day one. Meanwhile, yourJS is out here acting like it's the starof the show when really it's just ridingHTML's coattails like a cheap date. So,next time you're jerking off to yourfancy JS frameworks, remember HTML isthe one doing the real work and has beenlaughing at your over complicated[ __ ] Words ofwisdom. Are you guys ready for somewords of wisdom now? Are you ready forsome words of wisdom? Also, I would justlike to say I don't think web componentsare that bad. It's kind of, let's see,it's the kind of page that makes youwant to weep tears of joy and throw youroverpriced JavaScript framework out thewindow. It's the kind of page that makesyou want to quit your job and become afull-time HTML evangelist. It's the kindof page that makes you want to start acult dedicated to the worship of HTML.It's the kind of page that makes youwant to write a love letter to HTML andsend it to the HTML gods. It's the kindof page that makes you want to build ashrine to HTML in your living room andinvite all of your friends over for acandle lit HTML worship worship session.It's the kind of page that makes youwant to start a YouTube channeldedicated to HTML tutorials and rants.It's the kind of page that makes youwant to write a book about HTML andself-publish it on Amazon. It's the kindof page that makes you want to start aTik Tok account dedicated to HTML andpost daily HTML dance videos. It's thekind of page that makes you want tostart a LinkedIn account dedicated toHTML and connect with other HTMLprofessionals. Just [ __ ] useHTML. Just [ __ ] use HTML. All rightsreserved. Your framework loving losers.Good take. I'd subscribe to his plain fink text email newsletter.It'strue. It's true. It's true. It's true.If you're still using frameworks, atleast uh have the decency to slap anerror tracker nice uh on that messearly. Your app's going to crash andburn anyways, even if it's raw HTML. Butas might as well watch it unfolds. Nice.Is this is this like the greatest adever created? A lightweight self-hostedSentry alternative without asubscription. Oh, that's funny.

    "summary": "This YouTube video, titled \"JUST USE HTML,\" is a profanity-laden, satirical rant advocating for the simplicity and effectiveness of plain HTML in web development. The speaker expresses frustration with the modern web development landscape, characterized by bloated JavaScript frameworks and over-engineering, where megabytes of code are often required for simple tasks. He argues that developers often overcomplicate projects, opting for complex frameworks when basic HTML could suffice. The video uses exaggerated examples of engineers struggling with complex architectures when simple solutions like a for loop could solve the problem efficiently.\n\nThe video highlights the benefits of HTML: it's fast, reliable, universally known, and doesn't require constant updates or complex deployment processes. The speaker mocks the reliance on frameworks, comparing them to overpriced accessories carrying the same basic content as a simple plastic bag (HTML). He showcases HTML's capabilities, including buttons, interactive elements, forms, and basic styling, demonstrating that many common website features can be achieved without JavaScript frameworks. He sarcastically rebuts common counterarguments, such as the suggestion to write everything in assembly, and points out the often-overlooked feature where HTML element IDs automatically create JavaScript variables.\n\nUltimately, the video encourages developers to reconsider their reliance on complex frameworks and to appreciate the power and simplicity of HTML. It's a call to avoid unnecessary over-engineering and to choose the most straightforward solution, even if it means using \"old-fashioned\" HTML. While delivered with excessive profanity and satire, the core message is a valuable reminder of the efficiency and reliability of HTML, and a critique of the modern web's tendency toward unnecessary complexity."

    "transcript": "Silicon Valley is truly[Music]special. This small region in NorthernCalifornia, it birthed silicon chips andthe semiconductor industry, which thenpaved the way for the entire massproduction of electronic devices. Thencame Apple's personal computers andsmartphones, Google's search engine andonline empire, Facebook's social mediarevolution, and Tesla's electric cars,not to mention breakthroughs likeSpaceX's reusablerockets. But after all that, even thenewest revolution, artificialintelligence, was born right there inthat small area. What is special aboutit? Why can't we replicate it in India?What is the secret source of the valleysuccess? In this video, I will break itdown for you. We'll go on a journey tofinally understanding that it's amindset thing. Yeah, I know it soundscliche, but it is a mindset thing. Thereare lots of tier one entrepreneurs.There are lots of non-funded familybusinesses and tier 2s. Capital existsin India. What holds us back is actuallythe business culture and the mindset wehave towards companies, towards failureand towards risk. Ladies and gentlemen,let's find out what makes Silicon Valleytick.Okay, I've been running companies for 1213 years now and creating content aboutbusiness and technology for 9. I wentfrom raising 1.7 crores in college frominvestors in Chicago through a coldemail to today running a 300 manbootstrapped and profitable company.I've interviewed both the top foundersin India and the top CEOs and foundersin the valley and I've spent enough timewith both ecosystems to detail exactlywhat the mindset difference is. Butbefore we begin, let's take a moment totalk about how Vibe coding couldliterally win you a brand new M4 MacBookPro. Turns out there's this thing calledCode Circuit that's rewarding people forbuilding sleek, functional web apps.Here's how it works. You just pick anidea from their list and turn it into asimple, functional hosted web app. Andthat's it. And the prizes aren't small.Starting with a brand new 1TB M4 MacBookPro for first place, a PlayStation 5 forsecond, and Apple's AirPods Pro Max forthird. But here's the best part. You canuse any text stack or libraries youwant, even LLM powered code editors likeCursor, Copilot, and Windsurf. The onlyrule is that your web app has to lookgreat and actually work. And it isn'tsome random hackathon. It's actuallybeing organized by Outlier AI, a teamthat's done real work in the AI space.They claim their contributors haveearned a combined hundreds of millionsof dollars by helping build thefoundation of today's most advanced AImodels. The deadline to submit your miniweb app is Sunday, May 18th, 11:59 p.m.Pacific time. To register, hit the linkin the description and start building.Now, let's get back to the video.Silicon Valley works because of themisfits, openly welcoming crazy,unconventional thinkers who don't reallyfit into traditional modes. See, SiliconValley understands that if you aresomeone that comes from field A andenters field B, you are very likely tobe disruptive compared to a person thatalways has been in field B. If you arefrom the payment industries but enterthe rockets industry, you have anadvantage over insiders in the rocketindustry because you probably see thingsvery differently. In India, by contrast,social and educational systems tend toreward conformity, which is being thesame as everybody else. The educationsystem emphasizes rote learning overindependent thought, which means thatany person or any kind of thinkingthat's out of the box, you often getless support or understanding for theirideas. Silicon Valley has never beenabout playing safe. Silicon Valleyactually really likes the concept of acontrarian which is somebody who thinksvery differently from the crowd. Thepeople who chase moonshots that soundabsurd till they actually work. Thiswillingness to pursue grand visions likeflying cars or private rockets to Marsis a defining trait of the valley. InIndia, if you try to do the same thing,people will say first solve this andthey'll you know add some small problemthere as if nobody else is alreadyworking on that problem. In the valleythis optimism is almost borderlinedelusional to outsiders. Yet, it's whatactually makes the valley tick. In fact,Silicon Valley literally runs on ideasyou believe, but other people don't.When I did that podcast with Sam Alman,he told me that even the idea of doingOpenAI was ridiculed by researchers andpeople even called them a rapper. Yet,people in the valley believed in themand invested money and see where theyend up. On the other hand, when Indiansbuild rappers, you can see in thecomments, people will be saying, \"Oh,it's just a rapper build.\" While at thesame time, now that 2 years have passedsince those comments, Windsurf, which isa rapper, is selling to OpenAI for $3billion. How many young kids did you alldiscouraged by saying, \"Oh, it's just arapper.\" When it turns out a lot of theexit activity now is happening inrappers. In fact, anything new isdiscouraged. When we started using AIavatars for content in 2023, forexample, I'm giving you a personalexample. I had put out this video onTwitter and synced it to a TeluguYouTuber's voice for an experiment.Almost everyone told us it wouldn'twork. And the argument was nobody'sgoing to watch AI generated content. Oh,why are you making an AI influencer makea product instead? As if we alreadyhadn't tried. Today that AI avatar makesmore money than most businesses in Indiaand I spend less than 5 minutes on itper week. But almost everyone I knowtold us it wouldn't work. Today we havea lot more channels when we deploy itand it's allowed us to capture a goodchunk of the explore feed. Time andagain, the biggest Silicon Valleysuccesses started as ideas like that,like that experts dismissed or laughedat or said, \"This is not going tocommercially work.\" Who thought in the1970s that a couple of college dropoutswould build a worldchanging personalcomputer in a garage? Apple's Steve Jobsand Steve Wnjak did exactly that. No,they proved it. But if you went back intime, you probably wouldn't havebelieved them. As investor Chris Dixonkeeps saying, the next big thing startsout looking like a toy. Early PCs weredismissed as toys. Also early socialnetworks where people just said this islike this is some game and the firstelectric sports car sounded like a richman's toy. Yet these toys became theApple, Facebook and Tesla we know today.The red pill truth here is thatbreakthrough innovation requires defyingskepticism and ridicule. SiliconValley's culture encourages. It whispersto the hacker working on a wild ideathat he or she might be right and theentire world saying hey this sucks mightbe wrong. Actually it's not that theworld is wrong. This all works becauseof saturation. If everyone believes acertain thing is correct, they might allbe right. But by the time the consensushas formed, by the time everyonebelieves in the thing, you are late.It's too late for you to win because youare in the queue. And you might be Qcontestant 15,000. There might bealready 15,000 competitors to you. Butif you take on ideas others don'tbelieve in yet, you can be number one,but you can also be wrong. Your ideamight also be bogus. And that brings meto point two, which is that you may haveideas that are very different from theideas that everybody else has, but thoseideas might still be wrong. And the onlyway for you to find out are they wrongor are they right is for you to try manyexperiments. Point two is that SiliconValley is all about experimentation. AtAOS, we basically did research on whatreally works in the valley. Andexperimentation is probably the mostimportant point. When you say thingslike, \"Oh, I'm going to do things verydifferently from the masses.\" There'salso a big chance you're wrong. So, howdo you prevent that? What's thesolution? It is to run multipleexperiments at once in parallel. Likelook at our own path, right? We werebuilding God in a box. We're buildingAlphaCTR and we were building AutocodePro at the same time as we were doingour channels, Avatars, AOS Labs, AV andYAS. In the end, even though the appsgot millions of users, moneywise, theother things did way better. No one cantell you what will do well before theytry it. And we have this epidemic ofpeople on the internet who will tell youhow something will do or how somethingwill not do. And they won't even bothertrying. They just this is their opinionthat comes, you know, for free. You haveto have strong opinions but looselyheld. I can really believe in somethingbut then when I put it out and theevidence is not there I'm like okay Idon't believe in it anymore right andthat's the only way to survive by theway you need to try and experiment seeif people like it if they like it domore of it if they don't like it don'tdo it you have to be willing to ditchold ideas if they don't work so that'sthe problem in India once you saysomething publicly you can't go againstit because it's almost like you knowyour your pride is associated with whatyou once said but this is a mistake JeffBezos says that most decisions in theworld are two-way doors some decisionsare so consequential and so importantand so hard to reverse that they reallyare oneway doors. But most decisions arenot like that. They're not like you takethe decision and then you can't changeyour mind. You can execute something andif you find out you're wrong, you canalways walk back through the door andtry a different one cuz nobody knowswhich of the doors is going to work.Jeff also says that most decisions canbe made with 70% of the data becausewaiting for 90% of data will lead toslowness and anxiety and competitorswill do it faster than you if you leavethe opportunity open for them. And ifyou don't have enough data, it's betterto try many things in parallel. Thething is when something works you haveto double down. Okay? But before itworks you cannot be a super genius whoknows upfront what will work. So theonly path is through experimenting andtrying many things and seeing whatsticks and I'll tell you why India hatesexperiments. We are a nation thatprefers vivar to experiment. I see a lotof people in India mugging up concepts.Okay. As if someone in the street isgoing to come to them with a gun andthen say hey hands up and then ask themto uh define unsupervised learning. Forcommercial success, it is better toexperiment and have outputs rather thanknow the definition of something. I'llgive you an example. Four, five yearsago, I worked on the technology calledOSC to do face capture for 3D avatarseven before Unreal Metahuman released.If you ask me today to reimplement it, Ican. I've forgotten all the concepts,but if you give me a couple of days withthe computer and you allow me to gothrough the OSC documentation again, Ican probably implement it. There areobviously better tools, but I'm justtalking about how we implemented it backthen, right? But if you ask me thedefinitions, I don't remember. It's howall the best programmers in the world doit. Their context window is limited. Andyou ask anyone with 5 10 years ofexperience, not the freshers, but youask a programmer with 5 10 years ofexperience, they can tell you theyremember what they're currently workingon. But something they implemented 2years ago, they don't rememberperfectly. Because real life is not anexam where you have to answer it, youknow, with specific text and yourdefinition has to be exactly thetextbook definition. No, it's an examwhere you prove yourself by buildingcompanies, services or products. You cansee how good someone is by the outputsof what they create.The next point is that Silicon Valley isa default to optimism ecosystem.Everyone there is optimistic, default tohelp, right? India is a default toskepticism environment. It's it's askeptical ecosystem about everything.Ideas alone of course don't buildcompanies. It's the people and networksaround them. One of Silicon Valley'sgreatest strengths is its ecosystem ofsupporting entrepreneurs and innovators.It's not just money or talent, but it'sthis mentality of openness. It's likethis grease, right? Let's say an idea islike a like a wheel that's very dry.Belief by people is like a grease thatmakes the wheel move. Otherwise, there'stoo much friction. Paul Graham pointedout that if you visit Silicon Valley,what you'll see are buildings, but it'sthe people that make it. Silicon Valleyis a place, not the buildings. And thepeople are supportive, especially tocrazy ideas. India by default thinksevery new idea is a scam or fraud, evenif you're taking money from nobody. I'llgive you a very good example from ourown experience. Remember that earlyalpha game trailer that AOS Games putout? Remember, it's an early alpha,very, very early. We want to prove whatassets we put out. Well, there was somedonations on it, 30 or 40,000 rupeesworth of donations from longtime fans.Then I went and saw there was a threadon Reddit about how there was so manydonations. And the top voted commentthere was someone saying, \"Oh, they madetheir own employees donate. It's a formof moneyaundering.\" Someone even said,\"Oh, they think they can hide thismarketing, this childlike marketing,\" orsomething like that. Just so you know,this is totally false. It's a totallyfalse thing that has 1,000 upwards. Myoffice coffee bill is 1 and a half lakhsa month and we have 300 employees today.Why would I ask my employees to send 30or 40k as donations on the YouTube videoand give 40 to 50% to YouTube? Am Istupid? And you know, I don't even blamethem. It's all very young people, right?So they don't know any better. But theproblem with India is we have a habit oflooking at every new thing as a scam orfraud. Indians freely use this word. Sofar, the game that we're making is fullybootstrapped. And this money we havemade from products and services at AOS,again, completely bootstrapped. We don'tneed any funding. But people here aredefault skeptical. Even when looking atan early alpha trailer, even withsomebody trying with their own money,they'll go so far. I I understand beinga critic and saying this can be better,that can be better. That's I think goodstuff. But Indians will go even so faras to outright lie and say, \"Oh, there'ssome donation scam that's going on.\"It's the exact same thing we faced whenwe started doing AI generatedpresenters. People told us, \"Oh, it'snot going to work.\" Some creators evenlaughed at the idea. Like, have you guysseen God of War in early alpha? Here'swhat it looks like. Or here's MidjourneyV1. But in Silicon Valley and even now,we tend to move very fast. We learn fromour mistakes and we keep improving. Inthe valley, everyone gets it. This is a0.1. This is how 0.2 will probably look.This is how, you know, version 0.5 willlook. This is how version one will look.Everyone has that insight. But in India,nobody does. Which is why we have anover supply of the same types of ideaslike grocery delivery and the same oldsoftware as a service tools cuz you'reactually less likely to get criticized.You know, even grocery delivery,quickcommerce, where today a lot ofpeople go in and everyone understandsthe idea. When it first came out inIndia, everyone criticized it. Why dopeople need groceries in 10 minutes? Nowlook at people's usage patterns. Almosteveryone uses Zeppto or a blanket. AlexDano who is a very prominent techcommentator notes that social capitalflows freely in Silicon Valley meaningknowledge connections favors they'reshared generously. I'll help you withthis understanding that at some point inthe future you're going to help me andI've helped a lot of people withoutexpectation in my career and like atsome point they'll help and theyactually do help four five years laterI've been around for more than a decadeand I can tell you they come back and dohelp you. This paid forward culture it'sit's almost akin to a gift economy. Sofounders will swap war stories and tipsover coffee and the experiencedengineers at the same time will bementoring newbies. The best alumni,let's say the PayPal alumni will bereinvesting their winnings and you knowangel investing in startups. All of thishappens as a matter of course in SiliconValley. In the valley status comes notfrom what you're building, not your jobtitle, not your pedigree. It comes whenyou are a young entrepreneur tryingsomething and there are establishedplayers helping you by adding that graceand that belief. The moment you startbuilding in the valley, everything likeI said, introductions, advice,credibility, seed funding, they flowfreely. Even though it started to becomelike this in pockets of India, it'sstill nowhere close to this in broaderIndia. And in the valley, everybodyknows that 90% of ideas will fail. Andwhile that entrepreneur might fail atthat specific idea, he or she might dobetter on the next one or the next oneor the next one. So, Indian businessculture always tends to ask why wouldyou even attempt this? Silicon Valleywill ask why not and how can we help youtry I'll give you another example rightwhen we were building this game andthere's so many examples from this rightoh people kept saying oh why not build a2D game don't even try to buildsomething harder than a 2D game and theykept saying this thing which I reallydidn't understand which is they keptsaying that oh why do Indian devs onlycare about graphics but when you doubleclick and I really want you to do thisexercise okay I want you to pause thisvideo and ask yourself thisquestionwho which Indian developer has put out agame with hyperreal graphics, but wehave quite a few 2D and indie titles.Nobody here wants you to attempt thehard and nobody has the belief that aversion 0.1 can snowball into somethingawesome. Again, there's no guaranteethat any of these ideas might becommercially successful. The chance of agame working like the kind of game weare making is like 1%. But can we provethat the product is top class over time?Absolutely. But India is defaultskeptical to that. The next thing is theattitude to failure. If there's onespecific thing that truly separatesSilicon Valley from more traditionalbusiness cultures all over the world,it's the valley's relationship with riskand failure. Failure is not the end inSilicon Valley. It's almost like thisbadge of experience. Elon Musk once saidthis, right? He said, \"Failure is anoption here. If things are not failing,you are not innovating enough.\" Thatmindset is baked into the startup scene.Most of the successful entrepreneursthere are repeat entrepreneurs.Investors in the valley don'tpermanently write you off for a flop.Many will gladly fund that second timeentrepreneur because they're like, \"Atleast you learned something. As long ashe or she learned something, they'rewilling to give them another chance.\"The logic is very simple here. Bigbreakthroughs only come with big risksand you can't have one without theother. A culture that penalizes failuresand India is a culture that hatesfailure. It ends up penalizingrisk-taking and therefore innovationitself. And Yale once said this, right?That risk-taking in India is notingrained and failure is usuallypermanent. A failed venture in Indiacarries a stigma that haunts anentrepreneurs's entire career. Whereasin Silicon Valley, a failed venture isseen as a right of passage on the way tosuccess. This safety net of secondchances is a huge part of why SiliconValley keeps pioneering new fields. InIndia, people are fighting for theirfirst shot. And we'll come to VCs inIndia in a bit. But in the valley,people are if you've taken that firstshot, it's much easier for you to getthe second shot. It's a place whereinventors feel free to try crazy thingsbecause the downside, thisembarrassment, this career damage, thisfinancial ruin is mitigated by thevalley's norms and their support system.In the early days of any disruptiveinnovation, there are far more reasonsto believe it won't work than reasons itwill. If an entire culture echoes thesedoubts, a fragile startup will neversurvive. Silicon Valley instead radiatesthis baseline optimism. Not every ideawill succeed. They know that they're notdumb, but it's worth trying. And failuredoesn't exile you from the community. InIndia, I kind of promised myself, right?If there's a founder trying somethingcool and nobody's bullying the founder,I just want you to know if you're afounder trying, if you're somebodysitting at home, even giving this a realshot, if you're doing it part-time, ifyou're trying an app, a startup,whatever it is that you're trying, youhave at least one believer, and thatbeliever is me. I'm here. I believe inyou. Even if the entire world, yourfamily, even if everybody tells you thatit's going to fail, as long as you stagethat risk, don't do it stupidly and giveup everything and give up five years ofyour life to try it if you're not sure,just to be cool. But if you are givingit a shot, even if it's part-time andyou believe in it and it sounds like acrazy idea and nobody around you thinksit'll work, just know you have abeliever in me. I know it might notmatter to most people watching this butjust know that that's there because whenI was much younger and things were veryhard for me I read a lot of many ofthese people that I look up to peoplelike Sam Alman and a bunch of othersright I would go through their blogs andthen they would echo the same thoughtsso don't worry other entrepreneurs arehere and even if the entire world isagainst you entrepreneurs are there byyour side this attitude in the valley itgives these innovators it gives peoplethinking differently fuel to attemptwhat other people wouldn't even dareright the people who are sitting andcommenting who wouldn't even dare totry. This fuel comes from this beliefcomes from the ecosystem. Paul Ram putthis best. Okay, he put this in aslightly complicated way which is hesaid that startups are marginal. Theybegin in unproven out of the way nichessome random thing that nobody reallybelieves in. Started by people who aresupposed to be doing something else andthey're incredibly fragile early on. Asociety that trims its margins that sayslet's not try crazy ideas will kill allof them. Silicon Valley cruciallydoesn't trim the margins. Instead, itcultivates an abundance of forgivenessfor the trial and error process ofinnovation. The result is an explosionof creativity and yes, plenty offailures, but also the occasionalworldbeating success that makes it allworthit. Openai will go out there and theywill say, \"We are capturing the lightcone of all future value in theuniverse.\" Elon Musk will go out thereand say, \"I would like to die on Mars,just not on impact.\" Steve Jobs wouldsay things like, \"We're here to put adent in the universe.\" You know theseare all immensely audacious things tosay. One life change I made is now Imarket things with full force. I used tobe a shy engineer afraid of even runningads. Do you know that? But now when wedo things we market it well andproperly. The thing about Silicon Valleyis that marketing is easier becausepeople fully believe in what they'redoing. Same with us. For example, whenwe say video editors are the next bigthing is because a we see the evidencein hiring activity and salaries but b wealso really believe in it. Otherwise, wewouldn't be hiring 50 video editors amonth. I'll tell you one more red pillinsight and this most of you will notbelieve but it's true and you can go andcheck. The best startup founders acrossthe world and even in India that you canthink of are both marketing and productgeniuses rolled into one. Yes, this is asurprising red pill but good marketingfolks are also very good at productespecially consumer product. Like whatdo you think Steve Jobs is? who's greatat marketing, also very good at productand deciding what customers want becausein every step you're thinking is thecustomer getting delighted by this. Inevery step you're asking, is thissharable? Is this low friction to use?Marketing requires you to be able toblink inside the mind of a consumer. Anda good product also requires you to dothat. That's why in the valley, the bestproduct people are also very good atmarketing. And it might feel strange toask how marketing people can be productpeople, but that's the most commoncombination of founders. In fact, youtake the top five to 10 good foundersfrom India uh in the old startup likethe last gen of startups, they all havethis combination. If you're a youngfounder focused on products, 99% offailures from now till when youeventually get success will not be alack of product skills, it'll be a lackof marketing and distribution. Even theattraction of Silicon Valley, theattraction of best talent to SiliconValley is marketing. Why did Sundar Payand Satya Nadella go there specificallyand not any other part of the world? Itis this allure this aura of this is agood place to be in and that wasmanufactured obviously they had lots ofproduct successes as well and they hadlots of capital to repool in but also itis the marketing because there are lotsof other places with capital[Music]too. The last thing is about talent andventure capital. India is deeplyneotistic with talent and VC withinvestors. If you know someone you canraise money or get a good job. In myfirst startup 12 years ago, I sent 70cold emails. And the VC that finallyinvested was from Chicago, not fromIndia. In India, if you want to raisefor early stages, you actually need toknow someone. Even with jobs, knowingsomeone will get you a job easier. Sure,it is true that your network is your networth and networking is a skill you canlearn. But in the valley, it's a lotmore of a meritocracy. If you're a goodfounder, you can raise pretty easily ifpeople know you're raising. The biggestVCs there are looking for new andcontrarian. Like I said, different fromnormal ideas in India. Many promisingIndian innovators without the rightconnections struggle to get noticed orfunded. Additionally, social statussignaling in India also pushes talenttowards proven career paths likegovernment or corporate jobs rather thansmall scrappy startups. For a lot ofpeople, a prestigious title oraffiliation with a big company is valuedfor status. So founding a small companymight not confer social capital until itbecomes wildly successful. But in thevalley, it is cooler to work at somesmall startup trying a new thing than towork at Google. I know that sounds odd,but it is what it is. In Silicon Valley,it celebrates if you're a founder,especially if you're doing it seriously.Being a passionate entrepreneur, even ifyou're unproven, earns you enoughrespect in the community, at least toget you some intros. In India, it'sdifferent. In India, you have to prove alot more before you before somebodystarts helping you and and gives youintros. You need to already have proventhat you're fairly successful foreverybody else to help you. You know,it's like failure. No one wants to beassociated with the valley that reallydoesn't matter. Anyway, I hope that yousee that this is a lot more culturalthan people think it is. And I really dobelieve that India has the Indiaabsolutely has the capital. I know thisfor a fact, right? India absolutely hasthe talent, right? Many of you arewatching this video. India also has theability now to do good marketing, gooddistribution. There are people who cando it. Now, it's just a mindset thing.It's can we get a group of people whocan provide thegre so that these new ideas can takeplace. That's it for me. I hope you likethis one. Bye.[Music]",
    "summary": "This YouTube video, \"5 Things India Should Learn From Silicon Valley,\" analyzes the cultural and mindset differences that contribute to Silicon Valley's unparalleled innovation and success, and suggests ways India can emulate those traits. The core argument is that while India possesses capital and talent, it lacks the specific business culture and mindset that allows for groundbreaking innovation. The video highlights five key areas: embracing \"misfits\" and contrarian thinking, the importance of constant experimentation and iteration with loosely held strong opinions, fostering a default-to-optimism ecosystem with active support and collaboration, developing a healthier attitude towards failure as a learning experience, and understanding the intertwined nature of marketing and product development and how to make them work together.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes Silicon Valley's tolerance for unconventional thinkers and moonshot ideas, contrasting this with India's tendency to reward conformity and discourage risk-taking. He stresses the necessity of running multiple experiments in parallel, adapting quickly based on the evidence, and moving away from a fear of being wrong. Further, the video identifies the supportive and collaborative nature of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, where knowledge and connections are shared generously, and a baseline optimism prevails. It also pinpoints the stark contrast in attitudes toward failure, noting that in Silicon Valley, failure is seen as a learning opportunity, while in India, it often carries a lasting stigma. The presenter stresses the role of marketing, arguing that effective product creators are skilled marketers who deeply understand consumer needs.\n\nThe final key point touches on the talent and venture capital landscape, noting Silicon Valley's meritocratic approach where good founders can raise capital more easily, whereas India is marred with neotism. The speaker argues that India needs to shift its mindset, become more accepting of unconventional ideas, embrace experimentation and risk-taking, and foster a more supportive and collaborative ecosystem. He concludes by stating that while India possesses the resources to succeed, a cultural shift is necessary to create an environment conducive to groundbreaking innovation."

    "title": "Should you become a full stack developer?",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3cG-C9vzs",
    "addedAt": "05/17/2025",
    "transcript": "I wanted to make a quick video to talkabout full stack engineers and whatexactly is a full stack engineer andshould you try to become one. Now thereason I put full stack in quotes isbecause I think this term is verygeneric. There's not like a strictdefinition of what a full stack engineerknows. All I can say is from mydefinition it's someone who isn't afraidto go and learn new things and dive intovarious parts of the codebase in yoursystem. Whether that's front end,backend, uh, CI/CD, let's say you'reusing GitHub actions, they can configurethose workflows. Let's say that you'reusing infrastructure as code likeTerraform. You're not afraid to diveinto that and understand it. From myperspective, that is what full stackmeans. And some of the definitions I'veheard online is a jack of alltrades, master of none. You could saythis has negative connotation. Maybe ithas positive connotation. Maybe it'sneutral. From my perspective, havingsomeone on your team or your project isbeneficial when they can jump aroundfrom task to task and have no issuetrying to solve it. Will they be thebest at solving this? Will theyimplement it the most optimal way, themost performant way? Probably not. Andthat's when you might need to reach outand find someone who specializes indatabase or specializes in security.They will have a much greater depth ofknowledge in that task. By the way, Iwould consider myself a full stackengineer. If you guys watch me, I kindof jump around from every singledifferent topic because I just enjoylearning new stuff. So, let's talk aboutwhat you need to understand to become aweb developer and to actually ship aproduct to production that your usersare going to use. Obviously, you needfrontend. So, this would involve likeReact, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Maybe youcan throw in Tailwind or Next.js.Everything that's related to the frontend probably be coupled to this. Maybeyou want to put accessibility in here.Although I would probably sayaccessibility is its own special littleum skill set you should probably learn.I'm also going to say skills needed toship uh products. Okay, so we got frontend, we got accessibility. Let's alsoput UI UX because if you don't know howto actually build a nice lookingapplication, no one's going to use yourapplication. You might solve a reallycool problem, but you need it to looknice as well. And honestly, some of thisstuff could be bucketed together insidea front end, but I think pulling some ofthis stuff out, like you can find areally good React developer who cannotdesign anything for his life. So, let'skeep going. We have accessibility, wehave backend, we got database, we gotsecurity, we have testing. Let's just goahead and add DevOps as well because Imean there's a lot of stuff that you endup doing that are related to DevOps. So,these are some of the skills that you'regoing to need to ship a product, right?You need to be able to build a UI. Youneed that UI to connect to a backend.That back end needs to connect to adatabase. You need to make sureeverything is secure. You need to makesure you have your stuff automated withtesting, end to-end test, integrationtest. You need to make sure you havesome type of infrastructure as code setup to deploy all your stuff that you andyour team are working on. And then ofcourse, you need to make sure it looksgood with UI and UX design. And you needto make sure it's accessible, especiallyif you have a lot of users who might bevisioned impaired. I'm going to moveaccessibility over here, but I thinkaccessibility is something important aswell. All right, so here are some of theskills. Now, I would say there'sprobably a lot more boxes you can addin. Like a site reliability engineer,they probably have to know more aboutscaling. So, like you need to know aboutscale, but we're going to just keep thissimple for right now. So, when it comesto a full stack engineer, you shouldknow a little bit about everything. Likeyou should know a little bit aboutDevOps. You should probably understandhow to use AWS console. You should knowhow to test your code. You should knowhow to make sure stuff is secure. Youshould know how to set up a database andconfigure it. Whether that's using likeAWS RDS or some type of like neondatabase, you should know how to buildbackend endpoints. You should know howto build a frontend. Like you shouldhave used enough SAS applications tohave a good feel about what a gooddesign application feels like versus howa badly designed application would kindof function. So I guess my perspectiveof a full stack engineer is thateverything that you might need to knowto ship a product from scratch, likewriting it from the ground up, youshould be able to do it by yourself. Itmight take you a while. You might notwrite the most performant code. It mighttake you a little bit longer when you'redealing with tasks related to database,but for a new startup or a small projectthat you don't have a ton of users offthe bat, knowing enough to be able toship a fully productionready applicationis what I would consider a full stackengineer. Now, if you don't feel likeyou can do this, maybe you're more oflike a specialist. So, the differencebetween a full stack and a specialist isthat a specialist might not care aboutfront end. So, they don't actually doanything on the front end. I'm going toadd this line here. This is your widthof skills. I think it's also calledbreadth of skills, breadth of knowledge,or you can call it skills. And this isyour depth. Okay. So again, we'retalking about a specialtist now. Sowe're going to go ahead and just likemove this up. Let's say we're doing aspecialist. Now, for some projects andteams, if the project is larger in scaleand it's already been in production for5 or 10 years and you have millions ofusers, let's say you have hundreds ofrequests per second, you may havedifferent needs for the project, right?you have a decently working UI andbackend, but now you might need to hirepeople who can come in and make stuffmore performant, try to save someoperational cost. So, let's say you wantto hire someone who is a specialist inDevOps and cloud engineering. This issomeone who might have a ton ofknowledge with Google Cloud Platform orAWS with infrastructure as code, CI/CDpipelines, but their job is to come inand look at how you're currently runningyour application and try to figure outways to get this all deployed out. Maybethey can save costs by using lambdas orthey can save costs by using like sometype of manage AWS service. Maybe theycan save cost by spinning up aKubernetes cluster with on bare metalmachines and managing all that. Okay, soagain a specialist has a ton ofknowledge in one special silo and thisis very valuable to companies as wellespecially when they're more mature andthey need to come through and hirepeople who can improve stuff. Okay,let's look at one more example of aspecialist. Let's say you have adatabase and you're working at like aninsurance company. Many of thesedatabases have been around for like 10or 20 years and so they have likehundreds of tables and they have liketons of constraints between these tablesin their Postgress database or MySQLdatabase or Microsoft SQL database andthen they might have tons of storedprocedures and the code is huge. Theyhave a ton of stuff that needs to befixed and maintained and so they mightneed to hire someone like a databaseengineer. You can come through here makesure that it is scaled properly. It's,you know, they set it up to have readreplicas. They know how to make surethat we can handle all the traffic fromall the various microservices that maybe trying to hit this database. And ofcourse, they're going to have expertisein backend. Like you're not going to beable to become a database engineerwithout knowing a little bit aboutbackend, a little bit about security.But the point is is that the specialistmight not care about frontend at all.They might have never touched HTML, CSS,and JavaScript. And that's fine. Theirgoal is to scale up the backend of asystem that's getting a ton of users.All right, we just learned about what afull stack engineer is. We learned aboutwhat a specialist is. Let's pivot backto full stack and just kind of talk alittle bit about this. When would acompany want to hire a full stackengineer? From my perspective, if youhave a smaller project and you don'thave as much money, you probably can'tafford a database engineer becausethey're going to cost a lot of money.There's they're probably high in demandand they're very very low in supply. Andso if you look at basic economics, ifit's high demand, low supply, they'regoing to be very expensive. So hiringsomeone who's very very good atconfiguring databases and making surethat they scale is probably going tocost a little bit more than a full stackengineer who knows how to jump betweenthese various skill sets. Okay. So ifyour project doesn't have an extremeamount of capital, maybe you want tohire a full stack engineer who can atleast get the job done. You can throwany task at them and they can implementit. Another reason a full stack engineeris good is because they can fill in thegaps when people leave. Frank, forexample, if people go on vacation for 2weeks or a month, because you have fullstack engineers on your team, they don'thave a problem picking up the slack orthe void of work when people go onvacation or people quit, right? Peopleleaving companies is a legit risk thatyou have to kind of keep in mind on yoursoftware engineering project and team.So, you definitely want to have somepeople to be able to fill in the gapswhen people leave. For example, let'ssay your team has a couple of front-endspecialists and a couple of backendspecialists, and you have maybe two orthree full stack engineers who like tocome in here and just kind of bouncebetween the front end and the back endand try to play a support character.From my perspective, a full stackengineer is kind of like the the medicin TF2. I don't know if you played TF2.I might be getting too nerdy right now,but in TF2, the medic is a support role,right? Their role is to go around andheal other players. From my perspective,that's kind of what a full stackengineer is. They're able to go intovarious places in your codebase and givesupport to whoever might need it, justimplement features and fix bugs whereverthey may need to do that. But the mainissue with the full stack engineer, theydon't have that depth of knowledge. Sothere's going to be some times wherethey're going to get a task and theyjust legit can't solve it. It's going totake them a lot longer. Now, eventuallythey will solve it and as they're tryingto solve it, they're going to kind oflike expand their depth of knowledge inthis topic, but it's going to take themlonger because they haven't invested allthis time to become very very good atsecurity or databases. So, when youthrow them a task that's related toupdating some Terraform code, they maynot be fully up to speed with it, butthey can eventually learn it, right? Idon't think any engineer in thisindustry can't learn something. I thinkif you like to box yourself into aparticular category, you're doingyourself and your team a disservice. Ithink you should be willing and eager tohelp out where help is needed,especially if you don't feel likethere's a lot of tasks coming in thatare related to your specialty. Okay. So,I think full sack engineers are probablymore valuable at a smaller company, astartup or like a twoman team. Like, yougot to end up doing everything. And forme, I like doing that. I like learning alot about everything. I don't reallyhave the patience. Maybe it's like ADHDor something, but I can't just stick toone topic and just learn it to like thedepth of an expert. Like I just have aproblem like sticking to one thing andjust really really diving in deep andlearning to it. I get kind of burned outquickly and bored. And for me, I likebeing a full sec engineer. Granted, itmight not pay as much as becoming aspecialist. But I think working at asmaller company where you wear multiplehats, you jump around from skill toskill trying to help out where you can,I feel rewarded doing that because Ifeel like I'm making an impact on theproject. Now again, the differencebetween a full stack and a specialist isyou were hired to do one thing and do itwell. So, who is trying to hire someonewho can do one thing and do it well?These are probably companies that havebeen around for a while. For example,Google. They're probably going to lookfor someone who's really good atdatabases and backend to try to makesure that the systems they're buildingcan handle the scale that is needed tohandle the millions of users that Googlehas. And so, you're going to get hired.You are going to be doing backend andthat is your full-time job. You're goingto be doing databases and that is yourfull-time job. Every day you wake upeight hours a day, 40 hours a week ormore, and that's what you do. And somepeople love that. I mean, it pays reallywell. There's probably tons of stuffwhen it comes to databases that'll keepyou entertained and you'd have fun justlearning everything you can aboutdatabases, but for me, I just don't wantto spend a bunch of time in the weedsand the technical side of things. So,when it comes to specialists, a lot ofpeople probably like doing this. I wouldsay also getting into consulting isprobably a great way. If you want tobecome a database expert, you couldprobably do some freelancing orconsulting and make a decent amount ofmoney. I know there's a lot ofconsultants who charge like, you know,$150 to $200 an hour, right? You canmake a lot of money being a consultant,but it also requires that you know a lotabout this topic so that you can jumpfrom team and project and company, workwith them for a couple of months, helpguide their team on a path to success,and then you bounce and try to work onanother company. But honestly, to get tothis level of skill and value, it'sprobably going to take you a long time.And this is probably going to bereserved for people who have been in theindustry for like 10, 20, 30 years,right? That kind of wraps up theoverview of a full stack versus aspecialist. Now, I guess my question toyou all, if you're still watching, is doyou think a full stack engineer is asvaluable as a specialist? Do you think aspecialist is more valuable or do youthink every team should have a nicemixture of the two? I would say thatfrom the projects I've worked on, everydeveloper has a certain set of skills.And so, I wouldn't say that like there'salways going to be a specialist. Thereare people on your team who are reallygood at accessibility. Like, he's thego-to person. And so you want to go andyou ask them questions aboutaccessibility. There's people who arereally good at the database on yourteam. So you probably go to them and askquestions. But you can actually have awhole team of full stack engineers aslong as you have different engineers onthe team who decide to specialize alittle bit in various topics and kind oflike maybe not specialize as much inother areas. But I would say this iscommon. Even if you're a full stackengineer, I think there's one or twotopics that you probably enjoy more thanothers. And so by default, you're goingto become kind of like the team expertin this area. And if you have enoughpeople on a team, what ends up happeningis you're going to have this skill setoverlap where, okay, although one personis not really good at databases, they'regoing to be really good at front end.Okay? And so like if you can at leastmake sure that your team has enoughoverlap with these things so thateventually you have enough of thesereally deep bars of knowledge andexpertise, I think your team is going tobecome very very performant and be ableto get a lot of work done. All right,I've been rambling for a while now. Solet me know if you guys like this videoor if there's anything you want me toexpand upon in a future video. Have agood day and happy coding.",
    "summary": "This video explores the definition of a \"full stack engineer\" and whether aspiring developers should aim to become one. The speaker defines a full stack engineer as someone comfortable learning and working across various aspects of a project, from front-end (React, HTML, CSS) and back-end development to database management, security, UI/UX design, DevOps (CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code), and accessibility. They emphasize that full stack doesn't imply mastery in everything, but rather the ability to contribute to all parts of a project and \"ship a product from scratch\". While not always the most optimal or performant solution, full stack engineers are valuable because they can fill in knowledge gaps and get things done.\n\nThe video contrasts full stack engineers with specialists who possess deep expertise in a particular area, such as database engineering or cloud engineering. Specialists are crucial for mature companies with large-scale projects requiring optimized performance and cost savings. Smaller companies and startups benefit from hiring full stack engineers due to their versatility, ability to handle various tasks, and capacity to cover when specialists are unavailable. The speaker also shares that a team composed entirely of full stack engineers can be effective if individuals choose to specialize in one or two domains, creating sufficient overlap in expertise to handle any situation.\n\nThe speaker shares that, while being a specialist might be more lucrative, they find personal fulfillment as a generalist because they prefer diverse tasks and the ability to contribute across various project areas. Ultimately, the video suggests that both full stack engineers and specialists have distinct value and the ideal team composition may vary depending on the project's size, maturity, and specific needs. The value of the full stack engineer lies in their ability to contribute to a project at all stages and to support the work of others."

    "transcript": "Life just got a heck of a lot harder forall those VS Code forks that you knowand love. Yes, believe it or not,Microsoft just opensourced their AIeditor. What they mean with this isthey're about to start open sourcing allof the GitHub copilot chat pieces thatare in VS Code. And that's not the endof the things they announced. They alsoannounced that they're open sourcingWindows Subsystem for Linux, which isreally cool. This is a hugephilosophical change for Microsoft. Iwas lucky enough to chat with them alittle bit about what's going on and Ihave a ton that I want to share with youguys both from the philosophy of whyMicrosoft is doing these things to theimpact it will have on a bunch ofcompanies you know that I talk about alot here. I'm also an investor in abunch of those companies and this mightbe the end of them. So, uh, someone hasto pay the bills. We're going to do aquick sponsor break and then dive intoall the things you need to know aboutthis change. AI has made a lot of thingseasier, but it made one thingsignificantly harder. Interviewing. Yes,recruiting is in a terrible place rightnow. If you've opened up a job listingon your site, you know exactly what I'mtalking about. You're suddenly gettingtens of thousands of applicants withterrible AI generated resumes and tryingto find the good ones in the pile. It'snearly impossible. Trying to hire agreat engineer feels like just anon-stop hill you're climbing up. Unlessyou use today's sponsor, G2I has solvedhiring. I know it's a crazy statement,but honestly, all of the people thatI've been talking to that started usingG2I have been blown away with them. So,you can take my word for it or we canjust read some of these crazytestimonials. Shop Monkey said that theymade 17 hires in 60 days. Do you knowhow crazy that is? Especially to nothave to fire half of them after cuz youhired too quickly. If these are justrandom junior engineers with noexperience or vibe coders that have nobackground, that'd be one thing. Butthat's not the case at all. G2I has beenworking for eight years to build uptheir pool of over 8,000 experiencedengineers. These are people with realindustry experience. all over the stack,back end, front end, mobile, web,whatever the heck you guys are doing,there's a very good chance you have abunch of awesome engineers that arealready part of G2I's network. Thecoolest part though is the videoplatform. Once you've decided you wantto hire for a given role, you write up abunch of questions, you give them somestuff that's important to you, and thenG2I goes out and gives those questionsto a bunch of the engineers in theirnetwork. And then you get to use theirapp to go through all of theseinterviews with all of these peoplewhere humans are answering the questionon video. so you can get an actual ideaof what this person is like to workwith. They're not just handing you alist of names and saying good luck.They're doing most of the hard work foryou. From the vetting to the interview,they will smooth the process out.They'll even spin up a shared Slackchannel with you as part of theirdefault process. They've said for a bitnow that from starting working with themto first PR from your new hire is 7days. My favorite thing about theplatform though, and I wish we could dothis more realistically for traditionalroles, when you do decide you likesomebody, you bring them on for 7 days,and if they're not shipping the way youwant them to, you don't have to pay ascent. And if you want someonedifferent, they will backfill within theweek. Remote or in person, backend orfrontend, contract, full-time, whateveryou need, these guys will hire in daysinstead of months. Give them a shottoday atsoyv.link/gti. So, why is Copilot goingopen-source? We've talked about parts ofthis before, but I think it's importantto like quickly understand what VS Codebeing open source meant in the firstplace. VS Code is an open- source editorthat a lot of people use. It's probablythe most popular editor ever made atthis point. It's open source, which isawesome because you can fork it. It'sMIT licensed. You can do a ton of coolthings to it. But for the most part,we've been extending VS Code with theextensions API, which is a way to add awidget into the side of VS Code that hasan iframe that can do things.Occasionally, it's stuff like languageservers or themes and whatnot. Buthistorically, we've been relativelylimited with what we can do usingextensions. So, as such, the effectiverole of VS Code being open source was sothat people could see the code, makechanges to things that were broken, andcontribute with like the team making it.But it wasn't like a bunch of peoplewere using that code to do things. It'sthey were fixing things wrong with it.That is until one big thing happened.That's what we're talking about today.It's co-pilot. Copilot kind of changedthe game. The idea of your editorwriting your code with you and for youwas huge and immediately resulted in aexplosion of things trying to do thesame. The first attempts were mostlyalso VS Code extensions. The problem wasthat you needed a really deepintegration with VS Code to have a goodexperience to do things like tabcomplete jumping to the thing that youwant to change or having like the diffsinlined underneath the thing that ischanging. So despite VS Code being open-source and the extension platform beingvery well established, the capabilitiesof the platform did not align up withthe things people wanted. And slowlycopilot had to diverge from thetraditional extension path and it had abunch of special stuff built into VSCode that they could use that otherextensions couldn't. So what justchanged? I want to be very clear aboutwhat hasn't changed first and foremost.So C-pilot server backend is stillclosed source. So if you think you canget the whole co-pilot experience,backend, frontend, servers, managementof tokenization and like context windowsand all the chaos that it takes to buildsomething like this, they were veryexplicit that that is not what they aredoing here. The magic of the co-pilotservers and APIs is not something we getany insight into. But that's notactually something I care that muchabout. The other important pieces isthat this hasn't happened fully yet. Sothis wasn't like, oh, here's the code.It's all open source now. You can dowhatever you want. This is theannouncement of the plan to startchanging these things. And one of thebig things they plan to change, whichagain is not done yet, but they areworking on it and want the community tobe involved, is the opening up of theAPIs that co-pilot uses. They do verymuch intend to make it so a third partythat's willing to build their ownservers, handle the inference stuffthemselves, could get the same qualityof experience in VS Code that Copilothas. In order to do that before, you hadto fork VS Code, which is why we saw somany forks from void to pair to Windsurfto, of course, cursor. I'm invested inthree of the four I just mentioned. Thisis going to be a fun window for all ofthose. That said, this also kind oflevels the playing field. As crazy as itsounds to say Microsoft came in andpotentially directly harmed the plansand business models for all of thosecompanies, this means more businessescan compete more effectively. If youdon't have to build a whole editor andmanage a whole VS Code ecosystem forkedout from scratch yourself, which meansyou have to let go of things like themarketplace, you have to manage securityincidents and pull in the changes byhand. You have to deeply understand VSCode to do that. Now you can just make anew extension that has a similar qualityof experience. One way of thinking ofthis is like the what capability andquality was possible. Let's say we havea chart showing the quality that'spossible with different solutions. Ifyou are co-pilot, we'll say co-pilot'squality is here. So co-pilot is thisgood. If you were just building an AIextension on VS Code before the thingsthat are announced today get shipped,the quality you were capable of shippingwas much much lower than what C-Pilotcan do. So if you wanted to meet thisbar that co-pilot had set, if you sawthe line there and you wanted to buildsomething that was as good if notbetter, you really couldn't because wewere limited by this bar, the quality ofwhat was possible via an extension. Soin order to get past that, in order toget to where Copilot was at andtheoretically go even further, you hadto fork. And this is the problem thatthe Microsoft team saw. VS Code fork. Itis significantly more capable if youfork VS code and you have the teamthat's capable of doing it and managingit. We've seen all the crazy stuff youcan do in stuff like you know cursor. Ilove it. It's a really good editorexperience. The problem is thatmaintaining a VS Code fork has a ton ofconsequences and problems and it alsomeans the entry point to do this isreally high. We could also frame this aslike how hard is it to build thesedifferent things and honestly thecurrent chart would kind of representthat as well. Building and maintaining afork of VS Code is really hard if youdon't have the budget of a team like theco-pilot team at Microsoft. WhatMicrosoft's trying to do here is theywant to take the AI extensions and theidea of people building things like thatnew integrated experiences like Kleinthink things like Klein and AugmentCode. If you're notfamiliar is an agent that you caninstall as an extension inside of VSCode. It's also open source which isreally cool. And then there's AugmentCode who has been a sponsor of thechannel that I quite enjoy using.They're one of the few AI like codethings I use outside of cursor becausethey do an incredible job of indexinggigantic code bases. They're not payingfor this video. I just really like usingthem to download an open source repo andtry to figure out how it implementedsomething. So things like that arecurrently very limited by what they cando in VS Code because they effectivelyjust have the iframe API. So Microsoft'strying to do is pull this out so it canget to the same quality level asC-pilot. Does that mean they can go asfar as a VS Code fork? probably not. Butat the very least, wherever the bar isset for co-pilot, over time, thecapability of extensions is going to getto the same place, which is a veryexciting change. Let's quickly read whatthey have to say about this. So, it'snot just my thoughts and words. Webelieve the future of code editorsshould be open and powered by AI. Forthe last decade, VS Code has been one ofthe most successful open source projectson GitHub. We are grateful for ourvibrant community of contributors andusers who choose VS Code because it isopen source. Za becomes core to thedeveloper experience in VS Code. Weintend to stay true to our foundingdevelopment principles. Open,collaborative, and communitydriven. Wewill open source the code in the GitHubcopilot chat extension under MIT. Thisis something I meant to call outearlier. They're not just open source,they're MIT licensed, which means youcan do whatever you want with them. It'snice to see them not change that. Theycould have done a license that was likeyou can make whatever you want with thisbut you can't sell a competing product.There's a lot of companies that havelicenses like that. They just went MITso you're still able to fork. You couldeven make the argument that buildingyour own cursor just got a lot easierdue to the stuff that they are planningto do here. As they were saying oncethey've open sourced this they plan tocarefully refactor the relevantcomponents of the extension into VS CodeCore. So the parts that are currentlyallowing for a lot of the customintegrations for the cool likeautocomplete inline stuff, all thethings that make the copilot chatextension unique are going to startmaking their way into VS Code Core soother extensions can take advantage ofthem. As they said, this is the next andlogical step for us in making VS Code anopen-source AI editor. The reflectionthat AI powered tools are core to how wewrite code. A reaffirmation of ourbelief that working in the open leads toa better product for our users andfosters a diverse ecosystem ofextensions. Really cool to see. Theobvious next question is why now when wehave cursor raising a ton? We have windsurf maybe getting bought. Still haven'tgotten an update on that by the way. Ithink it's happening. The rumors havegone way too far for them to not. Butit's interesting. I think after thisnews especially they're going to want totake that deal. Then there's Perryi andVoid, which are also both open source VSCode forks focused on AI experience andAI code stuff. I haven't heard much fromeither of those, which is concerning. Sowith all of that going on, why now? Theywere pretty transparent about this,which I thought was cool. Over the lastfew months, we've observed shifts in AIdevelopment that motivated us totransition our AI dev in VS Code fromclosed to open source. The biggestpoint, and I think this is reallyimportant to understand, is that LLMshave been continuously significantlyimproving. So the secret sauce that madeco-pilot work in the past matters a lotless. Prompts are going open constantlynow. More and more I'm seeing companiessaying screw it. Who cares if our promptgets shared? It's not that specialanymore. As the models get better, thesystem prompts not saying they don'tmatter. I'm saying they they are lesssecretive and they are less uniquelyvaluable. Especially as a new modelcomes out. Your old system prompt inorder to fix things like weird diffingmight just not work at all. Especiallynow that models like GPT4.1 are trainedon git diffs, so they can do diffingsyntax directly instead of having torewrite the whole file. Previously,Copil was using like a custom modelderived from GPT3 that had a ton ofsystem prompts to make it function atall. I'm sure that was essential to whythey decided to keep it closed source atthe time. That barely matters anymore.There are lots of companies with betterAI editing experiences than whereco-pilot was. The next point they had isthat the most popular and effective UXtreatments for AI interactions are nowcommon across editors. Yes, it took abit for us to get to that point, but allthe things we now expect in our AIexperience like command I to open thesidebar, command K to autocomplete fromhere, tab to blast through the changes,all of those things are relativelystandard and you can hop from windsurfto cursor to copilot and not feel likeyou're entirely in a new world. We wantto enable the community to refine andbuild these common UI elements by makingthem available in a stable and opencodebase. Huge. An ecosystem of opensource AI tools and VS code extensionshas emerged. We want to make it easierfor these extension authors to build,debug, and test their extensions. Thisis especially challenging today withoutaccess to the source code in the C-pilotchat extension. This is another point Ithink is really worth considering. WhenMicrosoft looks at two types ofcompanies, if we have Windurf and Cursoron one side and we have Klein andAugment on the other, this is whoMicrosoft wants to have win. But rightnow, these guys are very much winning.There is a reason for that. It's becausethese guys are doing things Microsoftdoesn't like that they can win. Sincethey chose to fork, since they chose todo the hard thing and rebuild VS Codeand manage the fork that you have donefrom it, they now get a benefit thatclient and augment don't. They can makethe changes and make the quality ofexperience that Copilot has when thesecompanies couldn't. So if Microsoft seesthis as an imbalance where they wantthese guys to win and they want theseguys to fail, this is the most logicalthing they could possibly do. This isparticularly funny to me because in myvideo on Windinsurf, my like final takewas that the best thing OpenAI could dowould be open source it because therewasn't a big open-source player in theAI editor space yet. Now there is. Nowthe biggest open- source editor is alsothe biggest open- source AI editor.Well, at least it's getting there. Ithink this is the most important pointto take home from here. Not thatMicrosoft necessarily wants to killthese companies and destroy them. Morethat they want companies doing the theright thing building into the VS Codeecosystem. They don't want them to be ata disadvantage. They want to make iteasier for more companies like this tofind more success and build betterexperiences within VS Code. But in orderto do that, they have to open up more,which is why they chose to doit. There's a couple more quick pointsthat I thought were interesting. Theywant to share more of how the chatextension actually collects data andwhere the data is being sent to and fromto give you a better idea with just moretransparency if you could read the code.That's a cool thing to see. And alsomalicious actors who have been targetingthese AI dev tools. If it's open source,it's easier for us to scan through tofind problems and also identify fixesand go through the whole process of howexploitations happen. Really cool tosee. Coming weeks, we'll work to opensource the code in the GitHub copilotchat extension, as well as refactor theAI features from the extension into VSCode directly. Our core prioritiesremain intact. Deliver greatperformance, powerful accessibility, andan intuitive, beautiful user interface.Open source works best when communitiesare built around a stable and sharedfoundation. That's the key. Since Cursorand Windsurf aren't open source, they'reall a increasingly brokenoff fork of VSCode. The community is no longerbuilding around this single sharedcenter point and they want that tochange. They want the same VS codeeverywhere. And the selfish reasons whyare actually a lot smaller than youmight think. It's stuff like the C++extension that they maintain breakingbecause cursor does some specific thingthat was patched in VS Code a while ago.They never backfilled. That type ofstuff is just annoying when thefoundation isn't shared. There's a hugepart of why Linux did so well. It's alsoa huge part of why I have a grudgeagainst Android because they hard forkedthe Linux kernel. The more we can sharethat foundation, the better we can be asa community in iterating and building ontop of a thing. And then the statedgoal, as I've been saying, their goal isto make contributing AI features assimple as contributing to any part of VSCode. The stcastic nature of largelanguage models makes it especiallychallenging to test AI features andprompt changes. To ease this, we'll alsomake our prompt testing infra opensource to ensure the community PRs canbuild and pass tests, too. That's reallycool. They shared their whole iterationplan publicly. So, if you're the type ofperson that wants to keep up with thedetails of how this all beingimplemented, it's all there if you wantto do it, which is really, really cool.This complements the agent mode stuffthey also officially released todayreally well. The idea of a fully agenticVS Code experience being open source issuper exciting. WSL going open source isjust again showing their commitment toopen source and building on a sharedfoundation. And then there was one otherthing I didn't mention. I probablyshould have put it in the intro. Edit.Yes, Microsoft released a Vim competitortoday that is open- source, which iskind of crazy that Microsoft found thatit was worthwhile to build their own CLIeditingexperience. I also love that it payshomage to the MS DOS editor. This looksreally cool. It's something I plan toplay with later. Let me know what youguys think about it and if you want awhole dedicated video. That's all I gotfor now. Wait, it's inRust. This is wild. Oh,Microsoft. There's always something totalk about, isn't there? Well, thanksfor joining me on my day off. Hope youguys enjoyed this. Let me know what youthink. And until next time, peace nerds.",
    "summary": "The video discusses Microsoft's recent announcement to open-source the GitHub Copilot chat extension within VS Code, marking a significant philosophical shift for the company and a major change for the AI-assisted code editor landscape. While the Copilot server backend will remain closed source, the opening of the Copilot chat extension's code (under the MIT license) and its related APIs will enable third-party developers to build AI-powered extensions with a similar level of integration and quality previously exclusive to Copilot. This move aims to level the playing field, potentially impacting companies that forked VS Code to create specialized AI-powered editors like Cursor and Windsurf by removing their exclusive access to deep editor integration.\n\nThe decision is driven by several factors, including the rapid improvement of Large Language Models (LLMs) making Copilot's previous \"secret sauce\" less critical, the standardization of effective UX treatments for AI interactions in editors, and the desire to foster a more robust ecosystem of open-source AI tools and VS Code extensions. Microsoft wants to empower developers to build better AI-assisted coding experiences within the established VS Code ecosystem, ensuring a shared foundation for the community and preventing fragmentation through divergent forks. The goal is to make contributing AI features as straightforward as contributing to any part of VS Code.\n\nFurthermore, the video mentions the open-sourcing of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the release of a new, open-source, Rust-based CLI editor by Microsoft. The speaker views these announcements as reinforcing Microsoft's commitment to open source and building on a shared foundation. Ultimately, the open-sourcing of Copilot's chat extension aims to foster innovation and collaboration in the AI-assisted coding space, enabling a more diverse range of extensions and tools to flourish within the VS Code ecosystem."

    "summary": "The video \"I'VE HAD ENOUGH!!!\" is a humorous rant by the speaker about various pet peeves he has with different programming languages. The central theme is the speaker's frustration with inconsistencies, illogical design choices, and perceived inefficiencies in languages like Go, Bash, JavaScript, and Lua. He expresses specific grievances with Go's promise to not enforce newlines while seemingly doing so in switch statements, its inability to handle newlines in \"else if\" statements, and its overall betrayal of their \"gentleman's agreement.\"\n\nHis complaints extend to Bash, where he finds the \"esac\" keyword (case spelled backwards) utterly ridiculous. JavaScript draws his ire due to its handling of large integer parsing, particularly the use of scientific notation after six zeroes. Lua is criticized for combining \"else\" and \"if\" into the single word \"elseif\" and for its indexing, as well as the syntax choices it makes. Finally, he mocks modern JavaScript developers' preference for lambda functions assigned to constants, arguing that it's often more verbose and less readable than simply defining a standard function.\n\nOverall, the video is a comedic expression of the speaker's strong opinions on what he considers to be poor design choices in programming languages. He presents these opinions with passion and humor, highlighting specific examples and absurdities that fuel his frustration. While acknowledging that no language is perfect, the video serves as a cathartic release of pent-up annoyance and an entertaining critique of some widely used programming tools."

It's not just you and me.It's everyone.(pensive music)Boredom is on the rise,even at a time when we're in\nthe golden age of content.Boredom isn't simple,it's not trivial, it's not benign.It's actually a painful emotionthat quietly haunts our\nsense of meaning and purpose.It's more like pain or disgust.We've been going deep on this.There's a lot of great new science.My producer, Alex, read like\nfive books on the topic.In all of this literature,I am starting to see a\nclear story that explainswhy all of us are more bored than ever,but I'm also seeing something\nthat I didn't expect.Something that's quietly hiddenwithin the feeling of boredom.How this really unpleasant\nfeeling, boredom,might actually be keyto living a more\npurposeful, creative life.(inquisitive music)Your life is like a road trip.Stick with me while I build this analogybecause it's actually really usefulfor understanding the\nreal meaning of boredom.It's a road trip in the dark.In this analogy, the\nmost important parts are,first off, your headlights.This is your attention.Your ability to pay attention\nand what you pay attention to.And the second most important\npart is this fuel tank.We're gonna look at this a lot.This represents your sense\nof meaning and purpose.It helps motivate you,pushes you along the journey of your life.Attention and meaning are vitalfor how humans navigate their lives,how they make decisions on where to gowith the constraints of\ntheir everyday experience.These determine the route that\nyou take on this road trip.So you're going along your life,you're taking turns,you're making decisions\non how to spend your time.You spend time with friends,\nyou pay attention to this.And look, your tank is filling\nup with meaning and purpose.For a lot of us, friendship is fuel.You go for a walk, maybe in nature.You listen to music that\nis meaningful to you.Maybe you watch a good movie,you shine your attention on that,and that is actually pretty fulfilling.But life is heavy and hard,and sometimes your fuel runs out.Your attention fractures or fades,and then this happens.(audio warbling)Lights out.(switch clicks)\nThis is boredom.The state where your sense of purposeand meaning is on empty.And consequently, you don't\nreally have the abilityto muster the energy to\npay attention to somethingthat would change the situation.Real quick before we go on.Have you noticedthat one way you might\ncure your boredom is email.Knocking out a few emails\nmakes you feel productive.Doesn't take that much work sometimes,but if you look closely,you might note that a lot of\nthe emails you're knocking outare actually junk.Like they shouldn't have been there.You don't want them there.You never signed up for them.The same thing extends to robocallsand all of those text messages you get,and even junk mail being\nsent to your house.It's sort of a constant low-level buzzand one that I kind of hate.I'm telling you all this'cause it has to do with\nour sponsor today, Incogni.Incogni has woken me upto just how extensive a industry\nthe data broker market is.These are companieswho make a lot of money off of\ncollecting your information,your address, your shopping\nhabits, your birthday,your court records,and selling it to anyone willing to pay,marketers, credit agencies,\ninsurance companies,you name it.I actually heard about\nIncogni a few years ago.I signed up.I gave them permission to act on my behalfand then they went out\nto these data brokersand say to them in some legal language,\"Hey, take Johnny off your lists.\"And it has worked hundreds\nof times, actually,automatically, without\nme having to do anything.I actually just get to sit backand look at this fancy-looking dashboard,see the status of all of the\nrequests that have been madeand the ones that have been successful,which, at this point, there's\nlike hundreds of them.Let me do a little update right now.Incogni,what is my current number of...Dude, 744 total requests\nto these data brokers?And of those, 612 have been completed.That's very satisfying.132 are in progress.Man, this is great.Just this month, there\nhave been more than 10.You just see all of this.\nIt's very satisfying.They just launched this unlimited plan,which now allows you to\nrequest removal from any site,including those creepy people search sitesthat post your info\nonline for anyone to see.So if you wanna try this out,go to incogni.com/johnnyharris.Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel.If you use the code,\njohnnyharris, at checkout,you get 60% off the annual plan.I do the annual plan because, like I said,like every month there are\nmore lists that I get added toand Incogni scans them\nand takes me off of them.So thank you, Incogni, for\nsponsoring today's video,for allowing us to do this work.With that, let's dive back\ninto why we are so bored.The most surprising thing\nthat I've learned so farwhile researching this isthat boredom is not this\ntrivial, mundane feeling.It's actually a pretty\nstrong emotional experience,and it kind of sucks.- I define boredom as meaning withdrawalas a sense of discomfort,telling you that your needfor personal meaning is not being met.- Your brain's way of telling you,you need to change what you're doingbecause what you're doing is unsatisfying.You find it hard to focus.- And that feeling of like,\"I can't do anything about this.I don't have any agency here.\"Or, \"What's the meaning of all of this?\"You're just kind of stuck there.- [Lars] I'd say that the experienceof boredom is an experience of unfreedom,an experience of being\ntrapped in the presentwithout meaning.- [Nathaniel] Time seems to slow.- [Lars] It's like you're\nin a situation where,\"I don't care about this.This really doesn't\nstimulate me in any way.\"- [Alicia] Tolstoy described boredomas like a desire of desires.- I also remember a friend of mine,he worked with the postal\nservices when we're students,and his job was to take mailbags\nand turn them inside outto see if there was any\nletters remaining in there.And one day he told me,\"Yesterday at work, I\njust started weeping.\"I mean this was \"The Myth of Sisyphus,\"the eternal recurrence of the same.There is no end to it.There will always be\nanother mailbag coming inthat would have to be turned inside out.No progression, just the\nsame over and over again.And he started weeping at work.Though being a good Protestant,he continued to turn mailbags inside outwhile he was weeping.(person sobbing)- For me, this happens usually\non a Saturday at like 3:00 PMThis is when my kids are\noccupied playing with friendsor playing Nintendo, or whatever.I have time.I usually don't have time,but Saturday at 3:00 PM,I have precious free time that\nI don't get during the week.And I have all this\nstuff that I want to do,but then this emotion just hits me.This feeling that I don't\nreally want to do anything.Like I can't really muster the\nmotivation to do any of it,and suddenly things\nget really dark for me.I start to question everything.(pensive music)\n(people murmuring)I start to question my life choices.I'm angry at myself for not doing thingsthat I know some part of me wants to do.I'm wondering if I've made\nthe right life choices.So I know this feeling well,but before reporting this story,I never called it boredom.I kind of thought it was\nlike some flash of depressionor restlessness,or maybe it was my ADD or something.Boredom always just felt like this thingthat like there's nothing\nto do and so I'm bored,but that's actually not\nwhat's happening here.Many would call it an emotional statethat has cognitive and\nphysiological correlates.- Boredom is the feeling of thinking.It's an affective response\nto under utilizationof our capacities, of our\ncognitive skills, right?So when you're bored,you are having that affective reactionto the fact that you're not\nusing your brain as wellas you could be.- So yeah, boredom is an emotion,and it's very uncomfortable.But luckily, I've got a\nvery quick little medicinethat is in my pocket at all times.It is not in my pocket right now.Uh-oh, where's my little medicine?It's a small computer devicethat was probably made in China or India,and it's got software on\nit that numbs my boredom.Some people call it a phone,but a phone is a thing that\nwas invented like 100 years agowhere people talk to each other.Where is it? Where is my phone?Oh, here she is.She was here the whole time.Ah, my precious.- [Reporter] Being nowwith the latest nuclear missile\ntest conducted just about-- [Interviewee] About three\nyears ago, I was cooking rice-- [Researcher] We tested\ndifferent questions-- [Speaker] And some people...(people chattering)(sighs) Man, I love TikTokand all short-form video that\nI consume to cure my boredom.(Johnny chuckles)And to be clear,this video will critique all of thisand tell us about how the brain\nis kinda getting messed upwith some of this stuff.But boy, it's fun while it lasts.Anyway, this device is very\nuseful for curing my boredomand I use it Saturdays at 3:00 PMwhen I'm feeling bored.And yes, later I will show you the studiesthat unpack boredom and phone use.But for now, I was actually curiousif other people experience\nthis the way I dobecause it's a deeply personal\nand emotional experience.And so I asked my team.- So I usually get bored\nwhen I get home from workand I've done all of the\nthings that I wanted to do,like eat dinner, hang out with friends,go to the gym, do a hobby,and there's still time left over.Somehow I get this really\nuncomfortable feeling,which is boredom.That's this like existential gut punch.And I think about, \"What\nam I doing with my life?\"And I want to crawl out of my own skin.Typically, I will numb it with TikTokor playing video games,but sometimes I will sit in it,sit in the discomfort\nand think about my life.But that is a lot more\nwork and exhausting.- Ironically, though, I have\nnoticed that I find my phoneto be a sort of boring\nreplacement for the boredom.There is this sort of\ninstant gratificationwith social media that feels\nlike it's the addictive versionof boredom,and yeah, that is kind of scary.(VHS clicks)\n(bright string music)- Okay, before we get\nback to the car analogy,which is very good and\nvery useful, I promise.I want to explain what\nI've learned about why.Why does boredom even\nexist inside of our brains?And it turns outthat it's actually a very\nnatural biological signalthat we developed a long time ago.What's happening when\nwe're bored is a bunchof brain regions are\ncoming together to tell usthat we need to do something\ndifferent with our situation.One of the defining\ntraits of human beings isthat we are restless.We need purpose and meaning\nto fuel our actions.And this has been one way\nthat humans have been pushedto create and change\ntheir natural situation,not just for more resources\nlike all animals do,but also in search of meaning\nwhere these self-aware apeswho are able to tell stories of meaningand purpose to each other,and we ourselves are kind of\ncharacters in our own story.It's a major reasonwhy humans have been able to\ncooperate in large numberswith each other,looking towards stories like\ncorporations or religions,or countries.All of these are meaningful\nstories that bind us togetherto cooperate and change our situation.So a lot of experts now thinkthat boredom is this emotional\ncue that is pushing usto do something different with our lives,to deliver on that need for meaning.But boredom today is pretty different.In fact, in the old days,most people didn't have time to get bored.- It's typical for traditional societiesthat you don't have to spend\na lot of time thinking aboutwhat to care aboutbecause it's already defined for you.- Let's do one of my\nfavorite things and rewind,and see what my little road trip analogywould've looked like if\nI lived 500 years ago.So I'm a farmer.Most of us would've been farmers, FYI.And I spend most of my\ntime working on the farm,because if I don't,my family and I will die.So my attention is locked into kind of one high-stakes\nactivity that defines my life.Let's look down at my meaning\nand purpose fuel tank.Oh whoa, it's doing great.And look, you can see why.Here on the farm,my sense of purpose and\nmeaning flows in abundancefrom my family,my belonging to a community\nin which I was bornthat has well-defined culture and ritualsthat my ancestors have been\ndoing for thousands of years.And perhaps most of all,I have a clear existential\nstory in the form of religion.This makes death and suffering not so badand it fills me with a bigger purpose.This stuff is like rocket\nfuel for our sense of meaningand belonging, and purpose.Now it doesn't mean life was easy.Not at all.But it does mean that we didn't get bored.We didn't have time to get boredand we didn't have any lack\nof meaning and purpose.It was all kind of automated\nfor us by our culture.- I think that the experienceof boredom was certainly\nthere in traditionalor pre-modern societies,but it really gains traction in modernity.- The world has maybe not been aroundas long as we might imagine,but that doesn't mean that the\nconcept and the experience,and the feeling isn't ancient.- Boredom was more of a privilegefor those who were the royal courts,the clergy and so on.- Rich aristocrats were\nthe rare human beingsthat had time on their hands.The other group were monkswho had quite a bit of\ntime before the rest of us,and in fact,they had a word to describe\nthis feeling of boredom,called it acedia,a lack of motivation to\nfulfill your purpose,or in this case, your duties to God.Christians would frame this\nearly concept of boredomas a dangerous sin that\ncould kill your faith.They would nickname it\n\"The Noonday Demon,\"the most dangerous of all the demonsbecause from boredom stemmed\nmany other sinful behaviors,and they were kind of onto somethingas we will see in the\nscientific literature very soon.French monks updated the interpretationto a desire to escape the present,a tiredness and a hunger for variety.But then you get to like the 1600s,and things start to\nchange, at least in Europe,as people move to cities.They're working in factories.They're doing repetitive work.They have less and less freedom\nand autonomy, and purpose,and they're getting bored.- The words for boredom\nin different languages.For the most part, they\npop up in the 17th century,around there in most languages.- You can see this in the peoplewho have tracked all the etymologyand these words that have been\nused in different languages.Here's the usage in Spanish over time.Here is the French, German,and here it is in English.People start to use the verb boreas a verb in letters and\nliterature in the late 1700s,back when London looked like this.- Needed words to describe an emotionthat had become quite a lot\nmore common in modernity.Boredom became available for everybody.It became democratized.- Okay, the history part's over.Now let's look at this part of the graph.This rise.Boredom is surging,and kind of weird because\nit's surging at a timewhen we have like more\namazing, exciting experiencesand content to watch than ever before.That is the mystery at\nthe heart of this video.And one I promise I will\nanswer before we are done.(VHS clicks)\n(inquisitive music)Okay, well, one thing is for certain,my life does not look like this anymore.We're not on the farm anymore filledwith meaning from our\nculture and religion.First off, our map is kind of fullof way more possibilities.We're not just going in\none predetermined pathof a million possible routes.And look at my purpose\nfuel tank down here.I've lost some very\nimportant sources of meaning.I don't have religion anymore,which is a huge hit to my sense of purposeand higher meaning.I'm a transplant in a big city,in a highly individualistic country.So I don't have anywhere\nnear the sense of communityand old culture that my ancestors had.This may be different for youif you live in a small\ntown in Europe or Vietnam,and you are continuing traditions\nthat your ancestors did.My ancestors left their traditionsand came to a new world to start new.So yeah, I lost that part.Now I do have family\nthat is a massive sourceof very deep meaning for me,but if I wanna fill my tank with meaning,I gotta kind of do it on my own.I have to create my own\nsense of purpose and meaning,which, to be clear, is\na really great thing.Like I get to determine\nhow I live my life,how I raise my kids,what I do religiously or not religiously.Community and what people\nI invite into my community.That sense of freedom is wonderful.My point here is that a lot\nof us don't have our senseof meaning and purpose\nsort of automated for uslike our ancestors did,and that is a major\nreason why we get bored.Oh, and not to mentionthat our meaning tanks are now much largerand our expectations kind\nof full all of the time.- We expect, or could\nperhaps even say demand,that lives should be filled to the brimwith meaning at all occasions.We have very little\ntolerance for these gapsof emptiness in our existence,in which nothing really happens.We're having trouble dealing with those.- Pair that with the fact\nthat there's been an assaulton my attention abilities,thanks to all these flashing\nbuttons and viral videos.And you can see why\nsometimes this happens.(audio warbling)\n(pensive music)The car goes dark.It's 3:00 PM on a Saturday and I'm stuck.I don't have the attention and\nthe purpose to go anywhere.I'm bored and it feels pretty horrible.Okay, this is the most\nimportant part of the video,I would say,because I just spent all this\ntime giving you the history,building this car analogy.But the car analogy\nreally starts to pay offfrom here forward.And this is the part of the videowhere we see how boredom can be good,how this can actually be a hopeful thing.It's not all bad.It can actually be the\nmost important thingfor helping you live a\nmore meaningful life.So let me show you.(VHS clicks)\n(inquisitive music)Okay, so I'm bored.I'm stuck without meaningand the ability to pay\nattention to anything.And for those who need a\nquick 45-second groundingin the actual neuroscienceso that you don't think\nI'm just winging itwith this analogy.Here it goes.When scientists put people in a roomand make them watch a\nboring video like this oneof two guys hanging laundry,the participants' brains look like this.I should have printed it in color,but probably seen it\nin color on your video.Lucky you.Boredom.That's what your brain looks\nlike when you're bored.It activates all of these regionsthat are associated with\ndaydreaming, mind wandering,and thinking about the past and future.Nostalgia.Something I'm very into, actually.Look at this.This is a brain that is in big\npicture, mind wandering mode,default mode network is\ntechnically what it's called.But if you go deeper into\nthe center of the brain,you will see that the part\nof the brain that drives meto pay attention, to make\ndecisions, is anti-correlated.It's kind of turned off, it's not in sync.So I'm feeling all nostalgic\nabout my life storyand the meaning behind everything,but it's paired with this\ninability to channel my attentionto make decisions that\nare meaningful to me.Learning all of this was\nactually very helpful for meto understandwhy my 3:00 PM Saturday boredom\nis so existential feeling.It actually feels like really terrible.I'm like, I start to question everything.I'm thinking about my past, my future.I now understand why.Now there's way more\nscience and study on this.I'm gonna leave all the\nsources in the sources docthat is in the description.But just know that my\ncar analogy is groundedin all of this.Let's get back to the car.So we're here in the\ndark car, we're bored.We're out of gas.Now let's look what people do\nwhen they're in this state.You can do a few things.Number one is you can become really meanon the relation of boredom\nand sadistic aggression.It's a great paper.So one cure for boredom is sadism,defined here as harming\nothers for pleasure.For some reason,the moment you decide to do harm,look what happens to your car.It revs back up.\n(engine revs)And weirdly, our purpose\ntank gets really full.Our attention fires up.Our car is running again.We turn down this sketchy road\nwhere we snap at our partneror yell at our kids with\nthe intent to hurt them.We get online and we\nstart stirring people up.We make them angry with\nbad faith critiques,trying to inflame them,\ntrying to hurt them.This is one that I'm familiar with,not doing it but receiving it.While this is happening,look at the purpose fuel tank.It is full to the brim.Ah, so the monks were right.There is a noonday demon within boredom.The way this looks in the studies isthat they put people at a table with wormsand a coffee grinder.Bored people are more\nlikely to take these wormsand grind them up in the coffee grinderfor no other reason other\nthan to cure their boredom.And they even gave these\nworms names to humanize themso that it would kind\nof seem even more cruel.Names like Toto, Tifi, Kiki.Oh, and if you're\nconcerned about the worms,the coffee grinders were fake.The worms didn't actually die,but the participants didn't know that.In other studies,bored people are more\nlikely to take away moneyfrom random people that\nthey don't even know.Not because they gained anything,just because they were boredand being mean helped take the edge off.Now these studies do have some caveats,like some people have a\nhigher propensity to be boredor some people have a higher\npropensity to be sadistic.But even controlling for that,when you and I, all of us,the general person is bored,we are more likely to\nengage in sadistic behavior,to harm others for pleasure.I mean, this is kind of well-known.You see headlines every once\nin a while of like destructive,terrible things that have\nhappened because, quote,\"someone was bored,\"a search for meaning\nand a lack of mobility,to create that meaning leads peopleto turn to destruction.Sometimes self-destruction is one studywhere people will sit around,and instead of just sit and be bored,they will zap themselves, hurt themselves.- Even when the only\noption is to do somethingthat you don't like, that's\npotentially harmful to you,you'll go ahead and do it anywayas a preference over doing nothing.- This can manifest in other\nkinds of self-harm for peoplewho are bored,who are looking for a physical sensationto help distract themfrom the very uncomfortable mental painthat comes with boredom.It has the function to avoidor escape from aversive\nemotional experiences.Okay, but,this is like the dark side of boredom,you have another choice.Here's the hopeful side of boredom.Rewind the clock.Get me back to being\nbored in that dark carbefore the trolling being mean\nto my kids and partner began.Here we go. We're stuck here.Instead of revving your car\nup with that demonic fuelthat we just saw,you can do the much harder thing.You can get out of the car and push it.You can push it down a roadthat you know contains\nsome meaningful experience.Here I am pushing mine towards,\ngoing on a walk in nature.It's actually a lot of effort.I do not want to do this by\ndefinition because I am bored.I am manually pushing it,but as I push, my mind is kind\nof in this big picture place.Remember the default mode network?I'm thinking about the pastand the future about\nthe meaning of my life.I'm feeling thingsand reading my thoughtsin a way that I usually don't get to.And look what happens when I get close.(engine whirs)\n(engine purrs)This worked.My car fires back up,and yes, it took some effort,but my purpose tank is filling up.My attention and my abilityto keep it is flickering back on.I'm going back to things\nthat bring me purposewithout having to harm anyone.And in fact, the benefit of all of this isI'm now more in touch with my\nsense of meaning and purposebecause I've had to sit with it.I've had to struggle\nthrough not feeling itand contemplate what meaning is for me.What do I actually want\nto do with my life?So I get back in the carand I'm rethinking my route on this map,what turns I want to take.And to stretch this analogy even further,I'm stronger.I'm stronger because I\ngot out and pushed my car,so like my muscles are stronger.Next time I get bored,I have the mental muscles to push through.And this is why some studies, not all,demonstrate a statistically\nsignificant correlationbetween boredom and creativity.Being bored makes you more creativeaccording to some of these studies,which gets to answering\nanother question I've hadfor a long time, which is,why some cultures have entire conceptsthat embrace this idea of boredom?(Johnny speaks in foreign language)Is an Italian phrase that translatesinto the sweetness of doing nothing.The Dutch have this word niksen,I think that's how you say it,which is like the verb to nothing.The practice of intentionally\nembracing a state of boredomand seeing the benefits from it.There's an entire religion,or spiritual tradition, I guess, Daoism,that is dedicated to embracing non-actionin the name of realigning your actionsin harmony with your values.And remember, our biology\ngave us boredom for a reason.It's a very important part of being humanswho are driven by meaningand who are always looking for waysto chase after what is meaningful to them.- Living with it,dealing with it actually creates a spacein which you can actually have\nan encounter with yourself.You can actually be in your own companyand not just the company\nof everybody else.- Okay, but I always get annoyedwhen people conclude that the answer isto embrace the discomfort.Just embrace it, and that's\nas simple as it can be.I'm not gonna do thatbecause, in this case, I\nthink there are actual tipsthat I think are helping\nme as I practice them,and that could help you too.And it is not become more\nenlightened and embrace Daoism.That might work for you,but for the rest of us,we are putting together a guide of tipson how to manage boredom,and I will get to that in a sec.But first,I want to show you the last\nreally important part of this.The answer to why we've got this graph.Boredom is on the rise,not just here,but kind of in lots of\ndifferent countries.It's sort of a paradox because\nwe're at a time of lifewhere there's more exciting\ncontent and experiences,and freedom, and opportunity\nthan ever before.Why is this happening?Well, we've already\nanswered part one of that,which is we have less\ninherent meaning in our livesbecause we've moved awayfrom some of these\ncollective sources of meaninglike religion, community\nritual, et cetera.But the other part is somethingyou're also probably very familiar with.Let me show you.Okay, let's get back\nto the bored dark car,clear out all this\nwholesome meaning stuff.Let's get back to one more\nscenario of what we can dowhen I'm sitting here\nquestioning my existence.I've got this other option,and damn, it's a good option.(people chattering)Oh, and before you think\nI'm gonna get all judgyand start condemning\nyou for using your phoneor watching Netflix,I'm not. That would be dumb.I'm not gonna do that.This is our lives.I'm literally a person who\nmakes content for the internet.I'm addicted to social media\nand TV just like you are.That's fine.I'm not a zealotand I'm not gonna judge anyone.But now that I've read all the literature,I do want to let you in on\nwhat happens when the phoneand the scrolling turns into\nour medicine for boredom.Okay, the car's back on. We're moving.Let's look at the meaning tank here.Okay, so it's Saturday,\n3:00 PM, I'm bored,but look, my car's back on,scrolling some YouTube\nShorts here and we're moving.My meaning tank isn't full,but there's enough for the car to go.But wait, something's off here.Oh, look, my attention\nheadlights aren't even working.They're not pointed at the road.I can't really tell where I'm going.Ah, I see why.All my attention power is being usedto power my phone.This is what I am paying attention to.So my car is driving, I'm moving,but I'm sort of just\ndriving in a straight line.There's kind of a sense of\nmeaning and entertainment,but I get the sense that I'm\nnot totally choosing thisas I scroll.Oh yes, look over here.I've pressed cruise control, autopilot.I'm not hurting anyone.\nI'm not an internet troll.I'm not in that demonic mode.I'm not on some sketchy street somewhere,but I'm also not using\nboredom to do the hard workof reassessing my route.I'm just going straight.I'm on cruise control,which, again, is fine.(chuckles) Like after a week of work,I'm not interested in\nlike reassessing my life.I want to decompress.I want to hit cruise control\nand I want to sit back,and I want to passively be\ngiven a sense of meaningabout the story that\nI'm watching on Netflixor the Instagram, whatever.That is a way that we decompress.Stories.People have been doing it forever.I know I've said this,but the last thing we\nneed is more judgy energyaround this stuff.But what happens if phones and scrollingbecome the medicine I\nuse every time I'm bored?Well, there are good\nstudies around this now.First, what they're\nfinding, unsurprisingly,is that people are more\nand more using their phonesto cure the feeling of boredom.I mean, yeah, that makes total sense.You're bored waiting\nfor a train or whatever,you pull out your phone.What this means is that you\nnever get out to push your car.You never sit in the default\nmode network and push your car,and assess your life,and do the uncomfortable thingof thinking big about\nthe future and the past.This cruise control is kind\nof like a nice morphine dripinto our purpose tank.We don't ever need to\nget out and push the car,and do the big mind wandering\nthing that leads us sometimesto more creative or meaningful actions.And according to this one study,what they're finding\nis that evidence showsthat digital media,rather than reducing our\nboredom or like satiating it,it actually increases it.So to push our analogy\nto its absolute limits.Not only does the phone never\ngive us a chance to break downand reassess our route,but it actually makes us\nmore likely to break down.It's as if the fuelthat we get from this is\nlike this radioactive goothat creates a leak in our fuel tank.So it runs out quicker and\nwe break down more often.We get bored more often,which in turn leads us to\ngrab our phone to satiateor get rid of our boredom.Psychologists called this a vicious cyclebetween boredom and phones.Now look, I knew phones were addictive.I've read all this stuff, the dopamine.We all know this is happening,but I didn't know this\nwhen I got into this story.I didn't realizethis natural psychological\ncue called boredom,that has a lot to do\nwith my mind's abilityto make meaning and purpose,is being totally messed withbecause of my propensity to\ngrab the phone to cure it,which makes me more likely to get bored,which makes me more\nlikely to grab my phone.Like I didn't realize that that existed,and it's actually blowing my mind.Okay, so to recap,you get bored, you have three options.Go down the demonic route, start\nto hurt people and be mean.Go down the constructive route,do the hard work of sitting with it.Let your mind drift into broad, creative,nostalgic thinking, even\nthough it's uncomfortable.Or take the middle road,\nturn on cruise control,and take neither route,kind of numb the whole system.The last question I want to try to answeror start to answer is,okay, so what do we do?This exists.Phones aren't going away.I'm not getting rid of\nmy phone anytime soon.How do I manage boredom in a modern world?That's the last section of this video.(VHS clicks)\n(inquisitive music)So if you clicked on this videobecause you wanted to\nlearn about the historyand neuroscience of boredom,and you yourself have no\ninterest in figuring outhow to manage your own boredom,then now is the time for you to click awayand go find something else to do.The rest of us,I want to take the rest of this videoto go through some really specific tipsthat I've been practicing and exploring,and that the research points toas ways that we can manage our boredom.It'll all be documented in\nthe link in the description.So you don't even have to watch this,you can just click that and\nread through it briefly.But for those who want,\nlet me talk you through it.Number one, look at it.I'm not gonna go all new age on you,but I am going to say\nthat the most effective,most powerful, subtle thing\nthat you can do is recognizewhat it feels like to be bored\nthe next time you're bored.Try to notice your mind going\ninto a more existential modewhere you're thinking about\nthe past and the future.At first, it's just\ngonna feel like a jumbleand a cloud of uncomfortable feeling.But with time, even if\nyou just take a minutebefore you intervene and do anything,just to notice,you will refine that sense of\nbeing able to see the boredom.Oh, and you kind of have to\ndo this without judging it,like without like\ngetting down on yourself.Just like let it happen. Look at it.There's actually a ton of sciencearound this very simple techniquethat is called mindfulness.It applies to all kinds\nof mental experiences,but it really applies to\nthis boredom situation.There's a million ways to\nformally practice this.Like a million apps, Headspace,the Waking Up app of Sam Harris,a million YouTube videos, whatever.But you can also just\ninformally try it outnext time you're having\nan uncomfortable feeling.Try to look at it instead of avoid it.Number two, and this is also\ngonna sound kind of new agey,but I promise it's also very\nuseful is work on accepting it.Meaning, going through the process ofinstead of trying to avoid it,embracing it and saying,\"This is what is happening right now.\"And even saying this is\nwhat helps for me is like,this is actually a good thing.This is my body telling me\nsomething about my life.I'm going to actually try to accept itinstead of trying to resist it.- The $64,000 question about boredomthat everybody wants to know is,what do I do about it?How do I eliminate it?And there are lots of\ndifferent responses to that.I think the first one is to\nsay you can't eliminate it.Boredom, if it's something\nthat plays a role in your life,if it's functional,then you don't want to\nget rid of it, right?Because you want that function.- Another way to put\nthis is relax into it.Relaxation is kind of the\nopposite of boredom in some ways.Relaxation is an acceptance of non-action.What I do is I kind of go\nback to these brain scansand I think of like the nostalgic,like thinking about\nthe past and the futureand try to say like,\n\"Oh, my brain is goingthrough this default mode network thing,and that's kind of cool.I'm gonna just relax into itinstead of judge myself\nthat I'm feeling it.Okay, so those are the\nfirst kind of micro actionsthat you can take inside of your mindnext time you feel bored,and those sort of set the stagefor managing your boredom.If you do those two, then\nyou'll be in a better placeto engage with the rest of\nthe things on this list,which are things that\nare scientifically provento help you fill this tank of meaning,which is core to us\nfeeling regulated and good.So that leads us to engage inwhat the scientists call\npro-social behavior,which means just hanging out with people.So much of human meaning\ncomes from relationships,connection with others,helping other people happens\nto be a very potent fuelfor this sense of meaning and purpose.And for the introverts out there,it doesn't have to be\nlike a heart-to-heart,hour-long conversation with somebody.It can be like going to an eventwhere there's a bunch of\nother people, group rituals,festivals, sporting events,\nconcerts, political rallies.These are a fast track to feelingsome kind of collective meaningwith your fellow human beings.I think other animals like dogs and cats,and pets also can fulfill\na version of this as well.We're gonna put some links\nin this boredom guideof a platform where you can\nfind different communitiesand meetups,as well as this cool blog postof \"99 Ways to Find IRL Community.\"Okay, the next one, get creative.Humans are artistic, creative beings,and turns out that being\ncreative, making stuff,fills our tank.And as the science\nsays, when we are bored,we are actually uniquely\nplaced to be more creative,to think differently than we normally do.The literature talks a lot\nabout like mastery and practice,like practicing piano every day.That's a little high effort for this.I'm more so thinking low effort, low cost,like high reward creativity.Cook something.Do some basic crocheting or knitting,origami, adult coloring\nbooks, mood boards, collages,finger painting.Like it doesn't have to be\ngood, no one has to see it,but the act of making something\nis a source of meaningand a great way to like\nleverage your boredomfor something creative.The next one is near and dear to my heart,which is get curious.Curiosity and enthusiasm about\nsomething is a deep sourceof meaning for a lot of people.This is actually like the core.For me, besides my family,this is where I get most\nof my meaning in life.Nerding out about stuff.There's this quote from Andy Warhol.\"You need to let the little thingsthat would ordinarily bore\nyou suddenly thrill you.\"I mean easier said than done, Andy,but like try to find\nthings that light you up.Whether it's like obsessing over the specsof trains in Europeor looking into how ants\nbuild ant colonies, whatever.Finding something that\nyou can nerd out aboutand obsess over can be\nreally good for meaningand a cure for boredom.Going down the old Wikipedia\nrabbit hole works every time.If you cultivate this enough,you get access to the inverse of boredom,which is called flow,where you are so deeply engrossed\nin what you are learningor doing that you kind\nof forget everything.It's like your attention and\nmeaning are just on turbo driveand you can kind of just go for hours.Okay, next one is going outside.This is, again, well-documented\nin the literature.Wandering through a forest,as wonders to our sense\nof awe and perspective,and meaning.You're also moving your bodyand going through a walk in nature.And often,you can find activities\nthat blend a bunch of these.Like if you go out\nbirdwatching or somethingwith somebody else,you are doing the social thing,you are doing the nerd\nout about something thing,and you're doing like the go\non a walk in nature thing.Go to a painting class,you're doing mastery in practice,but you're also doing creativity,\nyou're also doing social.So anyway, all this is in\nthe guide in the description,and I also want to kind of\nhear from all of you like,what does boredom feel like for youand what do you do when you are bored?I would love the comment\nsection to turn into a discoursearound the experience of\nboredom for different people.So please do that.So I just want to finish by reemphasizingwhat we started with,which is that boredom is not bad.It is a very natural cue\nthat our body has given usto spur us to action,to let us think about what\nis meaningful in our livesand to help us assess\nour story through life.And in this world where\nmeaning is not made for uslike the old days,and we have these phones that\nkind of sabotage our abilityto sit with ourselves,learning to sit with and\naccept boredom is a skill.It is one that you must practiceif you want to leverage its benefits.So I know that this story has\nbeen quite impactful for mein how I approach my bored moments,and I hope it can do some\nversion of the same for you.And I really look forward\nto hearing from all of youdown in the comments.Thanks for watching.I'll see you in the next one.(gentle piano music)",
    "summary": "This YouTube video, \"Why Everything Is Making You Feel Bored,\" explores the rising prevalence of boredom, particularly in an era saturated with content and experiences. The narrator argues that boredom isn't trivial but rather a painful emotion signaling a lack of meaning and purpose. Using an analogy of life as a road trip, he explains that attention (headlights) and a sense of meaning (fuel tank) are crucial for navigating life. Boredom arises when this \"fuel tank\" is empty, hindering one's ability to focus and find fulfillment. The video also touches upon the modern assault on attention spans due to constant stimulation from digital devices, which can exacerbate feelings of boredom. The video is sponsored by Incogni, a service that helps remove personal data from data brokers, an indirect solution to reducing the noise that impacts attention.\n\nThe video reveals a surprising perspective: boredom can be a catalyst for a more purposeful and creative life. It delves into neuroscience, explaining that boredom activates brain regions associated with daydreaming and introspection, prompting a re-evaluation of one's life path. While some may resort to destructive or sadistic behaviors as a means to escape boredom, the video advocates for a more constructive approach: actively engaging with the discomfort, pushing through it, and seeking out meaningful experiences like spending time in nature or connecting with others. The video then explains the vicious cycle of boredom and phone use, where scrolling provides temporary relief but ultimately diminishes one's ability to engage in meaningful self-reflection, thereby increasing susceptibility to boredom.\n\nFinally, the video offers practical tips for managing boredom, including cultivating mindfulness, accepting the feeling without judgment, engaging in pro-social behavior, fostering creativity, and nurturing curiosity. The underlying message is that boredom, though unpleasant, serves an essential purpose in prompting self-reflection and guiding individuals towards a more fulfilling existence. By recognizing boredom's significance and actively addressing its root causes, one can harness its potential to live a more meaningful and creative life in the modern world."

    "transcript": "Okay, so you're told to get a degree,learn to code, memorize facts, andfollow the rules. So far, that'ssupposed to be the formula for success,right? Well, I'm not sosure. You see, while millions ofstudents in India are still beingtrained the same old way we were trained30 years ago, I think AI is quietlychanging the rules of the game. Tounderstand just how badly we aremisaligned, let's talk about coffee.[Music]See, you walk into a Starbucks, you buya latte, and you drink it. Seems prettysimple, right? But beneath thatsimplicity lies one of the mostintricate, globally coordinated systemsin human history. And it's very relevantto how you should think about life andcareers. Think about it. A coffee storedoesn't really need to grow coffeebeans, milk cows, or build coffeemachines. It simply needs to wrapeverything underneath into a simpleproduct you can buy. That's becausecoffee stores like Starbucks depend on alarge network of suppliers who movethese coffee beans from one place toanother. Starbucks may make coffee beanstoday, but many other coffee stores relyon other people and other institutions.Now, these suppliers themselves don'tgrow coffee beans either. They alsodepend on something more complex. Amassive shipment network that movesgoods across countries and continents.Go one step lower and you'll find localfactories that manufacture, process, andpackage these goods before they're evenready to ship. But even these factoriesdon't produce anything from scratch.They depend on something much deeper,the people growing these raw materials.Now, let's call this entire system astack. Each layer in the stack dependson the one below it. Starbucks can'tsell coffee without its supply chain.The supply chain can't function withoutshipping. Shipping can't exist withoutfactories. And none of it would bepossible without the people at thebottom. And yet, when you order coffee,you don't think about any of this.That's because by design, Starbucks hasto wrap all the complexity into onesimple transaction. And that's exactlywhat a wrapper is. It takes somethingcomplicated, hides all the layersbeneath it, and it turns it intosomething easy to use. And it's alsovery important for the way you thinkabout life and careers. Now, let's turnto software.Kids these days see something built ontop of existing software and startlaughing and they say, \"Oh, this is justa rapper.\" As if it somehow makes itless valuable. As if React, Python orC++ aren't rappers themselves. Learninga specific language or a framework at avery specific abstraction level andbelieving that you have figured outeverything and dismissing everythingbelow or above the abstraction level isnot a good sign of deeper understanding.It's actually a surface level take.Think about it. No one cancels Starbucksfor not growing its own coffee beans. Noone looks at Uber and says, \"Oh, that'sjust a wrapper around car owners.\" Andyet, when it comes to software, peoplesuddenly forget how value is created.This is the kind of status game thatmisunderstands how the economy works.Because in reality, value doesn't reallycome from originality, but howaccessible, simple, and useful somethingis. How much you are abstracting awaythe complexity is important. But thismindset around cancelelling rappersisn't just an internet opinion. It's asymptom of a much deeper problem. And itdidn't just come out of nowhere. Itstarted in our schools. We were toldthat copying is bad and that beingoriginal is everything. For a decade,there were countries we looked at and wesaid, \"Hey, these people only makecopies of everything.\" Until the pointwhere they started making better thingsthan the people they were copying. Thebuilding on top of someone else's ideawas somehow cheating or immoral. Eventhough the entire economy is that. So,of course, now when people see otherpeople building on top of somethingexisting, some existing tool or someexisting model, they roll their eyes anddismiss it as just a rapper. Andhonestly, it's not even their fault.They were systematically trained tothink that way. Instead of encouragingcreativity by using the things that areavailable to you and modifying it inmany ways, schools told us to memorizefacts, follow instructions, chasegrades, and never pushed for deeperunderstanding. Our understanding ofunderstanding is a very viva-likeunderstanding of understanding whichmeans that you go you're able to answera bunch of questions like a rapid fireor quiz round but you're not actuallyable to build anything and because of itour generation neither learned to graspnuance and complexity nor did it evenattempt to. Now this mindset would haveworked 20 years ago though when youcouldn't just Google anything andmemorizing did give you an edge. If youcouldn't Google something and no oneelse had that information but it was inyour head, then well, you did have anadvantage. You knew something otherpeople didn't and that information wasimportant. But the times have changed.Information is freely available on theinternet now. Specific information foryou from an AI model for the exactproblem that you have in a fewmilliseconds. And therefore, we need tochange the mindset of what is valuableand important too. But actually, it'salways been like this. Sure, whileknowledge has been valuable, I thinkabstracting, which is moving awaycomplexity beneath the surface andgiving one quality product in one singletransaction to a customer has alwaysbeen important. So before we go anyfurther, let's try and understand why itwas always important because the systemthat actually encodes this and thatsystem is[Music]capitalism. So my viewpoint around thisis that capitalism is just a stack ofrappers. See, capitalism isn't actuallyabout hard work or making money. I knowyou're going to scream at me. You'regoing to be like, \"No, but capitalism isall about money.\" No, not really. Thinkabout your phone. Every time you send atext, you're not worrying about signalsbouncing between cell towers or datapackets traveling through optical fibersacross continents. You just type and hitsend. That's because your phone itselfis a wrapper. Not just around a bunch oftechnology from different places, butalso around the entiretelecommunications infrastructure. Notjust your phone. Everything around youis a rapper. Your car is a wrapperaround engines. Netflix is a wrapperaround broadcasting networks. And evenGoogle search is a wrapper around theinternet. Now, each of these productshas a stack of its own. So, let's zoomout. Imagine not just one but millionsof such stacks all interconnected andrelying on each other to make trade,markets, and entire industries possible.That is what capitalism really is. Whenyou make a cup of coffee, when you use,you know, one of those coffee mixes, youhave no idea who the people are whoactually grew the beans, and they don'tknow who you are, and they don't know alot of parts in the shipping chaineither. But they all do their jobswithout sometimes knowing who the endcustomer is going to be. But schoolsnever explained it this way. Instead,they made it sound like this grandabstract machine that runs on its own.It actually runs on all of us. We runit. It's human nature and behavior andour ability to coordinate that run it.But in reality, it's just rappers allthe way down. And the truth is,capitalism wouldn't exist without suchrappers. But I think a lot of peopledon't understand how the real worldworks. So they oversimplify. They seebillionaires and they think it's eitherpure luck or exploitation. But what theydon't see is the invisible architecture.They don't see that people who buildbillion-dollar businesses aren't theones memorizing facts or doing thefoundational work. They're actually theones building the biggest rappersbecause there's actually no such thingas foundational work. Everything, eventhe foundational work, depends on otherfoundations. And as a result, the worldrewards them massively. And it onlymakes sense. See, these people who youthink are making a lot of money,actually the people on top, the rappermost test of rappers, right? What's thedifference between them and the layersbelow? They are more exposed to thegeneral consumer. The players on top ofthe stack are B2C businesses, which isthey work with consumers directly. Theytake the most risk. They handleconsumers saying good things about them,bad things about them, talking aboutthem on Reddit, all that stuff. Theyabsorb all of this. They wrap thecomplexity of the layers below and turnit into something easy, usable, andaccessible to the end consumer. Andbecause of it, they create the mostvalue for themselves and capture themost money. But they also absorb themost risk. Because if you play one leveldown, let's say you're a provider forone of these consumer businesses, you'rea B2B business. Let's say you're AWS andyou're just providing cloud services. Itis a much lower risk business. You maynot capture as much value as like thebiggest mobile phone business, butyou're still critical and you'reprotected from a lot of the risk ofgoing straight to consumer. The lowerdown the rapper you go, let's say someperson who's shipping uh you know actualhardware devices from one place toanother that the servers can use, thatperson is most protected from theconsumer. They only have to keep onecustomer or a bunch of customers happy.But the topmost rappers don't justcreate the most value or capture themost money. They also keep the stackalive. Think about it. Consumers payStarbucks. Starbucks pays suppliers.Suppliers pay shippers. Shippers paymanufacturers. And manufacturers payfarmers. At every step, money tricklesdown the stack, incentivizing everylayer to do what they do best, but alsoreducing the risk. The higher up you go,there's risk. The lower up you go,there's lesser risk. And by risk, I meanexposure to direct consumers. There's alot of business owners that say this,right? Which is exposure to the marketsdirectly is like exposure topsychopathy. You have no idea whatthey're going to wake up and thinkbecause it's all driven by vibes andemotions. Unlike a farmer who simplygrows coffee or a shipper who simplyships goods, Starbucks has much more atstake. One bad quarter and all of thenews will be talking about how theirstock has dipped. A failed productlaunch and lots of employees will quit.But this isn't anything new. This is howprogress has always been. Every timetechnology has advanced, people havestepped up, taken risks, and found a wayto build something on top of existingtechnologies and created the most value.And the reason I'm telling you all ofthis is because after AI, all of thisbecomes even moreimportant. Now, remember I told you thatevery layer is dependent on the layerbelow it. But actually, every layer isalso dependent on the number of peopleyou can hire and all of their knowledgeand all of their intelligence and all oftheir experience. Most people think AIis some unstoppable force that will takeover everything. But really, it's justanother layer in the stack that wrapscomplexity and makes things easier touse. AI itself is a rapper. If you thinkabout how AI works, it's only replacingpeople who are not very good at whatthey do. But the people who arereasonably good at what they do areactually using AI to do a lot more thanthey could traditionally do. You can doprogramming, you can do design, you cando writing. You're better at everythingas a go. Instead of now hiring fivepeople at your layer and being able toprovide some service to somebody, you'renow able to use just these tools. It'skind of changing how capitalism works.See, a lot of people feel that using AIfor something is cheating because itfeels like you're using somebody else'swork. It feels like using a systemthat's making all of the things, all thecraft that you the effort that you spendputting into something, it kind of makesit useless. It feels like you you're notreally doing anything. But if you'venoticed the world around you a littlebit, you realize that society has alwaysworked that way. In fact, society hasonly rewarded people who built somethinguseful. Whether it was Facebook copyingMySpace and Friendster or Googlebuilding its search engine on top of theopen web, society has only rewardedthem. Use what society gives you. Addmore value and make that convenient forthe end consumer to transact with. Wealways had a finance system. Why did UPIwork? It just made it so convenient. No,it wrapped on top of such a complexsystem that we already had. If you're asoftware engineer and you think thespecific part of the stack that you workon is the most important stack andanyone building on top is a just awrapper builder. Let me give you anexample. Imagine I dropped you on anisland and asked you to build an appfrom scratch. Let's say you love usingReact. So, first you need React. ButReact can't do anything since it's justa wrapper around JavaScript. So, youneed JavaScript first. But JavaScriptitself runs on engines like V8 which arewritten on top of C++. And C++ is builton top of C. To make matters worse, Cdoesn't run by itself. It's compileddown to assembly. And assembly is alsojust a wrapper around raw machine code.Let's assume you somehow figured out onthat island how to code in binary. Well,wait. You don't even have a computer. Sonow you need to build one. And for thatyou need a processor, which means youneed to extract silicon from sand. Butyou don't even have electricity or afactory. So maybe you need to start byrubbing two stones together and creatingfire first. Let's also somehow assumeyou managed to build a computer fromscratch. What about the operatingsystem? You need to write an operatingsystem from scratch. But how are yougoing to write that when you don't evenhave a keyboard or a screen? Think aboutwhat an awesome world we live in thatall these abstractions exist. Nobodystarts from scratch. Everyone isstanding on thousands of years of humaninvention. And funny enough, nobodywrites assembly today. But I wrote it incollege. But even then I was relying ona computer built by somebody else. Andthat's the thing, every modern toolexists because of countless layers ofinventions that came before it. Not justphysical inventions, but a lot ofknowledge that's in people's brains.While the inventions already exist inthe real world, and now we can buy themfor cheap because commoditization hashappened. And you can buy a computer forreally cheap compared to what it cost 30years ago. The knowledge is availablefor free with AI or nearly free with AI.And that's what people miss. Theunderlying work doesn't disappear. It'sstill there. It's just that rappers takecare of the lower level stuff so you canfocus on the higher level creativestuff. And if you feel AI has taken oversome level or some layer, there arelayers on top. The transaction is thefinallayer. Every time a new rapper hasemerged, human effort has shiftedtowards using the entire stack to buildsomething new. And it's the same thingwith AI. At least right now, at least inthe next 5 to 10 years. Instead ofstarting everything from scratch, youcan just tell AI what you need and itdoes it for you. Instead of writing eachline of code by hand, you just describewhat you want and AI writes it for you.It's not really cheating. It's atechnology that you now have access tothat a lot of entrepreneurs have hadaccess to for the last 10, 20 years. Ifan entrepreneur wants to buildsomething, he can always hire somebodyand make make the thing happen. Now youalso have the ability to do that. So youare now competing with that entrepreneurwith much lesscost. Now I'm going to tell you aboutthe ultimate rapper. You think theultimate rapper is some SAS page or someproduct that people can buy and then youknow people just make a transaction andthey get it and that's the final rapperthe finished product. I think there's abigger rapper. I think you're missingthe bigger picture. Something that Ionly started seeing 2 or 3 years agoright I had an idea that it would beimportant but in the last 2 3 years Ibecame very convinced about it and it'sworked for us. College fails to teachyou the one skill that matters most atthe highest levels. It's coordination.They glorify the idea of the solo geniuswho builds everything from scratch, butthat is a total myth. I've now met someof the best entrepreneurs and foundersin the world. That's a myth. That's nothow the real world works. The higher yougo, it's less about doing everythingyourself and more about orchestratingpeople, systems, and resources andmaking sure things get done. And that'sthe real game. The more rappers exist,the more pieces there are to coordinate.And the higher you go in the stack, themore valuable coordination becomes.Take my example. What do I do? If youask some communities, they'll say,\"Well, Vun does a lot of stuff invideo.\" If you ask some othercommunities, they'll be like, \"What doesa lot of stuff from Genai?\" If you ask avery different set of communities, theylike, \"He does some stuff in gamedev.\"If you ask a very different set ofcommunity, he's an entrepreneur. He runsa company with x number of people. So,it's just everyone has their own view ofwhat I do. And a lot of people do notbelieve it's possible to do four or fivethings at once. But that's because theysee me on screen every day and they seeone person. They do not realize that AOSas a company is now 300 people and atAOS we're probably doing like 40 or 50projects at once. So we may put out Xproject tomorrow but Y project dayafter. It could be a different teamworking on these projects. Now becauseI'm the platform and the channels wehave are the platform and it may go outas a real on my channel. People think ahVun's doing thing number 55. But thetruth is it's actually a team behind itand this is what every big companyeventually becomes. But the core valueis because I have this audience, I'mable to coordinate how these productsand services go. Take the example ofGoogle and Facebook. It's so funny thatGoogle and Facebook have sort ofrebranded themselves as these reallyhigh-tech research companies when a lotof their revenue actually and a lot oftheir early success came fromadvertising. It actually came from purecoordination. A person wants to sell aflower or has a flower or a boutiquestore for flowers. They want to reachcustomers. They go on Google. they putout adwords. The biggest rapper wherethe most amount of money is made in theecosystem in the economy is incoordination. That's why contentcreators these days are starting to kindof make the kind of wealth that a lot ofentrepreneurs are, right? It seemsstrange and people don't understand why.They're like they're just talking. Yes,they are, but the good ones are alsospending a lot of time coordinating fromtalent to projects to teams to actualproducts to advertising services forpeople who want to advertise things.They are coordinators. The simple truthis you don't make money by knowingthings. You make money by applying whatyou know and fixing problems. But Indiais a vivadriven culture where it's allabout the quiz this thing of hisknowledge knowledge. Can you answer thisquestion and then there's an answer thatdoesn't work right and it's never workedhistorically which is also why I have somuch respect for the sales and marketingpeople. India as a country thinks salesand marketing is like ah salesersonmarketing person it's not real jobs orlook down upon it saying sales peopledon't build anything and think that onlywriting code designing products ormanufacturing something is real workwhile sales and marketing are secondarybut if you think about it sales andmarketing isn't just coordinationbetween products and customers it'sactually the only difference between aproduct that changes the world versus aproduct that gets forgotten people askme why I hype things so much withoutthat it would all die. Not just here,but in almost every company in theworld. If the company stops advertising,marketing, or going out there andgetting in front of people's faces, allthe people who work at the company willprobably lose their jobs. People assumethat if a product is good, it shouldsell itself. But reality is different.You can have the most advanced tech, butif no one understands it, trusts it, orwant it, it simply doesn't matter. TakeIntel for example. It was Marcian TedHoff, an engineer at Intel, thatinvented the architecture for the firstcommercial microprocessor, the Intel4004. But then it was Andy Grove, thecompany CEO at that time, who turned itinto a product that the world couldunderstand, trust, and want. I often saythis, right? If you tomorrow came upwith a cure for cancer, your biggestchallenge is most people wouldn'tbelieve you. You need somebody topackage and advertise it to the rest ofthe world properly first. But ifcoordination and rappers are soimportant, why do many people look downon AI rappers today? Why is there somuch hate, so much push back, so muchjudgment? Why do people not like salesand marketing even though it's like theDNA of the entire economy? If every biginvention is just another layer in thestack, why does everyone have a problemwith AI but not with any other tech?Well, twoproblems. Status and fear is the firstone. See, most people grew up thinkingsoftware engineering was the ultimatecareer path. I remember in 2021, freshgrads were making 20 to 30 lakhs, whichis between $25,000 and $37,000. Ifyou're watching this from outside ofIndia, these were salaries at top techfirms. But now that AI is flooding themarket with clever new automations,these companies are questioning whetherthey even need as many engineers in thefirst place. If you look at the hiringpatterns of some of the larger companiesin India who have generally mass-hiredsoftware engineers their hiring activityhas grinded to a halt. It may not be asmuch about AI it may be a lot more to dowith you know in general the demand forsoftware is saturating like there's alot of software already built for thesame kind of use cases. So people arenot being creative about new use casesbut also it's the fact that the topsoftware engineers have gone wild.They're on steroids. The thought of whyhire 10 developers when one AI poweredsoftware engineer with a tool cangenerate code, debug errors, optimizeperformance, really think through whatshould be built in the first place in afraction of the time. And that's a hardpill to swallow. Many engineers grew upbuilding their entire identities aroundtheir technical skills, whether it bewriting code or being efficient orsolving theoretically complex problems.But now that this technology is here andit's able to solve some of thoseproblems, the world has changed. And Ikeep saying this that the real test ofintelligence is not a specific skillthat you've learned. That actually comesfrom repetition. The more you repeatsomething, the more times you dosomething, the easier it gets to do itthe n plus time plus you're generalizingsome patterns. But the real test ofintelligence is your ability to adapt.If you're feeling threatened, which alot of or see me included, sometimeswhen I use a tool, I feel threatened.I'm like, \"Oh my god.\" But you shouldn'tbe in a place where you don't know whatelse to do. And it is understandablethat the only way to move forward is todefend their identity they grew upbuilding. You can't expect to changethis overnight unless you've trained forit. As an entrepreneur in my career,I've had to pivot many times as themarket changed. See, as an entrepreneur,it's different from being in a job. In ajob, you can do the same thing for 10years, it'll be fine because if thecompany dies, you can move to the nextcompany. If you don't like a specificjob, you can move to the next job. Youcan be in the same field. But as anentrepreneur, if you do something andthen a Facebook or Google do the samething, you really have no choice but topivot, right? So you have adaptabilityhas to be part of your brain. Even whenpeople sometimes shout at you foradapting, you need to do it. It's kindof like now what an entrepreneur hasgone through for maybe 10 20 years oftheir life of being able to navigate themarket as the market itself changes. Noweverybody needs to do that. Turns outmost people are still attached to howthings used to be done. But as I said,the times have changed. Plus, it's notreally new. We've seen this before.We've read countless stories of thepast. In the 1400s, people foughtagainst the printing press. Then in the1800s they fought against factorymachines. Then in the late 1900s theymocked the internet and thought it wouldfail. Even the newspapers were callingthe internet a scam. Now it's AI's turn.People dismiss AI rappers as not realengineering or claim that true skill isin knowing the fundamentals. But if youlook at history, just knowing the basicshas never been enough. It's the ability,like we've mentioned throughout thisvideo, it's the ability to put thingstogether that create value. And that'swhere the second problem comes in. Theeducation system itself. See, it's likewe're just not taught how to articulatewhat we want. One of the biggestproblems with our education system isthat it doesn't teach us how to think insystems and forces us to memorizeconcepts instead. And as a result,people struggle to understandcomplexities and fail to articulateideas clearly. What does articulationmean? We spoke about coordination,right? What's the key skill incoordination? It's being able toarticulate. In Gen Z speak, it isyapping. And it is yapping to get thecomputer to do exactly what you want,not just yapping random things.Articulation is the ability to explainyour thoughts and ideas clearly. So notjust other people can understand it, socan the computer. In this case, theother it's AI. I don't know if you know,but over 27% of Indians, that's over 400million people can't comprehend a singlesentence. When people say, \"Oh, why doyou make things so simple these days?\"Or why do you try to explain overexlainthings in simple fashion? It's becausewe have now realized how wide India isand how few people can finish a sentenceor even finish like a video. Even ifit's a short form video, a lot of peopledon't finish it. They can read thewords, but for some reason they strugglewith deeper understanding. They'rereading the words, but they're not ableto make sense of the sentence. Andthat's the problem. See, when you useAI, you're not just pressing a button.That's not how AI works. You'rearticulating and coordinating differentideas, models, prompts, files, apps,tools, copying from one another, puttingyour own context in there, pastingsomething from somewhere to another,tweaking something here, adjustingsomething there. You don't like theoutput, you want a different output.Sometimes you're manually going in andfixing it. It's not about knowing whateach idea is individually, but knowinghow to use them together to getsomething done. And that's why cleararticulation and coordination are nowthe most important skills.Now, I'll give you a very specificexample of what this means because thisnew skill of being able to prompt,engineer, think, articulate, have somecontext about a specific field. I'm justgoing to show you how it works. Okay?Now, we've got this AI enabled Intel PCright here and we're going to show youhow we are going to be able to do somecool stuff with an LLM. Let's createsomething practical. So, let's say I'm ateacher and I'm going to make aneducational app that visually andintuitively explains how Einstein'sspace-time continuum actually works.Now, you may have heard about thisconcept. It might feel confusing, butlet's show you. So, we're going to usethis tool called cursor to build ourapp. It's an ID and there's an AI there,and I'm going to tell the AI what Iwant. So, we're going to say somethinglike create an interactive 3D website,showing a slightly tilted greenspace-time fabric on a black background.When users click a button, objectsappear and warp the fabric between themand warp the fabric beneath them,simulating gravity-like curvatures withrealtime physics. So now what this isgoing to do is install all the necessarypackages and start the project for us.As you can see, this AI tool justcreated a functional and interactivewebsite to play with. I just click addplanet and it adds a planet for me ontothe fabric which I can move around andsee the space-time distortions in realtime. Not just this, I can now addmultiple planets and see them interacttoo. Now this is where articulationbecomes absolutely critical. When wefirst asked it to create a curvaturebeneath the planet, it got it slightlywrong. The AI placed the curvature basedon the planet's initial drop position,not its current center, which made thedistortion look off. The warping effectdidn't align visually because the centerof the curvature wasn't directly beneaththe center of the planet. But here's thething, it wasn't really AI's fault. Itwas ours. We weren't precise enough inour instruction. Thought we were clear,but we weren't really that articulate.And that difference matters. The momentwe told the AI exactly what we wanted,that the center of the curvature shouldalways track the center of the planet inreal time, it gave us the correct codeinstantly. And this wasn't the only timearticulation proved to be veryimportant. There was another moment.This time, the AI gave me the visualsjust fine, but when I moved an objectwith my cursor, it kept passing throughthe fabric, which obviously shouldn'thappen. Again, not the AI's fault. Itwas mine. I hadn't told it exactly whatI wanted. What I should have said was,lock the X-axis. So the objects stay onthe fabric and don't pass through it.And the moment I said that, it worked.The AI fixed it instantly. And that'sthe real shift here. It's not knowinghow to code every single thing. It'sabout communicating your ideas withclarity and if something goes wrong,being able to drag it in into the wayyou want and fix it. It almost like airbending from Avatar show, right? Likewhere you're bending this air to do whatyou want. You're not really creating airor fire or any of the uh, you know,elements. You're actually moving them inthe direction you want. It's like beinga sailor in a boat where you don'treally control the storm or the water,but you can use this or that you have todirect where it goes. And it's certainlya new skill. I just want to quickly callout the partner of this video. As youjust saw, this Intel AIP PC makes iteasier than ever to build powerfulapplications within hours. All you needis the ability to articulate ideas,orchestrate those ideas, and this IntelPC. And the best part is this PC doesn'teven need an internet connection to useAI models since its hardware is powerfulenough to run LLMs locally. That meansyou can build, create, and learn anytimeand use many different kinds of localmodels. And for parents who want theirchildren to really have a good tool inthe post AI age, this is the perfect wayto give them a head start and make surethey feel confident in their careers.Cuz education today, as you all know,isn't really about learning veryspecific concepts in isolation. It'sabout integration. It's about learninghow all of these ideas connect, how therappers work, how the stack works, howthe layers are, you know, in tandem witheach other, and knowing that knowledgeis just one part of the ecosystem. Whatyou need is application. So, good luckand bye.",
    "summary": "The video argues that \"everything is a wrapper,\" using the example of a coffee shop to illustrate how complex systems are abstracted into simple consumer transactions. Each layer in a \"stack,\" from coffee farmers to the coffee shop itself, relies on the layer below it. The presenter contends that focusing on originality over accessibility and ease of use is a flawed mindset. The value comes not from building from scratch but from abstracting complexity into simple, useful solutions. This mindset has been trained out of us by traditional schools, which encourage memorization instead of deeper understanding and creativity by building on existing tools and ideas.\n\nThe video also explores how capitalism itself is a \"stack of wrappers,\" where interconnected layers work together to create value, from phone technology to Netflix, and how understanding how these layers coordinate is key to success. This coordination, according to the presenter, is more valuable than foundational knowledge, and that understanding how to apply what you know to fix problems is the key to making money. The video critiques education systems that prioritize memorization over system thinking and articulation.\n\nThe presenter argues that AI is just another wrapper in the stack, making complexity easier to use, but it necessitates new skills, particularly articulation and coordination. These skills are increasingly important in the age of AI because they allow individuals to clearly communicate their ideas and coordinate different elements to achieve desired outcomes, thus enabling the ability to direct AI to get the desired output. The presenter concludes with a demonstration of using AI to build an app, showcasing how clear articulation and problem-solving are crucial in leveraging AI effectively."

    "transcript": "Hi everyone, this is GKCS.In today's video\nwe go through Google Borg.This is a paper from 2015.But Google Borg has been there\nfor two decades at Google since 2005.And the reason why it's lasted so long\nis because it is an absoluteall system of Google.It provides compute and memoryfor processes.98% of all the serversat Google are running because of Borg.So Borg managesthe entire lifecycle of a process\nfrom start to finish.If you're an application developer,\nall you have to worry about is your code.And once you're ready, you just deploywhat goes and finds a different data\nscientist to deploy this tool.It finds the right number of resources\nthat have to be allocated.It makes sure that in case it\ncrashes, it's restarted.And in case it's just failing a lot,\nthen it has to be migrated.Everything end to end is managed by Borg.It's so good\nand so popular that, open source project.You might have heard of this.Kubernetes\nis developed by the engineers at Googlewho built Borg,\nand this is extremely similar to work.I would say 90% of the internal\narchitecture is understandableif you go to this paper.So by the end of this video,\nI hope that, you know,Kubernetes is also easy to understand.And as with Kubernetes, Borg\nhas similar requirements.It does load balancing.Make sure that.So this is deployed across the hardwarethat you have judiciously\nutilized the money that you've spentthe other thing\nit does is process lifecycle management.Part of this is service discoverymeaning you have to identify\nwhere the process exists.Borg has a list of this.If you deploy your application,\nlet's say Google Maps,and you deploy this in two clusters\nand you have 50 total serverswhich are running,\nthis Borg is going to note downwhere they are running in case one of them\ncrashes, then it's going to restart it.But also if you're\nthe application developerand want to know where exactly they are\nrunning, you can see the entire list.So Borg has something called Borg naming.So DNS, DNS, they have everything.It also manages autoscaling.And this day and age 2025 it.This seems simple, but in 2005\nthis is a big deal.And Google used to manage\nGoogle scale autoscaling at that time.And the final thing is capacityplanning.This to me seems like a more machine\nor hardware problem.But what can help you do that?By giving you the proper metrics\nand observabilityfor a DevOps engineer, you can look at\nthe amount of services which, applicationneeds, and based on that,\nyou can go and buy a fleet of servers.If you need to.You can basically make good business\ndecisions based on this.So these are the features of Borg.What's the scale like?He's pretty big.4 billion containersare deployedevery week at Google.4 billion containers.These are like 4 billion processes.As you can expect,\nit is highly configurablebecause you have all the engineers\nat Google,pretty much everybody at Google using what\nthey have their own requirements.If you give them an extensible,\nconfigurable system,then they are going to use it.Otherwise\nthey will find their own solutions.So you don't want that to happen.You want the system to be easily usable,\nbut at the same time extensible.And finally it is highly available.The way to think of\nthis is everything runs on Borg, soGFS runs on board spanner.You're right, it runs on Borgeverything including Bigtablewhich basically manages\nGoogle search runs on this application.If Borg fails then Google is down.So that can't happen.That has to happen extremely rarely,\nand you will see the kind of thingsthat what does to make sure\nthat this doesn't happen.Okay.Before we start\nwith the internals of Borg,I'll just tell you the differences\nbetween Borg and Kubernetes.Maybe you can skip this part\nif you are not interested in Kubernetes,but because this is\na very popular project,I'll just mention the high level\ndifferences.The first thing is Kubernetes is open\nsource, Borg isn't.Borg is set to be deployed\nin very large cells or clusters.Kubernetes can be deployed\nat almost any scale.The main benefit of Kubernetes\nis not just that it's open source.It's also easier to learn.It has better documentation,\nand it has better APIs.That is, APIs are designed\nwith generic terms.Borg has very Google specific\nor Borg terms.The other thing is that Kubernetes\nhas decentralized orchestration.So Borg has a central server, Borg master,\nwhich tellsyou will do this\ntask, you will do this task.But Kubernetes has a set of microservices\nwhich manage different partsof the cluster.And so it is you can say better,\nmore modern, but Borg also works.So it's just a more of a design choice.One interesting point that I noticed about\nKubernetes is you can actually tagthe odds that you have in Kubernetes.Those are called Borg.Let's your odds and Borg lids.They're the same concept.But in Kubernetes you can say that\nthese pods are part of Google Maps.But here you can't okay.You have to go and actually query\nfor with a particular edge.Also you can say that this is production\nor you can say that this is in India.All of those tags can be given\nin Kubernetes.But Borg doesn't\nhave such a rich language.Querying and debugging and observability\nis slightly improved here.For all I know, it's 2025.Borg has probably taken all of these open\nsource ideas and already moved it here.They are not going to mention\nthat in the paper.What do you see?\nThat is a small difference.Okay, let's get\ninto the internals of Borg.Every job has a state which is defined bythe priority of the task.So this might be production levelor batch level or just free.Three is basically or things\nwhich don't really matteras much as a MapReduce job in prod\nor real time application in prod.And even before this,\nthere is actually monitoring.So monitoring is most importantbecause if things fail\nthen these jobs have to exist.So that's at the highest priority level.What happens is if you have a job\nwhich is running,let's say at priority batch\nand you have an incoming jobof production, then\nthis job is going to be preempted, it'sgoing to be killed, and this machine\nis actually going to pick up this new job.Okay. This is a simple algorithm.Low priority jobs are kicked out.Sometimes this can become really bad.Let's say\nyou have a monitoring job come inand you have a production job over here.Then this job is going to get killed and\nmove to some other place, which is batch.And then this job is going to get killed\nand moveto some other place which is running free,\nresulting in a lot of jobs being killed.And so to avoid this production, jobs\ncannot be preempted.Okay.You can only kick out existing batch\nor free jobs.Now, this is just a way\nto avoid the cascade.There's other things\nalso that a bug job can contain.One of them is rules or constraints.So you may specify the typeof operating system that you need\nand basically generic rules.You can talk about\nthe IP addresses and so on.Now thiscan look like a linear programing problem\nright.That you want the region to be India\nbut you want ten large servers and so on.And then border has to figure out\nhow to allocate these thingsin the most efficient way possible.Yes, it can be.So the engineers can provide constraints,\nbut most engineers don't.They don't really need\nthese kind of constraints.Most use cases are that,\nyou know, just run this jobsomewhere and things are fine.But the constraints are a possibility.Now when we say running a job,\nwhere is this?What is this exactly?Is it a virtual machine?Well, it can be,\nbut most jobs are not running on a VM.This VM is too slow,\nlike a windows VM is a bit slow.So instead what you can do is usea Linux container.The security is managed by C root gene.If you know about these things\nthen congratulations.You know quite a bit about Linux.And resources are managed by C Group.These are Linux specific terms.This is basically a wayto make sure that some resources\nare allocated to a particular container.And this is to make sure\nthat nobody else gets access to this.In fact, you might have doneC mod in your life\nsometime and changing file permissions.Think of it like that.And here C group\nyou can think of how much networkhow much file storage\ndo I give this container.So in this way you make sure thatan engineer who's a application\nengineer can run their application.Knowing that I need at least\nthis much file storage just for logs.Let's say once they have defined\nthat here, you can execute thison a VM or in this container,\nif you have to restart the process,send a signalterm signal here which is basically till-15 means please die.And if you do not die\nthen there are other wayswhich is signal.That's a n minus nine.Okay. Again\nthings that you might have used in Linux.It forces the container to shut down\nand then it can berestarted.Gog has the concept of a cell\nwhich is about10,000 machines at Google scale.This 10,000 machines\nsounds like a small cell, butthis is a pretty big number.So single cell has one master.Okay, it's a single point of failure,\nbut we will see why availabilityis not affected much,\neven if it goes down.The basic idea is\nif a block master goes down,then the bottlenecks continuefunctioning and a block master\nsets up the configurationof the power plates, which are basically\nlike pods in Kubernetes.It tries to assign these tasks\nwhich come to it okay, these are commandswhich are sent that please\nexecute this application on 5000 machines.Once a cell is chosen, one master\nthen tries to spread this applicationfor high fault tolerance.So you have different power\ndomains, you have different regions.And this is actually a bean\npacking problem.The basic idea is\nif you have an application running hereup one and you have another application\nrunning here up to,and the third application\nis coming in one of these two,then which one do you choose?So you choose no one.Which has a perfect fit with app three.So then what happens is\nthis is running at 100% capacity.Best fit maximum usage.Or do you try to find any one\nwhich can take care of app three?So let us say there's 60% compute\nremaining here.And here you only had\n30% remaining app three required 30%.You gave 30%.It's the best fit,\nbut you could have put it here as well.It didn't matter.So this would have been faster, lower\nassignment, but it would be a bad fit.So at scale,\nmaybe the compute power would be wastedif the next process has 40%\ncompute power requiredand you put 30% in here,\nthen you have only 30% remaining.And with both of these, with 30,\nthis new app can't fit anywhere.This looks like a really bad idea,\nbut the idea with Borg isthey want to quickly\nassign tasks to the Borg.Let's.And the second thing\nis, best fit has a risk.In case this app takes more than 30%,\nit claims that I can do it 30%,but if it takes 35%, as is common\nwith MapReducejobs, you kind of underplay\nthe requirements you need.Then this app is going to crash.So resilience is a problem here. Borg.What it tries to do is\nit takes a hybrid of these two approaches,and it tries to fit the application\nin a place which has some space remaining.So let's say 40% or 50%,\nbut it also tries to fit them snugly.So that's the approach\nhybrid fit algorithm.Now once an application is assigned\nto a model it once it is running herethere is a mapping\nadded in a service called BNS.It stands for Borg Naming Service.Okay.Very similar to a domain name server.This keeps a serverto IP mapping.So in this case\nyou're going to have something likelet's say\nthis is the 30th server of app one.So that's going to be 30 dot app one dot.The user who has executed\nthis command on board masterthe cell id.borg.google.com.I don't know why they have this part,\nthey can just sounds cool or something,but in this way you can, you know,\nhave some sort of a regexwhich says not on google.com\nas at the end for this cell ID.So you're doing an inverse,\nthe reverse rejects this cell ID,this user who has started\nthe task for this applicationget me all the servers\nand then we can store these in a file.With their states.So this application is currently pending\nmeaning it has to be picked up.It has to be assigned to some late.This one is runningand this one is stopped okay.So different states\nand also the health of the model.It can be noted down over here.All the metadata around\nexecution is stored in chubby.Chubby in case you don't know is a Paxosbased persistent store.This is used by Google.It is a key value store.The problem with chubby\nnow is that they have Google Spanner,which is a highly consistent,highly available system\nwhich is a distributed lock service.So it is highly consistent\nif you have all of your rights on chubby.But I'm not sure blog\nmaster has actually moved to spanner.Now, another interesting point\nis these Borg nets when they are runningthe applications,\nstore the logs of these filesin a local file.I was expecting that\nthese will go to Google file system, butno, these are just local files\nand they are rotated.So every day or every hourthe frequency is not mentioned\nbut the files are actually deleted.So after the botnet has finished\nprocessing this appor moved it from one place to another,\nthese logs will be deleted.So within 1 or 2 days\nafter the movement logs are purged.It's interesting\nto note that metrics from this applicationare also emitted earlier.There used to be something called Borgman.Now there is something called monad.You can check out the video\nexplaining this time series data store.The basic idea here is it\nhelps in observabilityof the system, and if you're looking\nfor business decisions,then these app metrics\nare again sent to Dremel.So here you can findSQL queries\nto see how much capacity do you need.Or you know what kind of applications\nare taking up most of the compute powerbased on this\nwe can make business decisions.The funny thing is, if a machine\nis running out of some sort of resource,let's say you're running out of memory,\nthen you can't avoid it.Like you can't get more memory\nin the same machine.So Borg startskilling processes, and the first ones\nit kills are the ones with low priority.So batch jobs or free jobs,\nthose are taken care of in case it'sa temporary issue, like CPU usage is 100%\nor I was completely choked out.In that case, Borg\nactually waits for a while.But again, if things don't improve,\nthen processes start to die,starting with low as too high a priority.Now you might be wondering what happens\nif Borg Master dies.Yes, Borg, let's continue functioning.But one issue is if it dies, then\nno new task can come in.So it's important not to let it die.And you have basically replicas\nof what master.So these are in-memory replicas\nand the five of thesethey have read using Paxos.What happens is since they are in sync,\nin case one board master dies,then another is selected and then it takes\ncare of the provisioning.Here with the bottlenecks,\nthis is mostly taken care of againby chubby, which stores\nall the state of the Borg master.Finally, there are some optimizations\nthat Borg has for scaling up.One of them is caching.Very heavy use of caching.The idea is a Borg.It has some parameters. It's in a region.It is of a particular size,the server has a particular size\nand maybe it has a power outlet.It's connected to this.So all of these things are common.You do not have to recompute it\nagain and againunless you are changing the configuration\nor the physical server.You do not have to change the score\nor the definition of this bond. Let.So all of this config informationis cached in mod master.So when it's making a decision\nwhere should I send this application to.It has all of this config cached.It has this scoresof each model it cached.And so it can quickly make a decision\nas to where to send this application to.Similarly,\napplications are not very different.You know you have Google Maps,\nwhich is a kind of an application.You will have email,\nwhich is a kind of an application.Many of these are going to be similar.So instead of having each application\nspecific requirements,you have a class of applications.So one might be IO intensive.Another might be memory intensive.Another might be CPU intensive.So now based on\nthe class of the app are runningyou can find the appropriate block\nlike this again is something that you canconstrain in the number of variations\nand also cache.And lastly, when an application\nis going to be assignedmore tries to find bottleneckswhich already have the libraries required\nfor that application.This is similar to Bazel\nwhich caches the libraries.So instead of you\ncaching the libraries in every bottle, itof course you find the best fit\nbased on alreadyinstalled libraries, and this reduces the\nstart time from 25 secondsto just five seconds.So deploying an application\nacross thousands of serversbecomes a very fast process.So that's it for Google Blog.It's a very interesting and simple system.Most of Google runs on it. 98% of Google\nruns on it.What I find interesting about it\nis it's got this concept of cells.It's got this concept of both master\nand portlet.That's almost all of the containerization\nlogic that you have.Everything else is external.And this was made in 2005.So conceptslike autoscaling and cross-region fault\ntolerance were not very common back then.But Google solved this problem.The principal engineers went aheadand actually made this system,\nwhich has lasted for two decades now.So thank you for watching this video.If you have any doubts or suggestions,\ndo let me know in the comments.If you liked the video\nthen do hit the like button.And if you want notifications\nfor further videoslike this, hit the subscribe button.\nI'll see you next time. Bye bye!",
    "summary": "This video provides an overview of Google Borg, the internal cluster management system that has been running the majority of Google's services since 2005. Borg manages the entire lifecycle of processes, from deployment and resource allocation to restarting and migrating applications upon failure. It offers load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, and capacity planning. Borg is highly configurable and available, handling billions of containers every week. Kubernetes, a popular open-source project, was heavily inspired by Borg, sharing a similar architecture. Borg prioritizes tasks and preempts lower-priority jobs (batch or free) to accommodate higher-priority ones, like production services, and avoids cascading preemption.\n\nThe video also contrasts Borg with Kubernetes. Borg is a Google-internal system, whereas Kubernetes is open source and has decentralized orchestration. The internal workings of Borg involves Cells (clusters) containing Borg masters and Borglets. Borg masters manage the configuration of Borglets, which are similar to Kubernetes' pods. Resource allocation involves a hybrid \"best fit\" algorithm. The Borg Naming Service (BNS) maps servers to IPs, and metadata is stored in Chubby (a Paxos-based persistent store). Borg also optimizes performance through caching of configurations, application classes (IO, memory, CPU intensive), and pre-installed libraries on Borglets.\n\nFinally, it emphasizes the innovative nature of Borg, which introduced concepts like autoscaling and cross-region fault tolerance long before they became widely adopted. Despite its age, Borg continues to be a fundamental part of Google's infrastructure. Even though Borg itself logs to local files that get rotated, important metrics are sent to Dremel for queryability and help with important business decisions."

    "transcript": "so today I want to talk about how tostart your writing Journey as a softwareengineer now why I'm talking about thisbecause I write a lot and I have seenprofound impact on myself because I havebeen consistently writing for four yearsin the last four years 2020 21 22 23 Ihave written 165 articles published itthrough my newsletter and wrotethousands of social media post I writeat least one article a week on anaverage and two post on social platformsone in the morning one in the evening onLinkedIn and Twitter all of them D Techno fluff either on engineering or onCareer growth or in technicalobservation or a news it is alwaysrelevant for engineers right so what canyou write about right or what did Iwrite about so I write about things thatamuses me right so because of the innatecuriosity that I have now been able tobuildthings that amuses me I go deeper intoit try to understand and once I have abasic understanding I write about it andwhich solidifies my understanding rightso I write about career growth paperdissections Advanced algorithms andwhatnot let me walk you through mysubstack that would give you an idea onyou know the things I write about sothis is what my substack homepage lookslike on which you can say I write aboutcareer growth I write about systemdesign I write about deep Dives dissectpapers have written a bunch of thingsabout uh outest dissection now obviouslywhen I started writing it was okay okayit was not fabulous right but over timeI improved a lot right then I gotstructured into my writing the way allof my articles are uh all of like Iwrite my articles there is a structureto it right and I try to make itattractive I adding a gif over here itlooks pretty cool if you go through mysubstract you would see right and thenI've categorized it over here no fancytool just one substract newsletter andit's pretty much sorted right so you cancategorize it on substract if you likeright apart from this I also publish itbecause basically substack for me it'sabout uh uh distribution it is not aboutthe place where I own my articles so Ihave my personal website on which all ofthese articles go everything that I everwrote about anywhere it goes over hereyou can see topics like C pyth andinternals articles I wrote about it onprogramming understanding HTTP protocolsthe math behind tfidf then Advancedalgorithms you would see career growthyou would see fireal failure detectionalgorithm there are some fascinatingstuff some implementation of consistenthashing right things that amuses meright instead of getting stuck with uhlike hey this is what I need for my workthis is what I would do I have gone onmassive breath to understand how thingswork right as simple as thatso pick anything that excites you rightand then over time don't think that yourfirst article would be next levelmind-blowingly awesome and you would getthousands of likes and all over time youwould build it right now things Ilearned or things you would learn uhTechnically when you write consistentlyon social platforms first of all ithelped me become a better engineer nodoubt about it two factors thatcontributed to it the most first is Iexplored a lot of Concepts and domainsbecause of this so I gained a massivebreath right because I was alwaysresearching about my next article rightand second is I loved writing abouttough topics for example Advancedalgorithms like f Martin like like firefailure dediction fractional cascadingdatabase internals like these I neverthought that hey I want to know thisthat's why it's more about I wasstumbling upon something I was surfingsomething got something interestinglet's Deep dive into it right thatinnate curiosity when you build it justgoes a very long way right and non-technically I built three abilitiesfirst ability is that I am able to nowarticulate my thoughts better conveywhat I want to convey in a very nice waybe it emails be it communication be itannouncement stuff everywhere plus ithas helped me build an ability to thinkfaster and deeper because now that I'vetouched lot of Concepts touched upontough topics articulate my thoughtswrote about it it gave me an ability tothink better and faster right and thirdis now when I write things on socialplatform it does not take a long timefor me to write because I have beenwriting for four years right so itbecomes writing is easy plus I can makeit engaging right these are things thatI gained um non-technically out ofwriting consistently now why should youwrite because of all of these things buton top of that I believe is when wewrite with think right so basically whenyou're writing something about any topicyou would realize the gaps in yourunderstanding that's when you would goback understand it and then rearticulateyour thoughts that's really importantbecause it is a way for you to do self-introspection and make your Conceptsvery clear it helps you buildarticulation is always there and as avery interesting byproduct you can builda personal brand that hey I like talkingabout this stuff I write about thisstuff when people people visit yourprofile or your substack they would seethe same thing that hey this personwrites about desktop so this person hasa detailed understanding of this topicand that's important it's a win rightit's a byproduct right don't drive forthat but let it be a by product andenjoy the journey ofwriting now how should you start as anengineer it's very important that youstart with a goal don't just go all overthe place understand why you want towrite is it is it because you want tobuild a brand is it because you want tobuild a deeper understanding or is itbecause you just want to get clarity inyour thoughts and fill the gaps in yourunderstanding right that's Define thatright so that you write you pick thetopics of the Articles to go in thatdirection right second is you identifythe domain don't go all over the placedon't start writing about financespersonal finance and then career growthalso and then leadership also andtechnical side also and database alsoright pick apick 52 articles on that and startwriting about each one of them skip itreally simple so that you build a depthin a certain thing and your readerswon't get confused your readers shouldknow what to expect or they should knowwhat to expect out of your newsletter orout of your um articles that you writeright and more importantly when youstart decide the 52 topics for that yearbecause I've seen this whenever you havea well defined steps it becomes veryeasy to be on track the first thing thatI did when I took my New Year resolutionI did not take it on 1st of Jan right Itook it in the last week of December andfor two days me and my me and mycolleague sat together and decided these52 topics is what I would be writingabout I only used four of them or fouror five of them because I was alwaysstumbling upon something new right butbecause I had that cushion that Ialready knew the 52 topics that I canwrite about even if I have a slumpperiod I do not have to put a lot ofthought into hey what do I need to writeabout I have the topic and I can startwriting about it right so pick a list of52 articles that you would want to writeabout beforehand before you starteverything and but how do you get thosetopics imagine things that you learnedin the past try to recall them thatcould be the topic that you write aboutlist a topics that you always wanted toknow pick a domain pick a book and startwriting about the stuff or go throughexisting articles from existingdevelopers and take them as aninspiration and dive and start divingdeep into those topics right so pickwhatever works for you but moreimportantly have those 52 article titlesready right so that it helps you be ontrack the next one it's which tools touse I keep it dead simple I use obsidianto write it's my knowledge base right Iwrite everything everything that I writeeverything that I think goes in obsidiansecond I put everything on my personalwebsite because that is a real estate oninternet this is my real estate oninternet and third for distribution Iuse substract newsletters and Linkedinnewsletters right so that it goesdirectly in the inbox so that verylikely people to be reading it right andone caution do not plagi your X this issomething that is a big red flag becauseyou know what happens is you may takeinspiration from articles but in theprocess you might be bluntly copyingthem if original author finds it outthat person can just make a post onsocial platform it would just ruin allthe credibility that you build over thetime so it is not worth it to prize soif you take anything from any articlecite it be it in article YouTube videoanywhere and second and most importantlybecause it's jpt and Bish era stop copypasting do not copy paste from chat gbtand stuff because people know people caninfer your readers will in that this ischat GPT copy paste right be yourselfright on your own because at end beselfish it is you who are writing it youwould be getting benefit it's not thatyou not doing it for readers do it foryourself do it for your understandingyour deep Concepts the clarity that youwould get out of it right alwaysremember don't just bluntly copy pasteit does not mean to G followers justbecause because people are smart theyare not stupid and if you getfollowership because of that thenprobably those are not the people whoyou want to follow you simple as thatright okay and the next part all thevery best for your writing Journey it'samazing it has been four years of mewriting on social platforms and articlesand whatnot it has been truly truly lifechanging it has been a game changer forme to be honest I much more deeper I'mmuch more like I think a lot now I writevery quickly it has changed it haschanged the game for me right and if youlike this thank you so much much forwatching and I keep writing deep textstuff across my socials uh if youresonate do give me a follow TwitterGitHub find find this link if you likewhat I or if you find what I writeinteresting give me a follow onsubstract and that's where I go verydeep into things that I write I haverecently started a series on Careergrowth you might find it amusing rightso yeah these all what I wanted to talkabout all the very best with yourwriting Journey that's it for this oneI'll see you in the next one thanks[Music]time[Music]the",

    "title": "Are junior devs screwed?",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76K2r2UFeM4",
    "addedAt": "06/04/2025",
    "transcript": "I have to admit something to y'all. WhenI got my first job as a software dev, Iwas not qualified in the slightest. Ireally probably shouldn't have evengotten the job if I'm being totallyhonest. The reason I got it was themanager and the other people on the teamliked me and vied with me. Inparticular, the manager liked my musictaste, funny enough. And I had a fewprojects that showed I kind of maybecould figure out code, but they didn'teven give me a full-time offer. Theygave me a three-month contract that Idid okay during. And rather than give afull-time after that, I renewed thethree-month contract again to try andfinally prove that I knew what I wasdoing. And it was a grind. That sixmonths is within the hardest I've everworked. I learned a ton. I grew a bunch.And finally, by the end of it, I wouldsay I was somewhat qualified as anengineer. So, why am I talking about allof this? Well, the world has changedquite a bit. the things that made itpossible for me to have that job and thevalue that I provided to that companyare all in a weird spot now, especiallyin the era of AI. This video is unlikemy others where I'm actually trying totalk to juniors for once. Normally, mycontent is not that. But if you're not ajunior dev, it's still worth watchingthis because we need to sympathize withand offer paths to success for thesejunior devs who are getting into theindustry right now because it has neverbeen weirder and arguably harder to getyour first gig as a dev and the bar isin a really, really weird spot. We got alot to dive into here, but I'm notmaking an end salary anymore, so we haveto find some other way to pay the team.So, quick word from today's sponsor,then we'll get straight to it. Softwaredev has never been more accessible, butactually learning to do things right iskind of challenging. Now that there isso much slop all over the internet, younever know if you're hearing fromsomeone that actually knows what they'redoing. Unless you use today's sponsor,Brund Masters. These guys get it. And Iknow that not just because they'recalled front-end masters. It's because abunch of the people who make their 200plus courses are personal friends andex-coorkers of mine. These courses aremade by experienced engineers from allover the industry. From front end toback end, from Expo to Stripe, fromNetflix to Twitch, there are so manypeople here that you guys will probablyknow. I say that because a lot of themare my friends and even my heroes andalso Melky. But seriously though, John'sin here all over the place. I reallypersonally want to go watch themastering Chrome DevTools one cuz thisis I don't feel like I'm using theChrome DevTools anywhere near wellenough and I've been doing this for waytoo long. We got Prime in here, KevinPowell, the CSS god, Katie from Expo,one of the most talented React Nativeengineers I've ever had the pleasure oftalking to. It's insane. They couldcharge a lot of money for any one ofthese courses. The fact that they allcome together as one subscription withclear paths on how to learn all thesedifferent things is insane. And don'tthink this is just for people who arelearning how to code. If you alreadyhave a job in the industry, there's agood chance you can get your company touse education budget to cover yoursubscription to get to see all of thisuseful, awesome content. And that'sknowledge that will benefit you at yourjob and future jobs, too. Get 25% offtoday atsoyv.link/masters. So when I was gettinginto software dev, the industry was inan interesting spot. The amount of devsit took to solve a problem wasrelatively high. The amount of devsavailable was relatively low. So if wehave these multiple functions, let's saywe have the first axis here is number ofdevs per feature. So how many devs andhow much time does it take to buildsomething? Second, we have number ofdevs available or higher. And three, wehave money available to hire them. Thesethree axes have been going all over theplace lately. For a long time, thesetrended in ways that benefited us asdevs. I would argue now, for the firsttime, they're not. The number of devsneeded per feature has slowly went down.There are moments where it goes downfaster, but for the most part, it's beenslowly going down. The number of devsavailable to hire has been much morequickly going up and the amount of moneyavailable to hire thesepeople. I hope I'm making my point here.It's utterchaos. This is the way we need to thinkwhen we are considering what does itmean to get a job right now. If we justignore the money aspect entirely for aminute, just think about these two. If Iwas building a Gmail killer back in theday, the number of engineers that wouldtake was really high. The amount ofengineers available to do it was reallylow. And the engineers needed to dosomething like that had to be prettydeep and pretty technically advanced. Soduring this era, early on enough, if youjust look at the gap between theselines, it all start to make sense. Ifthe number of engines available is lowand the number you need per feature ishigh, this gap, there's a term for this.The term for this gap isleverage. We as the employees, as theengineers doing the building, making thethings, actually providing the toolsthat created the value for the company,we had a lot of leverage because theycouldn't just replace us. There were notenough devs to do it. There were evencrazy practices going on that are meme'don nowadays, but were very real at thetime where companies would compete byhiring engineers other companies needed.Facebook hired the creators of almostevery web framework, not because theywanted them to build a better framework.In fact, most of the React team wasn'tthose framework people. They hired themso Google couldn't have them. There wascompetition at these weird deep levelswhere they would hire engineers just tomake it harder for the competition toget them themselves. That is not thecase at all anymore. But that was onlythe case because of how insane the ratiohere was. The number of availableengineers versus the number of engineersneeded. That gap was insane. Over time,that gap has gotten smaller. In fact, Iwould make the argument it is flippedthe other way where given anything acompany needs to build, if they're a bigenough company that they can afford tohire you, chances are that companyalready has a bunch of engineers thatare optimized that they can move over togo do that thing. It is more likely thata company at this point is going toreorg their existing staff than botherhiring new people because the likelihoodthat they hired too many people back inthe day because they needed them so badand now half of them are working onfeatures nobody uses or they're justsitting around doing nothing then getreorged and if they can't they can getlaid off instead. That has fully removedour leverage where previously we couldkind of just do whatever we wanted onthis side because the companies neededus so badly it didn't really matter.that has flipped fully where we kind ofhave to do what the companies want evenif you have experience in the industry.So let's do a much more like practicalreal world example here. Let's say I'mworking on just use example earlier. I'mbuilding Twitch chat. We have to add anew feature to Twitch chat and we wantto do it in a year. I spec it out andit's going to take four engineers theyear to get this done in time. So, Ihave these four spots. I already haveperson one and two ready to go, but Ineed to hire two more people. Back inthe day, I would have opened theselistings up on our job board. Would havegotten some number of applications, andmost of the applications are going to bepeople fresh out of college, still incollege, earlier career people. Maybe weget a couple more senior people, butit's unlikely. Even for a senior role,the number of inbound applications ofexperienced people was relatively low.So to tier these, I'd say like the whitecolor is already on team. We'll sayyellow is poached from other team. AndI'll say green is hired in. I'll alsoextend this a bit and say we actuallyneeded five people, not four. Thinknumbers a little more real. Person threevery likely could have been poached fromanother team or pulled in from a reorgor something, but then we're hiring twonew people. What's funny is this exampleI have here is exactly how we did ModView, which is a product I helped runover at Twitch. We realized that ModView wasn't a thing we could just buildwith our current staff. So, we grabbedone person from a different team thatwanted to be more on the safety side andthen I hired in more people to fill outthe gaps. And the result was a team thatwas partially people who already workedon the team or in that area at thecompany, a person who moved over andthen two additional people that we hiredin. This was back in 2020 2021 era. Sonot as absurd as it used to be, butstill very real. And these roles werecompetitive. These got hundreds ofapplications. I did a ton of interviewsto get the right people for these roles.One of them was an intern that we hadwho killed it. So we brought herfull-time as quickly as we could.Unreal. Waterl devs are cracked. And shewas even amongst Waterl devs. One of thebest I've ever worked with. And theother we poached from another company. Ibelieve it was Disney Plus. So eventhen, like one of these had to gothrough the internship and impress us toget the spot. The other one had to comefrom another qualified company. And eventhen, we actually massively underpaidand underleveled this person. And Ipersonally had to fight a lot of peoplebecause we brought them in at the wronglevel. And I I needed them to get apromotion. I delayed my own promotion tomake sure person five here would gethers in time. Wild experience. But pointI'm making here is this was a realisticthing back in the day. If I was buildingthis today, first and foremost, thenumber of people has gone down a lot.This is for a bunch of reasons. Thecombination of decreasing theexpectations for the product, trying toget it out faster and get feedbackearlier, plus the tools that we buildthe website with being better, plus theAI making it way quicker to build. Thosetwo roles are just gone now. They don'texist. That's a huge change. thelikelihood that the things we'rebuilding internally, just from myliteral personal direct experience, justa 3 to five year difference now, thoseroles don't exist. Hell, if we downsizeenough, we might be able to do this withjust two people. Now, this person whowas on a failing team that we poached,they might just get laid off.So given these people, even pretendingthese were junior engineers, which theywere not, these were experienced people,where do they go? How do these peopleget in when the box they're trying toget into has gotten smaller and thespace that the teams have and the timethey have is harder to justify doingthat? Because realistically speaking,the way I kind of think of this is we dohave a third person, so to speak, onthis team, but it's not person three.this person 3.5 Claude and if this is myteam comp where do I put the juniorengineer it doesn't they don't fit andit sucks it genuinely sucks that thereisn't a good spot for these people tocome in the way that there would havebeen in the past it's a weird painfulreality and I'm not saying to give upI'm not saying you can't get a job I'mnot saying this is all a worthlessjourney I'm saying we have to think abit differently about it and this isn'tthe only place that we have to Thinkabout it. This is just the hiring side,but I want to go to a different layer. Iwant to talk about getting good as ajunior. When I was learning to program,we didn't have AI. We had StackOverflow. It was not always the mostaccurate thing. So, when I ran into ahard problem, I had a crazy process totry and solve it. I would hack at it tomy best ability, isolate the problem,Google search the isolated parts to seeif I could find anything. And afterdoing it for a while and giving up, Iwould very shyly go up to my manager,who was an incredible dev, and ask him,\"Hey, can you help me with this? I haveno idea what's going on.\" And they wouldhold my hand through it and often justforce me to rethink the whole problem. Iwas like, like if I was trying to figureout why this element was rendering withthe wrong data, he could come in andsay, \"Why are you rendering that elementat all? That doesn't need to exist.\" andbe like, \"Oh, yeah. I was so deep in theweeds, I never came up.\" And if we thinkof problems as having layers, the layeryou're thinking about it in and solvingit in can vary a lot. And the mostcommon problem I see juniors runninginto is they're in here when the problemexists way higher up, like it should behere, but they can't stop thinking aboutthe error message in their console forlong enough to take the step back andrealize the problem exists somewhereelse. The key is that I had to. Therewas no option. I couldn't just hack atthis until it went away. I might be ableto sometimes, but I certainly couldn'tmost of the time. The majority of thetime, if I was getting a weird uncaughexception in my browser, and I couldn'tfigure out the line of code causing itor whatever, I would have to step up inthe like hierarchy of where the problemlives to figure out what layer I canchange to fix the problem happening wayfurther down.That's not how it works anymore. Claude,fix thiserror. This is why I'm scared. Humansdon't like hard things. They can tellthemselves they do. They can act asthough they do, but it is human instinctto steer away from things that are hardor painful or bad. It's a basicevolutionary mechanism. If somethinghurts, you don't do it. If somethingfeels stupid, you don't do it. If thisberry smells weird, you don't eat it.It's basic human evolution. So, ifsolving this uncut exception requiresthe hard, painful process of taking eachstep up and most importantly each stepalong the way feeling slightly dumber.You'll take the easy out. The key tobecoming a great engineer is first andforemost to accept and embrace the factthat you're not a great engineer. Ifyou're not willing to feel stupidconstantly and live in that feeling,bask in it as you challenge yourself tosolve problems and to leave the layeryou're in, to figure out what's wrong,to ask yourself, did I just do thiswhole thing wrong? And be down to humbleyourself in that way and challenge yournotions, challenge your understanding ofthings constantly. Gabriel beat me toit. Feeling dumb becomes the bestfeeling once you learn to embrace it. Iam so lucky that I learned this in avery different place. I've done a couplevideos where I talk about this, butnobody ever cares. So, I'm going toforce y'all, trick y'all into hearing ithere. There's a certain thing I got intoat a young age that has helped me a lot.I'm going to give one more hint to seeif you guys could figure out what it isthat I'm talking about here. Very, veryaccurate diagram of myskateboard. I love skateboarding. Notjust the cruising around like thestreets. I love the challenge of doingthings you've never done before,possibly things that no one's ever donebefore with this piece of wood withwheels attached. To get good atskateboarding, you don't sit and read abook about it all day. You don't go toclass and get told how skateboards work.To get good atskateboards, you have to gethurt. The only way you improve in theworld of skateboarding is hitting theground. You have to go in expecting tohit the ground. You have to prepareyourself and arguably teach yourself toroll so when you hit the ground itdoesn't hurt as bad. You be preparedevery time you go up with theexpectation that you don't come down theway you want because then what happensis a magical thing. You ride away. Andthat feeling when you jump up expectingto get hurt and you land correctly, thatis so magical. And you have to engineeryourself to be prepared for that toexpect the fall so greatly to anticipatethis knowing that this is the thingyou're actually doing and then surpriseyourself when this happens instead. Sowhen you try to build something as anearlier career engineer, you shouldn'twrite the code expecting to run it andhave it work. Because if you go in withthat expectation and it doesn't work,now you feel bad. Now you feel like afailure. Now you feel unqualified. Nowyou feel like Claude's the easy out. Nowyou feel like ChatGpt will solve theproblem. Now you're paying for a cursorsubscription before you even gotten paidas a developer. That sucks. And I on onehand rely heavily on these tools. Mostof the stuff I've been building recentlyI could not have built anywhere near aseffectively without cursor. It's rewiredmy brain. But it's rewired my brain thatwas already wired to solve hard problemsthis way to go in with the expectationthe thing doesn't work. So I would beforced to reduce the number of things.So if any one thing doesn't work, it'seasier to identify, fix, and replace.But also to prepare myself emotionallyfor this journey and this experience.All of that sucks, but once you pushthrough it, it makes you good at so manyother things outside of software, too.As I said, I learned this fromskateboards. And I would not be theengineer, and I certainly wouldn't bethe YouTuber I am today if skateboardinghadn't taught me to think the way Ithink and to do things the way I dothem. And believe me, if I could havejust asked Claude to do the trick for meand it would have looked the same toeveryone outside, I'd have Claude doingkick flips over cars without eventhinking twice. Especially if that was athing when I was getting into it. Ohman. Oh man. That would have ruined myentire life as a skater. And I probablywould have quit skating a year or two ininstead of doing it for 20 years.Now, there's one last important thing totalk about here. It's kind of on theexpectation setting piece, but it's a aweird way of thinking. This is going tobe a chart describing your compensationeffectively. So, going up we have salaryand going to the right we have time.It's really intuitive to think as a dev,your salary just goes up over time. Thisis the most unrealistic chart you couldpossibly use to think about howcompensation works in a field likesoftware dev. This might be how YouTubecompensation works. Probably a littlemore curved. This might be how sales foryour SAS or the MR for your productgoes. This might be the number of linesin your codebase. But this is not howyour compensation works. The harshreality of compensation in the techfield is it's going to be zero until youhit a certain point and then all of asudden it's going to be pretty high andit's going to stay there for a bit andthen you'll get a promotion. You'll getanother promotion. This is how yoursalary is going to work in the devworld. And this feels awful becauseyou're imagining this. Hell, you mighteven be imagining this. Like halfwaythrough college, you figured yourout. Maybe you got an internship. Maybehere you got a little internship andthen immediately you were back down tonothing for the rest of college and nowyou feel trapped. That sucks. And now inthe current era, especially like postlayoffs world, that doesn't existanymore. So now you're in this weirdlimbo area here where you don't knowenough to get the job that pays youthis. You're not qualified yet to behere, but you don't get anything forbeing here. So the weird reality islike, and this is going to be very USjobmarketcentric. You don't start at 20Kand work your way up. If you're notworth $100,000 a year as a software devin the US, you're worth zero dollars ayear as a software dev in the US. Andthat sucks because if you're not above acertain quality bar, like if we drawthis out as a a bar to represent whenyou can get a job, until you can crossthis line, you cannot make money as adev. And that sucks. Previously, it wasso hard to find devs that this bar waslowered and people were allowed to makethese salaries that probably shouldn'thave been. But the reason they did thatwas it was so hard to find people atthese ranges that they would bet onsomebody at a lower tier here in hopesthey would be so good they could bepromoted to these roles and deliver goodquality in the next 2 to 3 years. It wasa bet. It was an investment. It's not aninvestment that makes any sense to makenow. So what do we do? How do we getaround this? There's another way tothink of this quality bar, the the barfor whether or not someone should behired. Don't think of this just as areyou good enough or not. Because even ifyou're theoretically a god dev that isbetter than all the senior plus+ peoplemaking $4,000 or more a year doesn't getyou anything if you don't have trustyet. The most important thing today, thething in the most short supply is trust.Previously, the combination of the moneywe had and the number of potential hiresthat we had meant that the lack of trustfor the people we could possibly hirewas whatever. We just hire whoever andhope it went well. To go back to mydecision here, I knew I could trustpeople one and two because they werealready on my team. I could probablytrust person three because they alreadyworked at the company. I knew the peoplewho hired them. I knew the team theywere on, the people there. I could lookat their commits and see, oh, they'repretty good. Person four was an intern.We had paid them a smaller amount ofmoney to figure out if they were good ornot. Figured out they were really goodand immediately grabbed them as quicklyas we could. And person five, they had arole at a different company that theyperformed well in. It was worth takingthe risk, rolling the dice, and hopingthey would do well because they did wellin the interview and their previousexperience showed they were likelyqualified for this role. If we needed tohire more people here more aggressively,we could very easily have had a personsix that we didn't know as much aboutthat was more of a risky bet because wedidn't have enough people we trusted tofill the slots. If I have a stack ofresumes from like different people,these aren't just ranked by thepotential quality. These certainlyaren't ranked by which school you got adegree from. I'm going to rank this pileof the likelihood that this person willperform well in the role. And I'm notcalculating that based on all the funthings you put in your resume.Certainly not. I'm ranking these basedon how much I trust that you can pullthat off. So, how can you build thattrust? If you don't work at my company,I can't see your code unless you'reposting it publicly, then I can. And I'mnot saying go spam a bunch of repos withopen source commits. I have a wholevideo about why contributing to opensource is not the key to getting a job.But if you're already building, you'realready watching videos like mine,you're taking part in this ecosystem,show your work a bit. Maybe write a blogpost about how you tried two differentsolutions and what you liked and didn'tlike about them. Give me things I cansee to trust the fact that you havechallenged yourself and you havebettered yourself, that you're not justgenerating templates with AI things andposting them to a GitHub repo hoping toget a job. What you'll learn as you getmore senior is it's pretty easy to seefrom how someone's talking about a thingif they know what the they'retalking about or not and if they knowthat or not. If I was to read a blogpost from a junior engineer I was like Itried these two solutions. I didn'tunderstand this part but I didunderstand this other part and I likedit a lot. So that's how I made mydecision. I don't care that you said youdidn't know the other thing. In factthat's a good signal because now I knowI can trust you more because when youdon't know something you're going totell me. If you're willing to admit thatpublicly, you're certainly going to bedown to admit it to your team. That'sawesome. But if you're talking about abunch of tech you don't understand andI'm reading a paragraph and realize atthe end, oh, you chat gpt what is Reactand pasted it in here. You don't knowanything about any of this. And I gocheck your GitHub and you have yourReact website and the website isliterally a single JavaScript file thatis a single component where you pastedsomeone else's HTML template in. Iyou not. I saw that twice fromcandidates applying to work at Twitchwhere they had a React site that wasjust an HTML template pasted into asingle component. No state, no logic,nothing. It's just a shittier way ofdoing HTML. And if none of those wordsmeant anything to you, you're not readyfor your first job yet. And that's fine.Get back to learning. Stop watching myvideos. They're just going to distractyou. Go build The thing I want toemphasize, and it's a really importantpoint, it's surprisingly easy to showthat you care. If you want this, if youwant to be a good dev, if you want toimprove, you want to learn, you want tochallenge yourself, it comes off veryquickly. I don't think I'm that specialin the fact that I could see it. I wasconcerned as I got more popular that I'dhave my chat with hundreds of peoplewatching live and I wouldn't be able totell who gets it and who doesn't. Buttwo interesting things happened. Eventhough I've gotten much bigger, thepeople who show up here aren't the devsthat are pretending they know how tocode. For the most part, the people whoshow up here are the ones who care themost, that want to spend their sparetime learning about what's the bestsolution to these different problems, totalk about the fun things going on inthe React world, to go deep on new AIstuff. They're here because they care.And even then, even though the bar to behere in the first place is higher thanaverage, the outstanding people stillstand out. And that's a thing that I amso lucky is the case that I was reallyconcerned about when I got more popular.Outstanding people will always standout. Even in a chaotic world where thereare way more people trying to get a jobthan there are devs necessary to buildthings. Even as the amount of money wehave in the industry is going down, evenas AI is destroying all of thesejuniors, outstanding people still standout. When an awesome person shows up inmy chat, it's not that hard to noticebecause even if they are way morejunior, even if they're still incollege, maybe they're a year or twointo coding, the way they ask questions,the thought they put behind their wordsand the effort they put in to betterthemselves, it's always noticeable. Andif you happen to be applying to a placeor interviewing with somebody that can'tsee that, that's their problem andyou're dodging a bullet. But from myexperience, the people who care enoughto challenge themselves, to learn, togrow, to do better, they tend to end upin the same places that people like meend up. People like my team end up. Infact, that's how my team formed. It wasall people that hung out in the sameplaces as me, cared about the samethings I cared about, and showeddemonstrated that care. and anythingfrom an informative question to a reallyinteresting link in the question of heywhat do you think about this thoseconversations and interactions andresources that are formed around thosethings that's how you stand out and in aworld where you're not competing withfive resumes but you're competing with500 to 5,000 AI generated slop garbageapplications you don't solve thisproblem by being slop AI generatedapplication number 5,0001. You don'tsolve it by buying someone's course onhow to make a good resume. You don'tsolve it by making a bunch of crappychatgbt generated things on your GitHuband use it to flex the commit counts.You do it by caring. You do it bygetting better. You do it by not relyingon the AI to do the hard things, butfalling in love with doing those hardthings yourself. You got to get yourfeet wet. And when you do that, when youdive in, when you spend your time inthese spaces challenging yourself inthese ways, the likelihood you get tothat 100k role goes up a ton. Because ifyou're currently here, in order to getto a higher quality, in order to get upto the point where you can be hired atthat 100k range, you have to challengeyourself and grow. But you also have tobe noticed. So if you can find ways tocombine the two to do the thing thatgrows you in a way that also increasesyour visibility and presence in thespace, your likelihood of findingsuccess goes up exponentially. But ifevery time you run into one of theproblems, one of the challenges, one ofthe the details that make you a greatengineer, you ask Claude to do it foryou, you'll just never hit that pointbecause every time you ask Claude tosolve the problem, you've robbedyourself of the opportunity to solve ityourself. You've robbed yourself of theopportunity to hang out in the communityto learn answers from them. You'verobbed yourself of the opportunity toform a really good question to asksomebody who will remember that in thefuture. And if you rob yourself ofenough of those opportunities, allthat's left is slop. And if you don'ttake them, you don't push yourself totake those challenging important things,you'll never cross that line. It'seasier than ever to stop progressing andlet the tools do the work for you. Yougot to do the work yourself. And ifyou're one of those few people, thereare more of you than you think. Andfunny enough, the people who are likethis often don't even know it. I know alot of people that are here that areabove the skill level that would getthem even 150k plus a year that justdon't know it themselves or sometimesare insecure and don't trust itthemselves. They need to do more of thework publicly so they can first offcompare themselves to the people aroundthem and know. But more importantly,they can be noticed by somebody who's inthat range that will say, \"Ohyou're as good of an engineer as I am.Wait, you're still washing dishes for aliving? What the fuck?\" And now you'rethe first person in that person's headwhen they do need to hire somebody. So,it doesn't really matter where yourcurrent level is. If you show up withthe honest goal to improve withthoughtful questions about the thingthat you're trying to improve in, andyou put in the honest work to do it,you'll be amazed at how quickly peoplestart to catch on to that. I've seen16year-olds run laps around people wayhigher up in the salary range than theycould possibly be just cuz they caredenough to. And those people will alwaysstand out. You should try to be likethose people. Your goal shouldn't be tohit that salary level. Your goal shouldbe to have conversations with people atthose salary levels to be part of theconversation with them. And I did thisentirely subconsciously when I was atTwitch. If we change this to likejunior, midle, senior, I very quicklyfound myself primarily talking withpeople making twice as much money as mebecause I was just interested in thethings they were doing and they lovedme. I I've had so many conversations inmy past that I didn't realize theimportance of until much later wherepeople who I didn't know or even carehow much money they made compared to me.I just knew they owned the thing that Iwas interested in or excited about and Iwould ask them questions about thesethings and they loved it. If you asksomebody a good question about a thingthat they care about, one of two thingshappens. Either they answer becausethey're excited to talk about it or theydon't because your judgment was wrong.They don't actually care that much aboutit. You'd be amazed how well thisscales, especially with traditionalengineers doing traditional engineeringwork. I'm a little flooded. I'm tired ofall the crazy like essays in DMs I get.Like pro tip, and I should give this onemore often because it annoys me. Hey,Theo, I was hoping I could ask you aboutsomething. Here's my life story. Istarted coding when I was fourparagraphs later. So, what do you think?Should I use X, Y, and Z, or should I reredo A, B, and C? This is the format ofthe majority of the DMs I get. What the Some amount of these are becauseof lack of general social ability. Iunderstand that. Some amount of it iscuz I'm a highly visible person. So,when someone who doesn't know how totalk has a question, they end up in my DMs half the time. Here's abetter example. In your video about X, Inoticed you did Y. I'm a bit confusedbecause I thought Y was for Z. Do youhave any resources for me to betterunderstand Z? This is phenomenal. I willremember you if this is how you DM me.Start with the context. Give me a simplehere's the thing that led me here. Showwhere your misunderstanding is in thesimplest teeniest part possible and thenmake the ask. Notice how none of this isabout the person. None of this is abouttheir journey. None of this is a storyabout their life. It is startingwith the context that led them to myDMs. clarifying what they're here forand what the the missing piece is andthen explicitly asking not for me topersonally teach it to them, but topoint them in the right direction. Thereason they're here is clear. The reasonthey're in my DM specifically is clear.The thing they need is clear, and theask is super clear and low effort andlow friction for me. This is an awesomeDM. Notice how I get none of that here.I have no clarity why they're hitting meup. Are they hitting me up because I'mpopular? Are they hitting me up becausethey think I'm rich? Are they hitting meup because they think I can magicallyhand them a job? Probably somecombination of those, honestly. None ofwhich are reasons I want to talk tosomebody. If you're only reaching out tome because you think I can get you ajob, I don't want to talk to you. Ifyou're reaching out to me because Italked about a thing you're genuinelyinterested in, you are struggling tograsp one of the concepts and you wanthelp getting through that tiny piece,and you come to me with the smallestpossible ask, which is a link to a thingwhere you can learn more about it. Thesecouldn't be more different to me. And ifyou can't see the difference betweenthese two DMs, I I'll just say it rightlike go to speech therapy. It'll help.It'll save your life as someone who hadto themselves. The difference betweenthese is an essential thing tounderstand as a functional human being.And because so much of the I get isthis, it's really easy to stand out withthis. I almost want to pull up my Twitchchat right now and highlight some ofthese things, but I won't do it. I don'twant to be mean and bully people thatway. I just want to emphasize the factthat simple, clear, concisecommunications that are relevant to theperson you're reaching out to are soimportant. And if you can get good atthat, this is such a rare skill inengineering that I'll hire you for thiseven if I don't know how good your codeis. One of my community members in chatright now in bed, I hired her to helpwith a lot of the video process becauseshe was always so concise and clear witheverything she did. She was more likelyto drop a useful link than she was todrop an essay about some She wasso useful and asked the right questionsand brought the right resources that Ibrought her on to help with the videoreview and like information gatheringprocess and she's significantly improvedhow fast we can get videos out. And whenshe hits me up with interest in othercompanies, I am so happy to write her areferral places. We also have Gabriel inmy chat here who was similarly supersuper helpful. Was almost always the onedropping the links that I was coveringand like the right links and sources forthe things I was talking about live. Ihit him up like I feel bad that I'm notpaying you to do this. So I startedpaying Gabriel learned how hilariouslyunderpaid he was as an engineer inVenezuela. Yeah. And since then, he hasgotten a much better job from a referralfrom me. And I kind of screwed myselfbecause he doesn't have as much time tohelp us out anymore cuz he has a realfull-time engineering job. But all ofthis came from the fact that thesepeople cared enough and just by caringand talking about what they care about,they stood out really quickly. Learningto ask good questions isn't a skill youshould learn on the job. I kind of gotaway with that, but also was deep enoughin forums and other communities becauselike common problem I would have back inthe days of Minecraft server hosting isI'd be using two plugins that weren'tcompatible or there would be someproblem and if I was to go to the forumfor one of those plugins like hey I'mtrying to use craft bucket with worldguard you get the idea this isnonsense and the response to this wouldbe equally nonsense or flaming me orjust no reply at all. But if I came inwith, hey, I get specific error whentrying to do specific thing. I triedcommon debug step to no avail. I saw twoother users with this problem. How can Ihelp fix it? Oh man, the response youget here resulted in a dumb 15-year-oldTheo contributing to World Guard. Like,it's it's crazy how easy it is once yourealize there's a human on the otherside perceiving the thing. And if youtreat people like me, if you treat thesesenior engineers like boxes that youthrow data at and hope you get some databack, you're not being a good junior.You're not actually taking theopportunity to learn and grow. You'retrying to use the people who are higherup than you. This message is someonetrying to use me to make money. Thismessage is somebody trying to betterthemselves that happens to use mycontent as a method of doing suchgenuinely asking for help improvingthemselves. And if you want to go 10times further with this, if I give youthe resource for this and it makessomething click for you, if your next DMto me is, \"Thanks so much. This helped abunch of things click for me. I knowit's a bit of a big ask, but I wrote ablog post detailing the parts Istruggled with. Would you be down togive it a quicklook? Oh man, the speed at which I wouldput this person on my do hire list isunbelievable. God, if that blog post isgood, I'm going to hand you every jobopportunity that gets thrown in mydirection. First and foremost, oldmaterials for how to get a job the oldway is dead. The gap between the numberof roles available, the number of peoplelooking for those roles and all of thatmeans you can't just leak code your wayto your first job anymore. That's not athing. And even if you do, the placeyou'll end up is going to be Youdon't want to be there. thing too, youhave to be good to get a job. Kind ofplays into point one, but now more thanever, it's hard for a company to justifyhiring someone who isn't there yet whenthere are 10 people who already arelooking for the role. There used to beso few engineers that it was better torisk it on someone not qualified andtrain them up. That's not the caseanymore. It's just not worth it. Thatmeans you have to train yourself, whichmeans you have to stop relying on AItools to get through the hard parts. Andthis is hard. This is difficult becauseit's human instinct to do that. Whensomething is hard, like when you take abite of some food and it's too hot, youspit it out instinctively because it'sbad for you. It's human instinct to shyaway from hard things, especially whenyou're given an easy solution. But youhave to kick the habit because if youdon't, you'll never hit the level thatyou need to in order to get one of theseroles. But even if you are there, evenif you are good enough to have the job,you have to build trust to get it. Youwill not get that job if there aren'tpeople in the industry who have seenwhat you're capable of. And I'm notsaying, as I mentioned before, spamGitHub with crappy open source repos andspam maintainers with crappy pollrequests. I'm saying be present in thespace. be part of the conversation, askinteresting questions, and don't wastemy time when you do it. If you canfigure those things out, it might takelonger than it used to to get a job. Youmight come out of college and be hangingout in these communities for two yearswhile you're doing a part-time gig, butyou will make it. You just have to careenough and not give up. And if you don'tdo those things, if you slack on any ofthese parts, if you don't push yourselfthrough the hard stuff, you don't takepart in the community, and you don't dothe necessary pieces to build trust andbuild yourself, you're not going to luckthrough it. Previously, you'd basicallyjust throw your resume at enoughcompanies that one would be desperateenough to hire you. And that's how I gotin. The way I got in is done. The way Igot into this industry is closed now.And it feels bad giving advice to peoplewho are in a very different positionthan I was where I wouldn't have doneall of this and I wouldn't have gottenthe job. But I'm on the other side now.I do a lot of hiring. I help a lot ofother companies with hiring. I thinkabout these things a lot. And if I wasthinking about somebody who deeplyunderstood these things, who asked mereally good questions and showedmeaningful growth over the last year orso, I don't care if they ever had a jobbefore. I'm hiring that person waybefore I hire a more experienced devthat I don't have that level of trustwith. Trust is a rare commoditynowadays. And if you can find ways tobuild it while also building upyourself, you're going to kill it. Ihave no concerns for you. But if youstruggle through the hard parts of aproblem, you solve them with Claude, andthen you DM me a life essay abouthelping you get a job, you're not goingto make it. You're so far from thereality we live in that I can't helpyou. You need to reset yourself andreset the expectations. You need to stopacting like you deserve a thing youdon't understand. You need to take astep back, evaluate if you care or not.Evaluate if you want to be a betterengineer and evaluate why. If you'redoing it, if you're trying to hit thisbar so you can get the job and get paid,that era is closing fast. But if you'redoing this because you played games as akid and were blown away with the magicof seeing code turn into things movingon your screen. If you're doing thisbecause there's applications you usethat are frustrating you and you want tofix them. If you're doing this becauseyou have a genuine love of the craft orcuriosity of the technology. If you'redoing it for those reasons, keep doingit and keep showing it. I got in forMinecraft. I got in I I mean I wasplaying with code much younger, but Istarted taking it seriously because Iwanted to host Minecraft servers. Andone last thing, stuff I'm not sayingbecause when I do these rants, peoplelove to fill them with things that I didnot say at all. So, let's put a coupleof these in. I'm not saying don't use AItools. There's a lot of great things touse these AI tools for.Don't Hey, cursor, solve this error forme. do going to self plug a little go toT3 chat I'm running into this particularerror what might be the cause errorpasted here awesome using the AI toimprove your understanding of a thinghell I'm struggling to understand howReact rendering works can you give mesimple breakdown I do understand howUnrealengine rendering works. Maybe use thatas a comparison. Awesome. Great use ofAI. Using it to better yourself, not toavoid bettering yourself in order tobetter your code. Awesome. A+ onceyou've built these skills, using the AIto solve problems that are I don't saythem beneath you. Like if there's aproblem that I know how to solve and Idon't feel like it, AI is awesome forthat. If there's a thing I don't knowand I want to learn about it, AI is goodfor that. there's a thing I don't feellike learning. AI will make it so easyto never learn it and never actuallyimprove. And finding that balance iskey. And if you're struggling with thebalance, that's fine. Throw away the AItools, revisit them later. But if youcan find if if you can understand thisdifference, using AI to help you bebetter, not to help avoid gettingbetter, that can be good. So I'm notsaying don't use AI tools. I'm sayingdon't use AI tools instead of improvingyourself. Another thing I am certainlynot saying is give up. It's not worthit. Now is a better time than ever to bean engineer. On one hand, getting thatfirst role is harder. On the other hand,climbing up, rewriting everything aroundyou, bettering yourself in the industryand making real impactful change atscales unimaginable is more possible nowthan ever. Some of the most impactfulpeople I met made that impact 6 monthsafter their first gig. People like ShadCen, as far as I know, didn't have afull-time engineering gig before workingat Forcell. How crazy is that? That thelead architect behind so much of thecraziness with Shad Cen UI and Vzero wasjust a guy working on Don't giveup. Once you're through, you can havemore impact than you can even imagine.Now, it's a better time than ever to getin if you care. It is a miserable timeto get in if you don't. So, I will dothe 2.5. If you don't care, rip that.that I am saying. That I am definitelysaying. But if you're here in the firstplace, if you're however many minutesinto this video, you probably care morethan most, you'll you'll be fine. Youbelong here. I am also definitely notsaying give up on GitHub. I'm sayingdon't expect GitHub to be a magicalthing to get you a job. I'm not sayingdon't contribute to things you use. I'msaying don't hunt for GitHub repos tospam with crappy PR so that you canclaim you contributed to things. But ifyou're using a tool and you're runninginto a problem and you cut a detailedissue with a reproduction process andmaybe even a stack blitz link and thenyou offer to do a pull request to fixit, that is so easy to hire for. It'sunbelievable. If you can do that wholeprocess, awesome. That's way moreimportant than how well you know acertain framework. I ain't even vaguelyhinted this, but people love accusing meof saying this. You can't get a job ifyou don't learn React. I've never saidanything even vaguely like this, so Idon't know why it keeps coming up, butfelt obligated to call that out here.You can get a job. Like, half the Ihired weren't React engineers when Ihired them. I don't care. Use whateveryou care enough about to get excitedwhen you talk about it. I am also, Lastthing I'm not saying. Certainly notsaying spam random famous people in thespace with your dumb questions.Absolutely not saying this. If anything,my little section here, I would hope Iknow it won't do this, but I would hopethat this results in me getting fewerDMs. I know that's not how it's going towork, but I can dream. Okay, I want tomake sure people like myself are treatedas a last effort resource where you putthe effort in to solve the problemyourself and you come to me when there'sa missing piece you can't you just can'tclose the loop for in your head. That'sawesome. But don't reach don't findsomeone to spam with every singlequestion as you're going. Do your bestto take advantage of the resources thatpeople like me create. And when you'vereach the limits of those resources,very calmly, kindly, and thoughtfully,reach out to the right people to do it.But the restraint you use for thatoutreach is as important as the qualityof the outreach itself. The way you hitme up is as important as me being theright person to hit up. If you'rehitting me up because I'm famous andrich, you. If you're hitting me upbecause I'm the only person who's talkedabout this particular thing you careabout in a way that's exciting to youand understandable to you and you don'tknow anyone else that you could possiblyask about the thing, you've alreadylooked through all your resources andcan't find anything and you come to mewith a really clear small ask. Awesome.Do that all day. I'll do my best torespond to all those. I still do. I'malways behind on DMs, but I've repliedto people with zero followers far moretimes than any of you would imaginebecause they hit me up with a reallygood question. Or one other fun thing,hitting me up with a solution to aproblem I have. Yo here created areally, really cool plugin. PrettyTypeScript errors because the formattingof TypeScript errors in VS Code wasgarbage. I would complain about it alot. Others did too. He hit me up onDiscord with a, \"Hey, big fan. I noticedyou were fighting with TypeScript errorsin your editor. I do all the time. Ibuilt this little plugin that makes themlook like this screenshot of what theylook like. Link to the GitHub repo.\" Itwas like three sentences, not even. Ilooked at I was like, \"Wow, that is waybetter.\" I went and installed it andthis is the VS Code extension I wouldstruggle the most to move on from. Ineed this at this point. And I almostimmediately rushed out a video on itbecause I was so blown away. And I havegiven Yoo here every possible jobopportunity I think even vaguely makessense for him because he solved a realproblem in a super practical way andcommunicated it incredibly well. I don'tthink he's a native English speaker, buthe puts so much effort into every wordof his DM to me. I don't care. It'sclear he can communicate well and showvalue while also providing solutions toreal problems. And if you can hit all ofthose, if you can communicate well, ifyou can put effort into solvingproblems, identify the right problems,and show the work for those solutions ina way that'sconsiderate, you're going to kill it.And I'm not expecting everyone to getthis right first try. You're going tostumble. You're going to make mistakes.But I'm not saying any of these things.I'm not saying don't do it. I'm notsaying give up. I'm certainly not sayingspam us. Saying be thoughtful in how youlearn and grow and challenge yourself tokeep getting better regardless of whereyou're going to be tomorrow. And as longas you do that, as long as you thinkthrough what it means to improve as adev, as long as you care enough to putthe work in every day, you're going tomake it. So don't give up. Just keeppushing. It's harder than it was for me.And I really hope this isn't coming offas me gatekeeping and pulling the ladderup from behind me. I'm trying my best todo the opposite. To point at the ladder,the much harder to use ladder than itwas when I got started. to make sure thepeople who care enough to get up herewith me make it. And I hope this helps acouple of you get there. Even if justone of you does, this one was worth it.And to the half of you who haven't hitthe sub button yet, what the Howare you this far in the video? And I'mputting all this work in for free, bythe way. You're not goingto Anyways, sorry for being a littleselfish at the end. This is a lot ofwork. This is like, do you see how muchwe drew here today? It's almost lookinglike a milky dock at this point.Anyways, that's all I got to say on thisone. Hopefully, this is helpful to you.If not, I'm sorry. If yes, awesome.Excited to see where you end up in a fewyears. And if in a year or two you endup with that job and this video was insome way helpful for you to get there,send me a DM about it. Those are myfavorite DMs. The, \"Hey, this one randomthing you said flipped my brain and nowI'm doing well.\" That's a cool DM tosend. And I really hope you get to sendthat one someday. Until next time, hopethis helps. Keep coding, nerds, and andstop letting AI solve all your problemsfor you. Seriously, you're just going todestroy your entire career if you stopactually solving problems and just letClaude do all the",
    "summary": "The video addresses the question of whether junior developers are \"screwed\" in the current tech landscape, arguing that while it's undeniably harder to get a first job, it's still possible to succeed. The speaker explains how the industry has shifted, with fewer developers needed per feature, a larger pool of available developers, and increased company optimization. This means the leverage previously enjoyed by developers, where companies desperately needed them, has diminished. The speaker shares his own experience of getting a job despite being underqualified initially, emphasizing the importance of being liked and showing potential.\n\nThe speaker stresses the importance of embracing hard work and resisting the temptation to rely solely on AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT. He draws a parallel to skateboarding, where falling and getting hurt are essential parts of learning. He urges junior developers to challenge themselves, feel comfortable with being wrong, and avoid shortcuts that prevent them from developing problem-solving skills. He advocates for active participation in the community, demonstrating a genuine interest in learning and sharing knowledge, which builds trust. The speaker suggests creating a public presence to showcase competence and to network. He also offers advice on how to reach out to senior engineers effectively, emphasizing clarity, conciseness, and a focus on specific questions, not personal stories.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that building trust is paramount and that companies are less willing to take risks on unproven candidates. Demonstrating a commitment to improvement and a willingness to engage with the community are key differentiators. He refutes common misconceptions, such as the need to spam GitHub with low-quality contributions or the necessity of learning specific frameworks like React. He encourages aspiring developers to focus on asking thoughtful questions and finding solutions to real problems, which will ultimately lead to opportunities and success. His closing message emphasizes that hard work and a genuine love for the craft can lead to a fulfilling career, even in today's challenging environment."

    "transcript": "have not heard any other companies wherethe largest outages are taken soseriously by everyone the wholeleadership chain operational excellenceand dives deep and all these kind ofthings tie in together and there's thisculture which you know sometimes peoplecomplain about like new external hiressometimes Amazon has had these pocketsof a bunch of VPs hired from a differentcompany or they don't join the on calldon't join this F1 and it's like oh mygod these bad external people who don'tunderstand how we do things but I wouldsay yeah the longtime Amazonians like wewould sometimes have for example in AWSyou'd have the engineers mirrors callwhere they're all discussing fixes andthen sort of separately like there'salso the VP SVP call of like give us theupdates, what's the current status andsome of this is a scale thing, right?Like Netflix is down in like half thecountry because there's some globalnetworking outage and we're like talkingto the backbone providers trying to getthem to fix things faster. We're tellingthem exactly where the backbone brokebecause our alerts are much better thantheirs. I was shocked sometimes that theconnections that you have and the datayou have sometimes are somind-bogglingly big. What is it like towork at Amazon as a software engineer?Dave Anderson was an engineering managerand director of engineering at Amazonfor more than 12 years. He's now retiredand so can speak with more candid thanusual. In our conversation, we coverengineer and manager career levels atAmazon from L4 to L10, the interviewprocess for engineers and Amazon'sunique bar raiser interview, Amazon'sinfamous PIP/underperformer target andhow performance management actuallyplays out on call and incidentmanagement inside Amazon and many moretopics. If you're interested inunderstanding how Amazon worksdifferently than most big tech companiesand why startups often have success inhiring engineers and engineering leadersfrom Amazon, this episode is for you. Ifyou enjoy the show, please subscribe tothe podcast on any podcast platform andon YouTube.Dave, welcome to the podcast. Thanks.Glad to be here. So, you've you'veworked at Amazon as an engineeringmanager as a how is Amazon called? SDM.SDM. Yeah. Yeah. I started off as an SDMand then went up that engineeringmanagement chain. You were you're asoftware development manager. Before weget into what it's like to work as a devmanager there, you you manage and workwith a lot of software engineers, whatis it like to be a software developerand what levels does Amazon have for fordevs and also for managers and how dothey overlap? Yeah, the the the numbersoverlap except for um so when you gethired out of college like the the entrylevel that lasts like a year and a halfto sometimes more years uh is levelfour. That's for whatever reason westart at level four for engineers. Uhthen there's level five which is likethe beginnings of middle level engineerwhich equates to the first level of SDM.Uh Amazon technically has SDM at levelfive and six. Level five is more rareand it's more for you know you almostwant to call it junior except no onewould want to call it junior SDM becauseit'd be a little insulting. Um that'sactually where I started. Um so there'slevel five and then level six is whatyou might what called a senior softwareengineer uh or a software developmentmanager uh which is like the softwaredevelopment manager level six is themost common management position whereyou manage a two pizza team you you ownyour space and uh you usually don't havemanagers underneath you uh and that'ssenior software engineer which is whereI would say a lot of softwareengineering careers end as in that's asenior position you're uh you could uhalmost equate it to like a level sixmanager has a level six engineer in aperfect perfectly designed team which isa level six engineer would sort of bethe head engineer for a team and then uhyou hit level seven at Amazon which isprincipal software engineer uh and theywould theoretically be over a group ofteams the lead you know sort ofdirecting you know and as you couldimagine as you get to like larger groupsyou get to more broad ownership. So, uha principal engineer would wouldn't benecessarily focused on one systembecause you're theoretically leadingacross multiple teams. So, you get moreand more architecture, you know, biggerscale designs, things like that. Um andthat equates to level seven manager,which is senior software developmentmanager, uh which would be a manager ofmanagers, the first level where you'rereally managing multiple teams. Then youget to level eight which is uh uh seniorprincipal engineer uh which is just moresenior bigger orgs bigger scope etcwhich equates to director for uhdevelopmentmanagement and then you get up to level10 because there's no nine for whateverreason. Um I don't know if I ever got astraight answer on why there's no nine.It was like you know this idea of like asenior director position that never gotcreated. Um but anyway, you jump up to10 and you get to distinguish engineeror uh VP. Um which is sort of, you know,the pinnacle of where any of us normalhumans would get to. This episode isbrought to you by work OS.

This episode is brought toyou by Modal, the cloud platform thatmakes AI development simple. Need GPUswithout the headache? With Modal, justadd one line of code to any Pythonfunction and boom, it's running in thecloud on your choice of CPU or GPU. Andthe best part, you only pay for what youuse. With sub-second container start andinstant scaling to thousands of GPUs,it's no wonder companies like Sunno,RAM, and Substack already trust Modalfor their AI applications. Getting anH100 is just a PIP install away. Go tomodal.com/pragmatic to get $30 in freecredits every month. That is m od.com/pragmatic. Why do you think itstarts with L4? This is so strangebecause at Google, Uber, I think evenpotentially Stripe, it all starts at L3.It's also for a historic reason, but L4at most companies is is like themid-level engineer. And here at Amazon,it's the entry- level one. And I I don'teven know why like it. It's not like wedon't have different pay scales. So So II'm pretty sure if you get to the FC'sthat I I don't remember the levels forthe FC workers that there's like one,two, and three, and like you know thattheir leveling uh fulfillment center.Sorry. Fulfillment centers. So when youget to the fulfillment centers, of whichI've had very little to do in my career,so like, you know, once in a while Itouch on something. So I'm pretty surethat their levels start lower. Um,and if you get to a few weird positionslike uh QA was a position which I don'tknow exists anymore. It existed and thendidn't and then existed again anddidn't. So I don't know what the currentstatus is. It was a quality assurancetester which is like a non not like QAEwhich is quality assurance engineer. uhthey would be level three. So there'slike this weird quirks where you'd touchlevel three once in a while, but for themost part, yeah, Amazon just starts offat level four. Um no idea why theydecided their numbering schemes needs tostart there. And how easy or ordifficult are promotions? I think youkind of alluded a little bit to thatwhen you said that a lot of people getstuck at L6, which is the senior level.Yeah, I would I would say the like fourto five for engineers isn't too bad atall or or or for just about anyposition. I mean, you know, there'slevel fours for uh some other roles. Umbut, uh I would say that's not too hard.If you're competent, you complete yourprojects on time, you hit like two yearsin or so on and most teams and they'rejust going to end up promoting you.Like, hey, look, they because the ideaof like a level four is sort of like youneed assistance. You know, imaginehiring someone straight out of college.Like there's very few college hires whoare competent enough to be handed aproject and actually work on it. It'sjust just think about how you were incollege. like you you finished, are youreally ready to work on like large scalework now? Like someone's sitting overyour shoulder helping you, explainingwhat you're doing wrong, like don'tforget to test before you push. Um solevel five is sort of like you can betrusted to work on a project, not a hugeproject, but a decent sized project atthe start of level five at least um onyour own. So hopefully after a year anda half or two years of work, you'verepeatedly demonstrated that you canwork on your own. So you're promoted tolevel five. Past that you get to a lotharder. So there's this very detaileddocument of the criteria for what's thedifference between level four to five,five to six, six to seven for both forevery position at Amazon actually likethere's a big archive in SharePoint lastI saw um which was uh just the detailedof like at level five you and itdescribes it in fairly good detail. Um Imean hand wavy as you could imagine interms of uh a a project with the scopeof a team, a project with the scope ofmultiple teams. Yeah. Um so those areactually what's mostly used whenmanagers uh go to write promotions. SoAmazon's in comparison to a lot ofcompanies. Amazon has a very documentculture. I mean for for everythingincluding projects, the famous sixpagers, right? Yeah. Yeah. And so youwrite a famous six-pager for promotionsas well. And so uh oh even forpromotions for even for promotions andit's actually um I would say one of theaspects that's the hardest for managersand one of the big differentiatorsbetween a having a good manager and notis and one of the reasons you want amanager who can write is that yourpromotion document is the thing thatgets you promoted or not. Um I justcontrast that quickly with I I worked atface Facebook for a bit meta now. Um,and I remember being in OR there and amanager said like, \"Oh, my engineer isso good. They really need to be promotedto level six.\" And a couple people said,\"Yeah, yeah. Are you sure?\" Like, \"Yeah,I remember. I heard they were good.\"Like, \"Yeah, they're good.\" Okay, soundsgood. Moving on. And flabbergasted. Iwas just like, my mind was blown. I'mlike, are you kidding me? Um because atAmazon, what you you have is this umdocument which has like a lot ofrequired fields where you have toexplainum like write this big narrative. Firstof all, there's some like normal fieldslike how long is their time in position?Uh which again is like a criteriathey'll look at and say like oh only 13months that's not very long. Are youreally sure you can proponent them thatfast? Like this it's a very uh um it's ahard process to get through let's saybut then you have to write thisnarrative multi-page narrativeexplaining how they meet the criteria ofthe next level. So you know everyone hasthe doc of here's what a level sixengineer does. You have to be able to,you know, read through that, understandwhat the the criteria is, and then youhave a narrative where you explain howthey've done that thing at the nextlevelrepeatedly. And then you need quite afew people at the next level or higheruh saying that they believe you have metthe criteria for the next level. Andthey usually have to give some anecdotesof why they're pretty convinced that youshould be promoted. Andso level four to five is pretty darneasy. again like you say they completedthis project, this project and thisproject and then a few level fiveengineers will write down saying, \"Yeah,yeah, totally cool. Thumbs up.\" Uh bythe time you get to like level seven tolevel eight, like it is serious amountsof documentation, lot you know, yearsworth of project completion. You have tohave a lot of VPs and directors on theirdock writing out narrative blocks oftext explaining all the things they'vedone with you. Um, and so I would saythat each level you go up, it gets Iwould probably say exponentially harderto get promoted, which is why four tofive is not a big deal. 5 to six is apretty big promotion. Six to seven issuper damn hard. Like it's alreadyhitting like levels of um slightly lessbad for management, which I can explainin a second why, but um principles havelike additional hurdles they have to getpast sort of unfairly in my mind. um uhlike technical assessments of exactlywhat they've done by multiple principleswho seem to have incentive to say no.It's it's really tough. Um and so uh umand I wouldsay in ways that makes it uh have thewrong incentives for managers. One ofthe big things for managers is how bigis their team? Because if you're a levelif you're a level six manager and overtime your team scope has grown and youeventually got some more managersreporting to you and then they get moreengineers and then you start gettingmore managers more engineers and someonelooks at your team and says uh this dudehas 55 people reporting to him and he'slevel six like that makes no sense. Wereally need to promote them. So, uh,managers had this sort of artificialpressure and incentive to get theirteams larger, which is until recentlywas one of the big things almosteveryone did was like a huge part ofyour job as a manager to grow yourcareer was just grow your scope, figureout more projects, more teams, moreeverything else. You could take on Yeah.more initiative. You can almostguarantee a promotion if you just growyour team enough. Yeah.Incentives are are an interestingthings. Yeah. Taking a step back, wetalked about what it's like to be insideAmazon and, you know, get get hired inthere. How do you get hired as as anengineer and and what what is theinterview process? Is it the prettystandard, you know, the ones we knowwhat Google and and Meta does, the youknow, algorithical coding interview,etc. Or are there some unique things forAmazon? For the most part, I would sayit was very very similar.Um, in fact, I would say at least when Iwent to Facebook, I was there for abouta week and I started getting added tointerview loops because they heard I wasa bar razer at Amazon, which I'llexplain bar razer in a second for anyonewho doesn't know. Um, but I got added tothe loops and I was like, \"Oh my god,like this is the exact same thing.\"Like, everyone's doing the same thing.It's extremely similar. Uh, at least thegroups I was in, we were I was justadded to the loops. It was exactly thesame. Nothing was different.Um so for the most part with someexceptions uh interview loops are youhave five people uh you do a phonescreen they they just sort of checkwhatever they feel like checking to makesure that you're like a vaguelycompetent candidate and then you have aninterview loop of of usually five peopleof which four is usually on the team oror closely related to the team and thenone person's the bar raiser who is aessentially a third party person who canvetoa higher decision and they also arerunning the loop as in um you're you'reputting someone who's very experiencedinterviewer on the loop to make surethat everything goes well, everyoneinterviews well, that you the loop isset up correctly and they have theability to say no. Um is like theirspecial power and so but they cannot sayyes, right? So they're not the hiringwho says yes? Is it the hiring manager?So a yes requires a yes from the hiringmanager and the bar raiser. So it's likea a combo decision. So either one ofthem can say no and it doesn't happen.Now in reality once you're there longenough there's lots of ways to getaround that as both the not not as ahiring manager. You can't really getaround the bar raiser but um as a barraiser a few times I've had hiringmanagers saying no. I'm like that'scool. I'll just pass them off to myfriend here as a hiringmanager like like dude quick quickbefore anyone else gets them. Um becausesometimes hiring managers have weirdopinions but um yeah for the most partit has to be yes from both the hiringmanager and the bar raiser. And thenlike I I think we can all imagine youknow the interview you're going throughas as a candidate correct me if I'mwrong but you know you apply to Amazonyou have the first screening you'reyou're through you're you're put on tomaybe you have a technical pre-screeningbut then you have the on-site or youknow it might be virtual but you'llprobably have coding architecture hiringmanager may maybe multiples of some ofthese you have all these interviewswhich we talked with all these peopleyou probably think you did great on someyou did on terrible some what happensbehind the scenes? How does a debriefhappen? So, the loop is set up and umthere's at no point Amazon's very bad atconsistency across all of Amazon. So,everything every just about everything Isay has a grain of salt. The only thingis not is like yes, bar raisers arealways included, but other than that,like I don't know how many times I'vesaid this is the way you do things andsomeone else is like not at all, you'retotally wrong. Which is funny becauselike we're both wrong. It's just um Iworked in a good number of groups so Ihave fair confidence that I've been inyou know like five six six groups atAmazon so like very different or so. SoI have a pretty good idea of what'sconsistent. Um you set up a loop withfor engineers for example you would haveusually like two codinginterviews a design interview if it's asenior engineer you'd add anarchitecture interview and then um atleast one leadership leadershipprinciple style interview which is likechecking your leadership skills. Um,level four interviews are sometimes alittle different because they have noleadership because they're college hiresand like it's a little bit of a waste oftime to spend much time asking themabout times they've had conflicts withco-workers. Like, well, they've had noco-workers. They they lived in a dorm.Like, I've heard some really weirdstories when I try to ask those kind ofquestions. Um, yeah, this one time my myuh my roommate was was staying up reallylate at night and I had a test in themorning. I'm like, \"Okay, maybe we justmove on.\" Okay. Um so, uh in normalinterviews with experienced people, youyou have all these things. Everyonetakes detailed notes on both thequestions they ask and the answers theygive and your interpretation. Likethere's three parts of a good interviewnotes. And everyone takes notes. You youinterview independently. You shouldn'tbe talking in between the interviews.Like each interviewer does their thing.And you take these notes. Then you getinto what we have as a debrief, a adiscussion about the candidate. So theraiser leads that meeting. You start offthe meeting for the most part. You startit off by saying, \"Okay, everyone read.\"So you all start reading and you readtypical across Amazon, right? A lot ofmeetings. Yeah. Amazon's documentculture here. It's like you start offand you say, \"Everyone read.\" And you'regoing to spend like if you have adepending on how long the debrief is,half an hour, hour. Like you sit thereand you read, you read the questions,you read the candidates's answers, youread the interpretation of thoseanswers. Um, and then how the rest of itproceeds is very much up to the barraiser. like their org and like how theytend to do things. Um I usually wouldsay like uh some version of now thatyou've read all the feedback are youchange because oh sorry part of the uhinterview notes is what is your vote forhigher or not hire and so I would sortof carefully go around and say like whatare your current thoughts on higher orno hire? Um not like are you I wouldusually not say are you going to changeyour mind because people are reluctantto change their mind. I like to say justlike now what are your current thoughts?You've read all the feedback. Um, andyou sort of get an idea of like where isthe room uh landing. In I would probablysay like 90% of the cases it's not allyes or all no. I would say almost alwaysthere's at least one no and one yes evenon the worst or best candidates. And soyou preferably then go through and tryto pressure test both directions of likewhat happens if we don't hire thisperson? Like are we missing somethingreally good or what happens if we hirethis person? What's the big risk thatwe're overlooking? And um the barraiser's main job is to make sure youhave a really good discussion that youdon't overly obsess with one little bitof feedback. You know, sometimes peopleare like, \"Oh my god, I hated thatanswer. Yeah, we need to say no.\" Andokay, that was one sentence given by thecandidate for one of the interviewerslike let's try not to obsess over thattoo much. But um uh in fact like as whatyou said was um sometimes you almostalways you'll have a good interview anda bad interview. like that's extremelycommon. And so hopefully what the barraiser is doing is making sure you havea good discussion over like everythingseen and and one of the reasons in factwhat we do to coding interviews almostalways is because it gives you morechances to have good answers. I don'tknow how many times I've heard oh yeahthey couldn't code their way out ofpaper bag and the other person says theydid just fine for me and now you have agood discussion like why do we get twovery different answers? What exactly didthey put as their answer for the otherperson? let's compare them, let's take alook, you know, what kind of hints didyou give, what kind of hints did you notgive? You know, uh, and you just try toarrive at the idea of like, should wehave them or not?So, is it fair to say that the barraiser tries to, you know, make the thedebrief a bit more fair? You know, evenout things, compensate for lessexperienced interviewers and and maybesome of their biases given the barraiser is it's both an experiencedinterviewer, but is is there like aspecial like training or or or like howdo you become a bar raiser? Yeah, forthe most part. Um, soyou again orwide like there's a lot ofdifferences across Amazon. For the mostpart, it's like once you've had a 100plus interviews, sometimes 50 you canstart training, but like usually 100ishinterviews is when you get to um trainas a bar raiser. And for the most part,the training is you watch a bar raiserdo their thing for a while and then youstart to do the bar razor thing whilethey watch and then criticize you behindyour, you know, later on. um criticize.Uh and that can last anywhere from like10 interviews to I've I've literallyI've seen 50 or plus more of like theykeep watching them and saying they'restill not ready to do this on their own.Um depending on how picky the bar raiseris and or how bad the person in trainingis. Um and uh but for the most part Iwould say in a lot of myinterviews I had more time interviewingthan everyone else combined. And so alot, you know, a lot of the bar raisersdo have 400, 500, 600 interviews undertheir belt. And a lot of theinterviewers have done 10, 15, 20. Like,so, so you are not just like a bit moretrusted, you are wildly more experiencedthan other people on the loop. And sovery frequently you're both a sort of alouder voice in the room in terms ofpeople can just trust your opinion onthese things butalso I will look at their question the cI don't know how many times I've seenlike the question the candidates'sanswer and then their interpretation Ithink is wrong. I'm like that's actuallya pretty good answer. I can see wherethey were going with this and you'relike absolutely wrong and I'm thinkingthat's actually not wrong. It's not it'san interesting you know it wasn't theapproach you liked but I actually seewhere they were going with that and Ithink it was fine. So, um I would saythat that's sort of where the bar raiserlike thing comes in is like trying tolike you said sort of fair like a fairevaluation of a candidate. Um becausewe're not trying to hire people who havethe exact answer you have like that youknow they want to hear. What you want tohire is people who can come up with goodanswers as they work here for manyyears. And so um you know one of thethings you're looking for for example ismore of like growth uh you know thepossibility of growth like is thisperson willing to hear things you knowsometimes it'll be in the firstinterview they said this by the lastinterview they said this other thing I'mlike that's interesting like theyalready pivoting their answer sort ofrecognizing what we want to hear that'stotally fine with me like if theyrecognize ownership is sort of a keyleadership principle and they sort ofswitch their answers to demonstrate moreownership great like that's sort of whatyou want is uh people who and changetheir mind over time. Awesome. So onceyou you get hired and and you start ininside of Amazon back in your day, whatwas the the kind of tooling stack? And Iknow it's changing these days becauseI'm hearing more and more of it. It'spretty much AWS which is which is superunique across all of the companies bythe way like you know Google doesn't useGCP internally and Microsoft is startingto use Azure a little bit but not nearlyas much and you know Meta has their ownyou know thing. Uh so yeah, I would sayit changed it was changing over time andit dep it was actually one of theinteresting things you know like I wasmentioning before of people would saylike you're totally wrong like no oneused that. Um there were homegrown likeuh web hosting stuff that we used in ummarketplace back in the which was likeoriginally was Groupa and then wasmultiple versions of of new web hostingplatforms that that teams were buildingon. And you get over to AWS and they'relike well obviously everyone's using allAWS systems now to build things. And Ithought it was sort of funny becauseit's like obviously we're all using thisand like a lot of teams weren't yet. Umthen you move over to uh IDOs anddevices and like the mobile stacks andthat was pretty much using straight uplike the the development tools that needto be used, you know, by Apple and by umuh Google in terms of like the Androiddevelopment system and stuff. And so itit was highly dependent on what stackyou're building on. Is it like ahomegrown web hosting platform or are webuilding, you know, AWS tools or are webuilding devices? Andum and that's one of the reasons likewhen we talk about like a job I didn'tmention of the bar racers is alsoum for example I I've seen peoplecomplain that a candidate only coded inPython for their answers like anddefinitely a bar raiser answer for thatis we don't care what language they codein because we every time you change jobsyou're frequently going to use differenttools. like it's just there's just sucha wide selection of tools and againthere's some homegrown some AWS and youwant people to pivot to different toolsyou want them to be able to say sureI'll flip to Cotlin or something forcoding because why not this team does itum or or you know this software stackwe've decided to switch and you wantthem for the most part we want engineersto be funible to be able to switch overand you know you move over to um we hadsome like not C++ but C code inside ofone of the AWS teams I was on, forexample. And which as a side note wassort of funny because I think I knewmore C than a lot of the engineersbecause I'm old enough to like that'swhat I was learning in college. Oh yeah.And so I remember them saying somethingabout like stupid memory management andI'm like wait C like cool let me Ihaven't looked at the code in a while.That's not a SDM thing at Amazon. Um butI'm going to look at this like I'm sortof curious because um like you'resuddenly flipping back into mywheelhouse now that you're looking atreally old code. One thing I've kind ofheard a few horror stories about Amazonis on call and how brutal uh it can be.Like what is on call like? Uh how is itorganized? How important is it? And Ithink we all know or most of us willknow about Amazon's customer obsession.How does that translate onto on call?Yeah, I I think it's a super interestingand also I would say one of the moreinteresting differences between likeFacebook and Amazon. Um, so at least inthe teams I was on at Meta, like there'sno emergency support. It's, you know,there's a completely separate team thatwas dealing with emergencies. I thinkthat's true of Google as well. Um, atAmazon, it was like it's a core aspectof most teams way that they operate isif you wrote the code, you're alsosupporting it in production. And notjust like when we talk about supporting,we're talking about literally you're theone deciding which fleets host your codeand which data centers and howdistributed do you need to be and howare you sharding your database and allthis kind of stuff. It's very, you know,the ownership stack is is or theownership leadership principle comesinto play on a lot of this stuff. Butthat also means that your team in mostcases sets up a rotation where there'ssomeone responding to emergencies inreal time when emergencies happen.And the the philosophy behind it is ifthere's problems with your software, youwant the problems to land on the personpeople who know it best. And the pain ofbad software lands on the people whohave the responsibility to fix it. Andso there's this when done well, andthere's a couple caveats there. Whendone well, I really appreciate it. Likeas a manager of a team, I've been pagedin way too many times at 1 or 2 a.m.because there was a problem. Butalso I believe that managed like youknow you go into work 2 days later aftera couple big emergency nights and we sayokay we're stopping all featuredevelopments and we're fixing theseproblems. Right? That's that's like thethe done well part is it's we are notpatching this. We are not setting it toreboot every night to to fix it. We'renot letting people get paged at 2 a.m.because that'sridiculous. So we're going to fix itright now. We're going to rewrite thiscode. Whatever. Um, I would say likecontrast in the negative way. There weresome systems that Facebook I rememberpeople talking about like, \"Oh, they'vebeen having problems for months.\" Likethey're just restarting this thingconstantly. Some point in time we'll getsomeone to fix it. And I was like,\"That's interesting because at least theteams I ran, we would have fixed thatthing right away because it would likeyou would lose your mind if your systemwas always having errors like this.\" Um,on the other side, like the the poorlyrun teams where you hear like it's beennine months now and everyone is pagedtwo or three times a night. Anytimethey're on rotation, they never sleepbecause they're getting paged everysingle night. That's just a nightmare.Like that's just not okay. Things arebroken there. Like that's that's amanagement problem. Um, I think morethan anything. So yeah, so the rotationsusually on most teams, let's say youhave a team of like seven people,seven's a good maybe eight. uh eightpeople. You usually have someone go onrotation for a week. And for that week,you're responsible for responding toemergencies. On most of my teams, thatwould be, let's just say like two timesin that week, you would be pagedsometime off hours. A lot of times it's9:00 p.m. Uh frequently it's when codegets pushed. So if you are pushing yourcode at 10 p.m., which is a commonenough time of like, hey, we have adowntime in traffic. Let's push the codeand make sure it works. The pager goesoff.Um, it's not a big deal. I think whenyou have a team having issues and you'regetting paid two or three times everynight, that's just a nightmare. Um, butagain, most of the time that was fixedpretty quickly. Like the engineersaren't okay with it. Hopefully themanager is not okay with it and then umyou get it resolved. Yeah. Well, I Ithink there's always a there's always adownside of being too close to theproblems, right? Because totally you dohave to be responsive. But if it's setup in a way that you're actually pagedfor things that truly matter and matterto like let's say customers, you'reyou're now going to fix it faster. I Ithink you know we've all used softwarewhere like there were some annoying bugsand you can tell when it's there likemonths later that that is not paginganyone inside of they might not evenknow about it or people with and I thinkit's like can you tie responsibility foryour schedule like in terms of like whatare you working on next? tie that to theresponsibility of responding to problemsand tie that to the responsibility ofhaving a good customer obsession andthat's where it's done well right um asI I sometimes have to remind people overand over again like I'd hear from anengineer like oh yeah that was such ahard on call last week and I wasn'tpaying attention as a manager orsomething or maybe I'm the seniormanagerum and I'd be like what what do you meanlike last week and I have to go likequickly run a report because uh usuallymanager is not paged into everythingunless it escalates like if they can'tfix it within 10 minutes, then I getpaged or something. Um, and they say,\"Oh, yeah, we got paged eight times lastweek.\" And I'm like, \"Well, what youknow, what did you have to fix?\" Theysay, \"Oh, we haven't had a chance to fixit yet.\" And you're like, \"Oh my god.\"Like, dude, why are we working onanything else if you're getting paidseven times in a week? Like, that's notokay. Um, so I usually would say likeyou should only be okay with being on anon call rotation if you also have thecapability of of saying that this is thenext most important thing we're allgoing to work on.So I think it's not fair when you putresponsibility on people if you don'tgive them the authority to to alsoredirect your resources. You know, thosethings have to come together. And so umI would say most teams at Amazon hadthat. I would and certainly there wereteams where they felt like were helplessand just had a terrible time of it. Umbut well-run teams you would say likethey're not going to be okay with againa a bad operational situation. And thenwhen outages happen, what is thecategorization? I I think there'sdifferent levels between the severity ofof the outage, right? So like a pagecomes in, someone decides the on calldecides that it's if it's an outage andthen they have to assign a level to it.How does that work? Yeah, it and it wasdifferent across teams a little bit oflike what the exact severity meant againbecause Amazon hates consistency in allways and for the most part. I love thelack of consistency because you can justinvent things and just tell. One of myfavorite things as a side note was uhsomeone would say like, you know, thatthey're doing something and I don't likeit, right? And I would say I wouldquickly go edit our wiki and and writein a rule against whatever they just didand then say like as you can see here inthis document, that's not allowed. Andthen they would look at the wiki andsay, \"Well, that's true.\" Okay. And I'mlike, I was never called on to the factthat I just edited like the rule set orthe, you know, instructions or thestep-by-step whatever that I just likeedited and then showed them the theinstructions. It was great how peoplewould just believe these things. Um,that was like a barra razor thing, too.It's like that's not allowed. And I amthe bar raiser, so I would know thesethings. They're like, \"Oh, okay. Cool.Smart hack.\" Oh, man. Yeah. Withconfidence, you can get past almosteverything if you need to. Uh, but yeah.So, um, most of the time in most teamsthere's severity one through five. Andfive means we're never going to do fixanything because it's not doesn'tdoesn't matter at all. Most things arelike level three, which is um it's aproblem. You should work on it someday.Uh severity two is severity two and oneare the ones that would like pagepeople, make people pay attention, maketheir phones freak out. Um severity 2and one are just emergencies. And forthe most part, severity 2 is what we'reused for most things. Severity one islike companywide emergency is sort of umuh you know, sev one. It's a it's wasusually like the phrasing for it. um incertain groups like uh let's say AWS inin SEV 2 is there's a system problem andwe need to fix it and you'll probablylet your manager know SE one is usuallylike this is where I um so for a while Iwas on the encroation of manager you getpaged in instantly for SE ones it waslike you would have a big less you couldset up a you know a distribution listwhere a whole bunch of people would getalerted for your SE one including maybeyour VP maybe your SVP um for for AWSstyle SE ones that was frequently like Iwas writing to Jasse right away with alist of other SVPs and VPs on the listsaying we have an AWS outage like blahblah blah. So I actually have a reallyinteresting story and one of the reasonsI I asked this we had a senior directorjoin from Amazon. He was a seniordirector there and he became the seniordirector of my of my group. Amazondoesn't have senior directors. That'sthat level nine thing that doesn'texist. Okay. Well, I'm not maybe adirector. Anyway, people like to inventtheir own titles or or or maybe it was adirector who became a senior director,but he was senior director, which meantthat he had about like 300 engineers inhis group and we we had an outage. So,my team was payments and the way Uberdid it. So, Amazon SE1 was L5 like firstL1 was the smallest and L3 is internal.L4 is like, you know, it's just theopposite. So, L5 is the highest out isis when it's actually companywide. So itimpacts the whole product. We'reactually losing revenue or somethinglike that. And then there's like levelsthere's like low, high, medium or high.And my team pretty frequently had an L5low outage which meant that paymentswere down in one part of the world.Typically we had a third party issue.Let's say um one of the payment methodsin India just stopped working becausethe thing had an outage there. And it itwas pretty routine for us. like this issomething that we couldn't do anythingabout beyond alert the uh you know thethird party and so we were just havingone of these things and we always have acall it's kind of routine likeeveryone's just sitting there boredsaying okay have you guys page the thirdparty yeah we page suddenly my the thisnew director is in the call saying allright what's the situation can I helpanyone here and I'm like it's like Jeffwhat are you doing here he's like it'sit's a this is this is L5 right it's thehighest one right like it'sI was like, \"Yeah, it is.\" He's like,\"Okay, I'm here. Use me. How can put outthe fire?\" So then I learned that on atAmazon VPs jump onto SE one. And we werejust having really casual like for uslike an off five wasn't really likethis. We just knew this was just ourregular Ali because we had to follow wewe couldn't do anything about it. But itjust made me realize how Amazon's takingit way more seriously. And this thissenior like jumped out of some importantmeeting to go there and for me it wasjust like whoa. like this is this is newfor me. Yeah. So it it just shows I itgave me a sense of how serious Amazonseems and I have not seen any othercompanies or have not heard any othercompanies where the the the largestoutages are taken so seriously by byeveryone the whole man the wholeleadership chain. So I think that's youknow just it's a bit of a story there.Operational excellence and dives deepand all these kind of things tie intogether. So, and and there's thisculture which you know sometimes peoplecomplain about like new external hires.Sometimes Amazon has had these pocketsof like uh you know a bunch of VPs hiredfrom a different company where wherethey they don't join the on call youknow don't join this F1 and it's likethis like oh my god like these these badexternal people who don't understand howwe do things. Um, but I would say yeah,the longtime Amazonians like we wouldsometimes have for example in AWS you'dhave the engineers call where they'reall discussing fixes and then sort ofseparately like there's also the VP SVPcall of like give us the updates what'sthe current status because and some ofthis is a scale thing right like Netflixis down like we're sitting there andlike Netflix is down in like half thecountry because there's some globalnetworking outage and we're like tryingto also Amazon scale you know we'rewe're talking to the backbone providerstrying to get them to fix things faster.We're telling them exactly where thebackbone broke because our alerts aremuch better than theirs. Like there Iwas shocked sometimes at like uh um theconnections that you have and the datayou have sometimes are somind-bogglingly big. You know, it's likeyou you see the news articles coming outand it's like like we know about thebackbone outage in whatever placebecause we can see exactly where it isin the network based on all of ouralerts and alarms and all that kind ofstuff. But yeah, it was very expectedthat depending on the scale of youroutage or issue going on that your VPwould be joining in the call if not notusually to run it unless it's reallyimportant but definitely like umwhat you want and which is what youusually have is we need X done and youneed it done right now. And that's thekind of thing a VP or director, whoever,you know, whoever the really seniorperson is is around for is um like, oh,okay, you need, you know, we need a thekind of thing that would come upsometimes is like, oh my god, we need100 extra servers right now. You know,these big beefy things. We need themprovisioned immediately in Dublin. Andthey say, okay, we're, you know, I'm I'mcalling that, you know, the head of EC2right now on the phone and we're goingto get that, you know, some engineer toallocate those to us in the next abouttwo minutes. And so boom boom boom theyget this thing done and a bunch ofservers are turning on umbecause the person can do the directcall and just say I need this right nowand they say got it. So I think thatthat's useful. I mean it it sounds to meif you you know like this might sound abit like cheeky but if if you get it toAmazon and usually being on an outageyou don't really want to be on an outageas an engineer but if you're in one ofthese outages and it already happenedit's kind of an awesome opportunity.Where else would you be able to evenexperience this? I have heard from I Ibelieve like if you're talking aboutlike um building skills in terms of likerunning running software, not like justwriting software, but like runningsoftware, right? If you want to go to astartup and run software, um you hirelike if you get an Amazon engineer who'sbeen in the thick of things sometimes,it's like you're not just good atwriting software, but you've seen whathappened. like Twilio calls you know Igot on the phone with you know the CTOofTwilio company you know it's like we'rehaving this issue it's in this specificregion and we're like we have engineersin the room you know we're talking tothem on the phone in a separate phonecall from the engineers talking aboutwhatever test they're running onwhatever trace routes and figuringthings out and like the skills you buildin terms of product and what can we askthe customer to do can we ask them totest something can we get access totheir host so we can try something outum it's it's such a cool experience Ithink it sucks that it's happening at 3a.m. sometimes, but I would say most ofthe time it's not because it usuallyproblems happen when you pushcode. Just the way things work. Uh uhfunny thing of like the amount of pagesthat happen when Amazon historically didlock down sometime around Thanksgivingtime. You would just stop pushing codechanges out in this exponential drop offin pages because changes are what breaksthings in the world. Um, but yeah, Ithink the experience I think you youtalk two years later about like, oh, wehad such a good time on the teamtogether, didn't we? You always talkabout the outages and stuff because thatwas the exciting times at work. Yeah.Yeah. One interesting thing about Amazonthat's that's also just Amazon wasfamous for and people get surprised foris the frugality. Yeah. Can can you tellme what you know what what engineersexperience or what did engineerscomplain to you who joined from likecompanies that were a bit more generous?You know, like I I worked at Uber. Ivisited friends at Google Meta. You havelike these like, you know, just kind ofstandard perks like like lunch uh at atI think at Uber we had like thesevending machines. You could you couldget like whatever like mice free stufffrom the vending machines. Yeah. Yeah.Our vending machines hardware,you know, they got a profit from ourvending machines. It wasn't even likecost. Oh my god. Yeah. Um Yeah. No, no.Uh I thinkAmazon and there's there is someinteresting points that um sometimeswe've had these arguments of like oh mygod like the amount of money that youpay engineers why can't you be a littlebit more generous and some of it comesdown to fridity like the stupid frugalthing. Um this is like just thisridiculous stupid level of frugality. Umbut sometimes they do there isinteresting explanations. Um becauseAmazon has fulfillment centers and wehave the majority of Amazon's workersare very very low margin per person uhyou can't afford to and then they talkabout for I think legal and otherreasons that they can't offer differentbenefits and different things perks tocorporate workers versus fulfillmentworkers whether or not that's legalwhether or not that's just like nowwe're at risk for unions forming acrossthe world because they're giving unfairbenefits to corporate workers. Um youlook at something like uh 401k match forexample was something that you know cameup was like couldn't we just do a youknow double the match do a you know 100%of whatever and like yeah we could forengineers but we definitely can't affordthat for FC workers because our marginthere is like0.5%. If we give them any more moneywe're losing money on every item Amazonsells. Like we have to be very verycareful. It's super expensive to havemillion workers. I mean for good reasonlike it's just expensive. So, uh, whenyou try to give, you know, try to givecomparable benefits to corporate workersand you have these issues. Um, but thenyou get to just how Amazon operates isunless there's a really damn good reasonto spend the money, we don't do it. Andthat's the same thing for resources. Ithink if you had tochoose, I guess as a business owner, aperson who wants a company to besuccessful, you would definitely wantyour company to be frugal. Like that theamount of money wasted when I was atFacebook, it just blew my mind. I mean,just some things are great. It's veryrelaxing to get free food. It's very andno big deal. Like, in comparison to theamount you're paid, like you calculateit out and it's like, okay, what youknow, a few thousand dollar a year spentper person on food compared to theirsalary is nothing, so why not do it? Um,but then you get to just like the stupidlevels of waste of like buildingproducts that no one needs or somethinglike that. And at Amazon, I kept belike, \"Oh my god, we would never Iremember saying once like, \"This projectlooks like a duplicate of this otherproject. Shouldn't we shut it down?\"When I was at Facebook, shouldn't weshut it down? And they looked at me likeI was crazy and like, \"Why would we shutit down?\" I'm like, \"Well, cuz we'rewasting money.\" And they're like, \"So wehave billions. Like what? What?\" Like itwas just kind of like confusion overlike, \"Why would we not build somethingpointlessly just for fun?\"And very deep in Amazon's culture isthis like we do things efficiently. Nowsometime sometimes you're doing thingsefficiently to launch something faster.So you'll rewrite someone's code becauseit's faster than integrating with theirsor something like you know you're you'realways balancing speed of buildingversus efficiency of resources and allthat kind of stuff. But I thinkum if your if your answer is alwaysunless there's a strong reason to do it,let's not do it leads to like at leastthe first half of my tenure at Amazonengineers would get like one monitor ofonly 16 in or something ridiculous. Andum like literally and it was I mean itwas both hilarious but also frustratingwas like an intern would leave andbefore the IT group came up to taketheir equipment it was like the sharkswould swim in all the engineers wouldrun over and take their equipment, taketheir extra keyboard, take their monitorand stuff because they wanted twomonitors and the only way to get it isto steal someone else's.That was stupidity but oh my god it wasso stupid. But I think it is goodcontext like just understanding wherethe company is coming from and that itis a unique set up in the sense thatthere are so many fulfillment centerworkers which most companies do not haveand and they don't have this. Soyeah, and and fix things. I mean, datadriven. I've been on teams where theywrote six pager explaining why theyneeded, you know, the top-of-the-lineMac Pros instead of the middlegrade MacPros and they explained the, you know,productivity benefits and someone said,\"Okay, now now you've explained it.\"Like finally someone came up with anactual math reason, not just like wewould like it and boom, everyone gottheir stuff and we moved on. Butum I would say like if you had to choosebetween frugality and not frugality,you'd want frugality. It just makesthings operate better when you spendmoney on the things that need to bespent on and not waste time uhelsewhere. Um, but it definitely can befrustrating.

Now,one thing when I did my Amazon deep diveon on Amazon's engineering culture, onekind of one of the most negative thingsthat came up was Amazon's so-called URtarget, unregulated attrition target,which if rumors have it that every yearabout 6% of staff is expected to leaveas unregulated attrition and what thisresults in is basically uh focus plans,which which is what comes before PIP andand there's pips and and the people Iagain I have friends at Amazon and manyof them mentioned that either they wereon a PIP or they had a someone else bebe on a PIP. There there is a bit of ayou know scare uncertainty especiallyfor for people entering Amazon. You wereon the other side of this. You were amanager plus you clearly you were alsolike maybe sub subject to this on yourend. How scary is this and how does itplay out in in reality? I would say formost people it wasn't scary and it likeso you know at various times it wasbetween six to 10% of people had to beit and exact exactly what's measured wasa little different over time of likewhether or not you were like 6 to 10%had to be rated poorly or 6 to 10% hadto be put into like coaching or whateveror 6 to 10% had to be fired. umsometimes different levels of goals interms of like the cascading level oflike as you're managing people outthere's goals to hit.Um but I wouldsay it wasn't scary for the vastmajority of people because you'relooking ahead. You're thinking about howdo I get promoted? How do I, you know,do these projects well so I can getahead in my career. I don't think you'reI don't think most people are thinkingI'm probably in the bottom 10% of all mypeers, right?I think most people don't think thatyou're not worried about being thebottom 10%. And I would say until itpops up, right? You move to a new team,your manager doesn't like you, and youthink about like, huh, my managerdoesn't like me and seems to like all mypeers. Suddenly, it becomes very scarybecause I I've actually heard this frompeople I know of the same story that Ithey've been with Amazon for some time,great, either a new manager came or theymoved to a new team and that's whenthings became, you know, I actually hada friend who was put on a pip. Hethought it was really unfair. He wasthere for 4 years. He actually made itout of it, but he he kind of becamebitter, especially if she was hismanager. Almost never happens. Yeah.Yeah. Uh he he actually turned itaround, but yeah. Still, yeah, I thinkthere's a few a few edge cases wherepeople can make it out of pips. Andmostly that I would say the vastmajority of people who get out of thoseis something like a collegehire. And you know, this is just acommon thing. I I make fun of collegehires because of like how much they movefrom kids to adult over time, right?Like you're you're in college and you'rea kid and then you become an adult. howmany times they get hired and likethey're three months into their job andI see them posting on Instagram at 4 inthe morning and then the next day theydon't show up to work and they're like,\"I was sick.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I bet youwere sick.\" Like alcohol poisoning isdefinitely an illness.Um, like that's kids, right? Like it'slike, \"Dude, you haven't done any workin two weeks and you're out late and youshow up to work at 1 p.m. Like then thenyou can get a pit that you can get outof because they decide to buckle downand actually do their work. Yep. you letthem back out because you think they'recompetent. They're just need to grow up.Um, but if you think about like the theincentives, right? You're you're runningateam. I have 50 people working for me.Uh, because usually like the thecriteria of that like six to 10% is onlyif you're in a big enough or work. So,let's say I have 50 people. So, now thecriteria hits me because usually it's 50or or so when you start to have theseexpectations. Um, if I need to rate 10%of my team poorly, let's say, and I have50 people, that means I need to findfive people by the time the reviewperiod rolls around. I need to be likeconsidering who's not doing great. Um,review period is every six months, every12 months. 12 months. Yeah. 12 months.Yeah. Yeah. And it again like at varioustimes we had checkpoints, six monthcheckpoints. Sometimes HR would carethat you're flagging people. Sometimesit's like a aum for the most part, especially whenyou're talking about like firing people,it would be like by the end of the year,you need to have fired 65 people. Andsometimes it's like, well, we alreadydid four along the year because ofvarious things that happened. So thefifth one is the only one we're lookingfor. And so you're going through thereview period with your 50 people andyou need to find one person. It's not abig deal, right? You talk to that wouldprobably be like seven or eight managersat least. one of them has some employeewho's not doing great or one of yourmanagers is annoying as hell and so youlike no you're okay. Um but uh um Iwould say it it becomes an issue whenyour team especially if your team ismore stable like if you're constantlyhiring people like there's always goingto be new blood someone wasn'tinterviewed well someone's just like notat all suited to be here and that makesit easy. when your team's more stableand you've been for the most part withthe same people for two years and you'rerunning into yet another review cycleand you're like, \"Oh my god, like wealready got rid of everyone who was notdoing great. Everyone on my team isdoing well.\" Now you end up infrustrating situations. Um, and it mostof the time I would say it was it wasnot a big deal and wasn't that stressfulbecause uh it again those thoseexpectations don't come into play untilyou have a bigger organization. So likeyou're a dev manager and you'd say no,everyone on my team's good and as longas you have backbone, you're okay withthat. And then you get to be a seniormanager and you have 47people. The criteria doesn't apply toyou still. Now you start to have like,you know, boy, you have 47 people, youhave no one underperforming. Are yousure? Like 47 people. Like now you startto get to the point where your managersits down with you and says, let's gothrough and tell me the bottom fivepeople of your or why they don't deserveto be rated as least effective. Um, andthen you get to bigger orgs and that'swhere you get this weird like theorganizational pressure of like now youhit your director. You know, I have 150people reporting to me. I need to comeup with the I don't know 11 people whoare in coaching by the end of the yearor something. And like now I sit downwith my managers and say, \"Okay guys,like we have eight. I need11.\" Like sorry, we we have to talkthrough all the people who are like onthat borderline and explain why they'renot whatever at this level. um becausefor the most part they they were veryvery hard asses on making sure that youhit these um the the goals. And thenfrom a software engineer perspective,you know, you're kind of like blissfullyunaware. You're kind of working away.Let's imagine that you know like one dayyour manager probably had this likediscussion with their director or youknow their manager and they identifiedyou as as someone.Usually when when this happens you knowlike you kind of in in your group youcircle down on like all right this isthis person these are the people who areunderperforming. Yep. Is is there also apartwhere there is like reasoning given ofwhy so that the manager can go back andsay like all right here's here's thedifference here's why you're not meetingexpectations or is it just more likewell you know you're you're b you'rebottom of the pile like sorry here's apip.So, so I guess the first thing to say islike there there's oftena definition issue and even even withthe managers sometimes like boy this iswhere managers screw up the most oftenand you almost need like a bar razor forHR processes.Um the description of that lowest ratingand the description of letting people gois all about not not meetingexpectations. It is least effective. Andso the argument is we explain to peopleis if we have a hundred people we wantlet's just let's just you know pick aneasy number you know the bottom 5% fivepeople out of that hundred we want theleast effective of them it doesn't meannot effective it doesn't mean thatthey're not doing their job but if youpick the bottom five people and saywould you rather keep them or would yourather interview and find someone whomight be just this amazing awesome hireand most of the time you would say wellI mean the bottom five out of a 100people aren't great. Like they might beokay at their job comparatively, right?Comparatively, like they're they're afine, let's just say, engineer, right?They're they're a fine engineer. Mostpeople get that work done in a week andit takes them two weeks because they'reslower. Like it's just like they're notgreat. If their manager is doing well,their manager has been telling them thisall along is like, \"Hey, do you noticethat your work is getting done slowerthan everyone else on the team?\" Right?Because again, this is the bottom fiveof a hundred. Like they're slower thaneveryone else. they're making moremistakes, like whatever it is that makesthem at the bottom. Hopefully, they'vebeen getting feedback along the way. Andthen in this discussion that inevitablyhappened, right, you have all themanagers in a room with their seniormanager, maybe with the director, andyou're having detailed discussions. Andwe're saying, \"Okay, their productivityis lower. They make a lot of mistakes.their peers complain a lot about thembecause almost always there's like a lotof peer like I really don't want to workwith Dave on this one because boy Davealways is slower and you have to do mostof the work for Dave right so you havethis collaborative discussion withwhatever feedback you have available tosay okay definitely Dave has to be inthat bottomfive now hopefully again the manager ofDave has been giving him feedbackthroughout the year and and maybe thishappens not at the very end of the yearlike preferably it's not just like allof a sudden wham everyone getssurprised. Um but if it has happenedthen yes you you the manager should beable to sit down and say you are beingrated as least effective or you're beingput into coaching or whatever you knowwhatever it is the step is becausehere's the the you know the situationyou know you in the last foursprints you know specifically in thelast four sprints you have missed youryou know your uh projects haven't beencompleted like we thought would becompleted in the sprint every singlesprint for the last four sprints we'vealready talked about this Um the issueusually comes up is if the manager hasbeen saying you're awesome, you'reawesome, you're awesome, and thensuddenly like terribly sorry, you're incoaching now because you're not awesome.And that I've actually heard quite a bitthat the problem that some some of thepeople that I talked with who were inthe situation, their manager was new ordid not understand and some of thosethings. But this this does make sense.In some ways, it feels to me, correct meif I'm wrong, but this feels somewhatsimilar to Netflix in the sense of, youknow, Netflix is also very open abouthaving the keeper test where they reregular re-evaluate people. And they'renot saying you're not meetingexpectations. They're just like, well,if if someone is not, they actually dothe other way around. They're saying ifsomeone is not worth fighting forkeeping, y we we don't necessarily wantto retain them. In fact, we might letthem go. And they're they communicatethis up front. Whereas with Amazon, if Iunderstand, they're saying you're theleast effective, which again, people gotinto Amazon, it's it's it's hard to getinto. They're typically good engineers.They might they might be awesome at alot of places, but Amazon says, \"Okay,let's you know, we we want to this isthis is their performance philosophy.\"Yeah. Yeah. And I think a good number ofthe times if you talk to someone and saylike you know someone who's getting thiskind of feedback and they're saying butI did complete that eventually orsomething like that and say but do youagree that every person on the teamwould have gotten that done faster thanyou? Like you know it's well yes. islike okay so at least you would agreeout of your 11 peers on the team thatyou are the slowest engineer like youknow it's like I think people understandone of the hard things is just like thedifference between least effective whichis just like hey at the bottom of thepile you're all you're going to be atrisk if you if you think if you lookaround the room and you're thinking yepI'm the worst one here that's not agreat situation to ever be in um it'sjust never safe and at Amazon it'sdefinitely not safe at some othercompanies where they just might you knowdo layoffs once every four years youmight be safe for quite a while butAmazon has this sort of regular cycleyou know well also I feel some companiesand I I wrote about this I I I feel Isense some companies are are starting tobecome a bit more like Amazon soFacebook has done 5% performance basedlayoff for uh this time I think Stripewas doing something similar sopreviously I I think we saw there wasthese kind of golden years if you willyou know when the job market was reallygood Amazon kept doing this and andAmazon was really the kind of the badcompany if you will the only one whowere doing besides Netflix. Yeah. And itseems to me Amazon hasn't changedanything, but some of the othercompanies are doing so. Maybe assoftware engineers, we should acceptthat, you know, like some of these topcompanies in terms of brandcompensation, Yeah. they're they'regoing to be tougher places to to be atand and, you know, they'll just keeppushing people to to to do better andthey'll keep comparing people with oneanother. Yeah. And in in terms of likeas an individual if you're joining as anengineer or or manager, you know, anyoneum I think one of the things to keep inmind in terms of like ego and like howdoes it feel to be told all of a suddenlike you're not doing well.Um I guess partially is like awarenessof I would actually say as a managereven like 50% of that performancefrequently is your relationship withyour manager and like your team how wellyou fit in with the team with your peerswith your manager. So many times I'vehad someone who was either doing amazingon one team, they move to the next teamand they're like actually not doing wellat all or someone who was not doing wellescapes to another team before they getfired and they do well. Like they, youknow, I've had people who I was planningon firing who managed to transfer off myteam in time and they ended up gettingpromoted someday. And the same thing,I've had people who said like, \"I'mabout to befired. Uh, I'm pretty sure that it'scoming towards me. Can I get off theThis is like my my sneaky recommendationfor anyone is like if you start to hearperformance feedback whatsoever fromyour management chain. If you have anyopportunity at all, get off your teamfast as possible. Like that's that's theuh as we frequently say it's like unfairthing that managers know is if yourmanager says, you know, that wasn't sogreat what you did recently. And he'slike, \"Okay, well, switching teams likefast as I can.\" Because uh um mostmanagers won't. Now, if you trust yourmanager, they might be actually justgiving you honest feedback, which you'dlike to be able to receive. But for themost part, if you've been working forsomeone for 3 years and suddenly theystart giving you performance feedback,that's a really bad sign. Um if you runfor the hills fast enough, it's possibleyou'll get away before they flag you inthe system as is non-transferable. Yeah.Yeah, and I guess it's just worthkeeping in mind that for you people whohave not worked that these are companiesinternal transfers are possible and youdo want to make take advantage of whenwhen it makes sense. It's still betterto do or easier to do internal transferthan to start a new job search processto start you know like your network willif you change companies you'll have tostart to rebuild your network and so on.Yeah. I and I think again it frequentlyis not that you're a bad manager or abad software engineer, a bad projectmanager or something. It's just, youknow, sometimes it doesn't work out withyou and your manager. And I think thesame thing like if you're like, \"Boy, Idon't get along well with my manager,but I like this team.\" Like that'sthat's not the safest thing to to to putup with. I've heard people saying thatlike, \"My manager doesn't like me, but Ireally like what we're working on.\" I'mlike, \"Dude, get off the team.\" Like ifyou want to keep your job, get off theteam. I feel Amazon might might mightmake some of these kind of you knowuniversal truths a bit like moreemphasized because I remember like forexample I I worked at Microsoft at atime where Microsoft just didn't letpeople go and there were people who werewho were doing really bad like like weknew like they were doing bad work butfor some reason management didn't wantto let anyone go so they were deadweight but if and and by the way whenyou know like actually when this policyI wasn't there when it changed But Iheard heard when I changed they were oneof the first ones to let go and no onewas surprised. But the point is likeit's this is usually how companies workin like either normal times or when whentimes are a bit tougher. Right now it isa bit tougher and it's just good toprepare for that. So like speaking formyself I was always paranoid and in mostmost of my companies especially when Ijoined the first like six to 12 monthsof I assumed I probably was not doingthat good. So I tried to do my best andyou know hope that it was enough. overtime you could become more comfortable.But as you said, I was as a manager aswell, if you're not getting with yourmanager, what you said, like like youneed to switch managers, like try to fixit if you can, but if you can't,sometimes there's just not much you cando. Yeah. I thinkthat there's like the the mistake thatpeople will sometimes make is like mymanager doesn't influence my job thatmuch because I can work independentlyor, you know, I don't need to figurethis out with my manager because I can,you know, work with my peers or I havethis great engineer on my team. I canwork with. Um, but especially at a placelike Amazon, like your manager isresponsible for your rating, which islike tied directly into comp. Likethey're definitely responsible for yourpromotion. Like you're never ever goingto get promoted if your manager doesn'tlike you. And uh, every year at least,your manager needs to pick out a numberof people who are not doing great. Andso if you're not getting along with yourmanager, you need to fix it or you needto move on to another team. Like that'sjust a a a solid thing at Amazon. andand and there are bad managers. I thinklike half the time someone gets fired,it's probably because the manager islike, you know, it's a relationshipissue. And I guess it's it's fair to saythe this is specific to Amazon and maybeat some other companies you can get by.But I think it's fair to say the otherthing as well, right? If you have agreat manager, someone where you reallyclick, they have your back, you've gotyour back, you work well together, y itmight be even worth follow, you know,like depending on the situation. Butoften times I hear people followingtheir managers to other companies, youknow, they join a year later, they reachout, do you want to have a coffee? Guesswhat? They're going to be their theirright hand at that company as well. Iactually know people who have risen withand you know these good managers usuallyOh yeah, not always but but often timesthey're good at you know get gettingahead especially because they they dobring some of their team. So if if youknow or if you have a good manager or ifyou had in the past just hit them upagain. Uh it it's rare like it's notthat easy. Oh, totally that if you ifyou've had no managers with that youhave a good good enough relationshipwhere you want to go move with them thenyou've either had really unfortunatechoice of managers or maybe you'rehaving the issue with the therelationship you know sometimes it's younot them but uh yeah know I've heardbefore from managers especially as youget higher level is like if they don'tpull in a number of people into their orsoon as they transfer over and likethere's not a list of people ready totransfer over then maybe there's anissue with that person because you wantthem to say how like every time I movedgroups I would frequently start off withhow many open roles am I going to havebecause I have a number of people who Iwant you know who will be happy to comeover and join and take all those openpositions um and that's what you expectthat's what you you should have andespecially within Amazon that's atotally expected thing is um the personcomes over and then suddenly like allthe spots fill up with the people whohave followed them for the last three oryou know org moves and that's just yeahand it's a good way to shuffle um Ithink it's healthy especially you atcompanies like Amazon where you wantfresh blood and new ideas, new thoughtslike it's a good way of you know orgssort of shuffle around you know your VPleaves and suddenly half your managementteam leaves like that's a good thingthat means the VP was liked by somepeople they move off to somewhere elseto bring some new ideas in and then youget a whole fresh swath of of new hiresso I'm getting a sense that Amazon andobviously I got that sense when I wasrefreshing Amazon but talking to youeven more so that Amazon is just not nota typical what you would expect a largecompany to be. And one thing I'venoticed that I think underscores this iswhen startups hire from large techcompanies. When I'm talking withfounders or people who have hired in thepast or engineers who work with them,there's a lot of eye rolling like gh wehired that person from Google and itdidn't really work out at a smallcompany or or meta or some othercompanies. One thing that I rarely hearis that this Amazon hire didn't workout. In fact, I see so many Amazonpeople go to, you know, either largetech companies and then they like somethat even have like maybe a shinierbrand like Google, Meta, OpenAI, etc.,and they do pretty well there, but theyalso go to startups and they do prettywell there as as employees, not just asfounders. Why do you think this is Imean, I think we've already touched on afew things why it could be becauseAmazon feels a bit like a scrappystartup even though it's a big company.I mean, corporatewide is not a scrappystartup. It's a big old behemoth thatcan't turn, you know, to save its life.Uh, so,not that I'm biased or anything, butsometimes like HR policies and stufflike, you know, with a few Amazonwidethings, it's like good luck freakingchanging anything. It's like bang myhead against the wall so many timestrying to get things changed.Um, so corporatewide they're not, butwhen you get down to a dev team, like II loved the fact of like almosteverything is controllable at the lowestpossible level. And so, um, you know,everything from stupid changes peoplecan make or awesome changes they canmake that you have a lot of control atevery individual dev team can pick theirprocess, can pick their coding language,can pick how they're deploying theircode, like what tools they're going touse. And sometimes it becomes stupidlike it's just like what the there was ateam that built their whole um veryimportant middleware like service out oflisp and it's like what are theythinking like it's why I mean is surebut no one else knows the damn languagelike no one else has written anything inLisbon like no one knows what you'redoing. Um, and I think it was like twoengineers on the team had this greatidea and they wrote the whole damnservice and like great, they built theservice and they all transferred off theteam and then they had to rewrite thecode because no one knew how to supportit and it was this nightmare. But theycould, right? And thankfully no one cameup with an Amazonwide policy sayingyou're not allowed to write anythingexcept if it's in Java or something. Um,so teams would regularly build stuff inwhatever language they want, in whatevertool set they want, at whatever pacethey want. They can do agile, they cando waterfall, they can do scrum or umthey can not do sprints, they can Iliked the fact that unless there's astrong strong strong reason forsomething to be dictated by Amazon or VPor director whatever else for the mostpart the culturewas you can't tell me what to do like ina good way as in like um you know thedirector would say something like whydon't once in a while you'd hear someonesay something like why don't we line upall the sprints and everyone just startsstomping their feet saying hell No, youcan't. They want to do a three-weeksprint, but we like four-week sprints orwhatever it is. And it's like um I usethat as an example because that didhappen a couple times where like someonethought like, you know what, we shoulddo is line up all the sprints across ourorganization and all the engineers arelike, \"Oh, that does sound a good line.\"Bear as a dove. Yeah. And I appreciatelike I I really like that culture oflike someone says we should all flip toMacs and like no, I like my Windowslaptop. Why? Because I do. Or likesomeone else has a Linux laptop. It'slike, well, I'm just going to do thatbecause I feel like it. And um unlessthere's a reason to dictate it, like areally really strong reason, the defaultanswer is just everything goes to thelowest level. So again, like you're oncall because it's your software and itit feels in most cases like you're in asevenperson startup or a 10 personstartup because like you picked yourlanguage, you picked your your uh howyou deploy it, you picked how you QA it,you picked, you know, how you monitorit, you you set your own monitors andalarms. It's not like there's someglobal Amazon click the alarm buttonlike, oh god, no. Like you have to makeall this stuff up and people make it upwrong, but you learn, right? you I thinkthere's a lot of skills like uhyou know I can't name the exact gaps butsometimes you you know I would talk tothe Facebook engineers and like they'venever dealt with an emergency of likehow fast you know it's like where arealarm you know where are that was likean example was I said something aboutlike where are your metrics and stufflike that for this system and they'relike I don't know I'll have to go lookfor them and I'm like blew my mindbecause if you're an Amazon engineer youhave a freaking hot link on your browserright because you have to click thebutton really fast when there's anemergency and see all your alarms andthey better be on like one one bigdashboard with the alarms that you knowabout and the metrics you know aboutbecause you support this system and youknow exactly how everything works andyou know that your memory usage ishigher than usual so what the heck isgoing on and so um I think it justbuilds a lot of skills at that likereally low level of like we own thewhole stack we own the product we youknow frequently like you're you'remaking product decisions because there'snot enough product managers for yourspace or things like that so on thefrugality side of things for exampleWell, so I'm sensing that you're like asan Amazon engineer, you're actuallyreally close to, you know, the themetal, the work. You're in a small team.You you have a lot of ownership, youryour whole team. You have to wearmultiple hats. You you cannot afford tolike, you know, like buy all sorts likeuse budget cuz Amazon doesn't want youto. plus that's not my problem issomething that you know that's one ofthe quotes in the leadership principleis like you you can't say like that's aproduct decision and like go la I don'twant to make a decision like no dudelike sorry you're an engineer I know butyou have to make this product decisionnow and then you also need to listen tocustomers and stay close to them whichis already I guess like you know like aa startup founder would like say likethese are my ideal folks plus on top ofit when you leave any big company GoogleMeta uh uh maybe even Microsoft, you'reused to internal tools that do not existoutside of the world. But with Amazon,especially these days, you're using AWS.Guess which one is the most popular?Yeah. you're lucky service. I would sayboth lucky but also I definitely heardteams at Amazon switching to publiclyavailable tools in part because they sayI wanted to learn this like this is apopular tool these days which is againis like one of those big advantages of aa a system like Amazon where you canjust choose to use whatever you want issomeone saying the hot new way of doingAndroid development is X so we're goingto do that for our for this next projectbecause we you know us collectively onthis team want to learn that tool sowe're gonna use it like that's prettyawesome likeSuch a good way of keeping on top oftech is being able to say we're justgoing to use whatever we want and we'veread a lot about this thing. It lookslike it's popular so we're going to tryit out. Yeah, this is awesome. I mean mymy view changed a little bit aboutAmazon because it just seems like unlikesome big tech jobs that you know you canyou either go to big tech or become afounder. This Amazon does open multiplepaths. You can keep going on in largertech companies you can you know found astartup because you've kind of seen howit's done. You can join a startup. Youcan join a scale up. Pretty cool. Yeah.And I think I think the the downsidewhich I would say absolutely exists atAmazon is related to the likeindependence thing of like everyone cando whatever they want is uh imagine thethe manager who says we're going to beworking on these projects. No, we can'tgo do that operational excellence. We'rejust going to put two people on call andwe'll get paid 17 times a week. And likethere's not the uber Amazon policyholder who says like you manager aredoing it wrong. you need to be firedright now. Like, so so you do end upwith these pockets of just absolutehorribleness because people can dowhatever they want. And so once in awhile you talk to someone and you hearabout what it's like on their team. AndI'm like, that sounds horrific. Like Ican't believe your team sucks so much.And so when someone says, you know,you'll see on Reddit or something aboutlike, you know, oh my god, don't go toAmazon. Everyone leaves after 6 months.They don't. Like the actual stats arenot at all. But in some pockets they do.But in some pockets they do. Absolutely.I have met teams that had no no one like13 engineers on one team. No one had atenure more than 12 months because theyall left. They were all leaving. Peoplewould join the team, realize howterrible it was and they transfer offand it just like just pop on, pop off,pop on, pop off because the team wasterrible, the manager was bad, theirsenior manager wasn't paying attention.Like there are these pockets ofterribleness. And so again on the likeif you're in a bad spot, move somewhereelse. Internal transfers are great. AndI assure you like I was in six orgs. Ihad a bad manager I guess sort of liketwo bad managers. They were both firedlike everywhere else was great. Like andthose places became great after I hadnew managers. And so I had greatmanagers. We had great orgs, greatpeers. And you would just see pockets ofterribleness here or there. That'salmost like the inevitable downside ofhaving thousands of little startupsaround the way is like once in a whileyou end up with a really bad situation.I know you had a short at Facebook aswell but in total how long did you spendat Amazon? I think it was a little over12 years uh at Amazon little Amazon abit of Facebook afterwards you had alittle stint. I took a leave of absencein the like towards the end I took aleave um uh but yeah and then you workedat at Basil Academy for a little bit aswell but then you made a decision toretire. What what and you're you'restill young. You don't look 65 to me. Sohow did you decide on retiring and andyou know like what did it take to buildup a kind of financial independence tobe able to do this and what do you doright now? So yeah. Yeah. So many yearsago, I have no idea how I got so luckythat I stumbled on the idea of financialindependence and read about a bunchabout it and learned math uh you knowlike financial math in terms of likewithdrawal rates and investment thingsand um index funds and stuff. And somany many years ago and in my 30s orwhatever, yeah, I guess that's a whileago. Uh I I early 30s, let's say, uh Irealized like how much money I wouldneed and like keep an eye on ourexpenses every year and stuff like that.And so, uh, Amazon pays well, stocks goup, like over time. If you're makingtech salary, you don'tThey did. They used to back in the day.Back in my day, stocks actually theyYeah. Yeah. Hopefully they will againsomeday.Um, and I would say almost like as fortech workers, it's like keeping an eyeon your expenses is probably moreimportant than keeping an eye on yourincome because you're probably makingenough to retire if you don't spend alot. Um, and so thankfully my wife and Idon't and it comes down to that kind ofthing. And so a good number of years agoI built a lot I mean I don't know eightyears ago I built a spreadsheet and Icould tell about when we would haveenough money where I wouldn't need towork anymore. And that was my positionwhen I was getting promoted to directorat Amazon. I could see like essentiallylike my next vestings make us way pastmy safety margin and so I don't need towork anymore.Um, so there's just like that thatfundamental like what am I going to dowith my life when I don't need to when Idon't need to work. I can keep working.I enjoy working like some some aspectsof it. Like some I don't like waking upin the morning and commuting sucks. Butum I I really appreciate sometimes likewalk hanging out with smart people andtalking to them or or doing creativethings. So Bezos Academy poached me outof Amazon at a convenient time when Ididn't need to work anymore and I washaving a little bit of that existentialcrisis of like what do I do next with mylife? Um, so they poached me. I workedthere for a bit and then ended updeciding that that's not like the rightkind of job for me. Um, and so Ithought, well, like my dream since I wasyoung was to write a book, you know,actually like fiction book. I want towrite sci-fi or fantasy about dragonsand stuff, but how do you force yourselfto write? Because I've been wanting towrite for years and I have likeliterally 20 stories of like 50 pageseach. Um, and so I thought, well, how doyou force yourself to write regularly?Newsletter is an obvious answer. So, I'dwritten years before while I was atAmazon, I'd written a few very populararticles on LinkedIn that just sort ofblew up. Um, one of them was one, themain one, in fact, was like the Amazonleadership principles article that a lotof people know about. Y uh where I'dwritten an article or sorry, I'd writtenan email that I would forward to peoplewhen friends or family or relatives orwhatever else said, \"Hey, I want tointerview at Amazon.\" I would forwardthem this email that essentially said,\"Here's what you need to know aboutinterviewing at Amazon.\" So, I turnedthat into an article on LinkedIn. And itbecame wildly popular. And so, Ithought, well, why don't I do that more?Like, that's sort of fun. I I I'll do anewsletter for a bit. I I start anewsletter and like by the second orthird article, I had like thousands ofsubscribers. And I was like, holysmokes. Okay. Well, I need to write apaid newsletter is what I need to dojust for fun. And this was literallylike I just see the tools where I canclick paid and say like you could payand like how much should they pay me? Idon't know, $5. Um, so I just pushedsome buttons said I I thought I'll justwrite two articles a week then. Sothings have changed over time, but ingeneral it just blew up and for a whileit was I'm going to write a new article.Scarlet Inc., right? This is ScarletInc. Yeah. So the short thing forScarlet Inc. is I got that uh uh domaina long time ago when I thought like Iwant to do some kind of writing, a blog,a newsletter, a a book, something. Um Iwanted red ink because I always like thered pens at Amazon when I mark updocuments, you know, document culture,right? You sit there like with a pieceof paper in front of you and I'd alwaysuse the red pens because I could see itbetter against the uh uh blackprintouts. And so I thought red ink, butred ink was taken and it was reallyexpensive to buy the domain. So Ithought scarlet, it's even moreliterary.Scarlet ink. It sounds really fancy. So,um, so I got Scarlet Inc. I wrote theScarlet Inc. newsletter. It was reallyfun. Um, and I was writing for a bit andI kept think I kept saying and thinkinglike I'm I'm just sort of on a sobaticalwhere I'm writing and then I'll figureout what I want to do for a job like doI want to take another nonprofit job? DoI want to go to a startup? Do I want togo to, I don't know, Google or Microsoftor something? And I did a couple smallinterview like I talked to some peopleat Google. I talked to some people atother companies and it was like me. Butthe newsletter kept growing and thenit's you start to get to the point oflike but why would I go to a companyagain when I'm making so like I don'tknow a couple years a year and a halfago two years ago I sort of crossedwhere we were making in my newslettermore than we were spending and so like Ihaven't actually withdrawn any of myretirement money withdrawn any from theI mean it's only grown because I don'tneed to touch it because I have thisnewsletter going and then it gets tothis weird point of like why would I goget awhen I'm writing a newsletter thatalready pays me a salary and I'm notspending all that much time on it. I'mnot commuting. I'm sitting in my littleofficehere writing one artic I end up writinglike one article aweek. I enjoy writing. I sit down. Iwrite for a few hours. Sometimes I'llwrite over a period of a few days. LikeI'll just, you know, sit down for acouple hours, write something,brainstorm. I'll be on a walk and I'lltext myself an idea of something I couldwrite about.Um, and so you sort of like the idea ofgetting a job fades away when yourealize you have so many other thingsyou can do in life.Uh, sitting in the office and beingforced to do it for 40 plus hours a weekdoesn't sound quite appealing. So soundslike you you built up really goodsavings as a mix of just working inBecktech being at a good time wherewhere you know like there were stocksawarded where where yeah back when stockit was appreciation but you also readupon financial independence the planningyou actually started to make a plan andthen there was this point where youcrossed the boundary where like okay youare financially stable and you couldafford not to work you kind of exploredsome things different things you knowlike the the nonprofit job at at the thebasisacademy whether you should work at othercompanies and then you just didsomething that kind of like just workedout. Sounds like because you didn't Isit fair to say that maybe it worked outcuz you just didn't really have thepressure? I mean if this didn't if ifthis like once a week newsletter didn'twork out, you probably would trysomething else, right? Because you youhave no pressure right now. Yeah. If youimagine. Yeah. And that's it's I don'tknow if it's responsible for thenewsletter working out. The fact that Ididn't need it. I mean, if I reallywanted to make it work, that probablywould have worked. Also, I think alittle bit of what might have happenedwas um if you're not trying to impresspeople, you your work product forcreative things is probably a bit betterbecause I'm not I wasn't and I I don'ttry to appeal to like what do peoplereally want to hear? Like what's the hottopic? Like I I've only written about AIlike once or twice. Like I think onlyonce like real an article about AI,which is mostly saying like now it's alloverblown. Um which I still believe in.Um, but uhuh I think that for the most part it'slike you're writing about the thingsthat you think are interesting or whatsomeone else has talked to you about andyou're like, \"Oh, that was such a coolthing.\" Um, I did some I did actuallysome co like one-on-one coaching for awhile, too. Like that was like one ofthose side things once I started writingand I actually I think when we first metyou, you were still doing a little bitof that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I wasdoing hourly coaching and then I my wifeand I argued about it cuz it was like Iwas making a lot of money doing hourlycoaching and uh I kept raising my ratesand she's like, \"Stop it. You're notgoing to get any more work.\" I'm like,\"Well, I know cuz I don't want to bedoing this anymore.\" So, I kept raisingthe rates trying to send people away andthen I started feeling guilty cuz I wasmaking such an huge amount of money perhour and people were still signing upfor it. But then you start to have thislike performance pressure of like, am Iworth that many, you know, that muchmoney? like, \"Oh my gosh.\" Like, \"Holycrap.\" So, uh, uh, I lowered the rates alittle bit and then people were stillbuying and I I ended up just turning itoff. I just told everyone like, \"Sorry,I'm I'm not getting joy out of itanymore.\" And I don't know why I'm doingit. It's it's a weird existentialproblem to run into when you likerealize that money incremental moneywon't change anything other than like anicer car or something which is likelike fundamentally something like if youif you feel that way like this is howyou reach financial independence is notto keep growing your spending because alot of people be like I got a raise so Ispend more. Yeah. If you stop that fromhappening at the right time then as yourcareer improves and you make more andmore money the only thing it's doing isincreasing your savings rate and that'show if you have a good tech job um overtime like it you know you can affordthings and save 15% and the next timeyou know your next raise you can save20% of your salary and then 25 and then40 and then you know by the end we weremy wife was working at Amazon which ispartially how this happened. I mean, sheshe retired a couple years before me,but you know, we had two tech workers.We were saving like 85%, I think, of ourincome. Like, it you can retire prettydamn fast if you're saving 85% of whatyou make. Um, and then where did youlearn about financial independence or orfor people who are thinking about like,okay, I'm actually inspired. I'd like tolearn more. Where did you start? And doyou have some pointers of books,resources?Yeah, the internet. Um, I would say, uh,yeah, Mr. money mustache and he doesn'twrite as much anymore but you coulddefinitely he has some pretty fantasticarchives. The Mr. Money mustache is ablog you know newsletter. Um MadScientist was another one who also he'sbeen retired for years. It's sort offunny like you these financialindependence newsletters in particularare just sort of hilarious becausethey'll be like I have you know $10,000and I want to retire in five years. Andso they write like mad for five yearsand they're like I've made it. like Ithink I've made it and then you noticelike the newsletters just sort of petersout and stops like they'll write onceevery two months because they're busywith their life and like the the drivingthat's what they wanted to do. It wastheir thing. So uh almost no activenewsletter exists that was from the timeof which I originally read about it.Um uh but yeah, Mr. Money Mustache, MadFientist um are the biggest ones that Iread about at the time. But um therethere's a good selection of of umactually if you hold on one second.There'sa I was going to look up the book. Uh II can look it up right now. There therethere's a a book that I recommend on umon my website. In fact, you can set itover and then we'll put it in the shownotes after show notes. Yeah. Yeah. Thiswas really fun. Yeah. Both aboutsoftware engineering and a little bit onmanagement. We didn't go into too muchdetail this time, but perhaps on a on afollow-up one. Yeah. Well, thanks verymuch for for being here. This was fun.Oh, thanks for having me. It's been fun.I enjoy uh uh chatting on these topics.I hope you enjoyed this deep dive intohow engineers at Amazon work, as well ashow working at a large tech company likeAmazon could help getting to earlyretirement like Dave has done. So,thanks to Dave for a great conversation.You can read more from him on hisnewsletter at scarleting.com and you canfind him on social media as linked inthe show notes below.

    "summary": "This YouTube video features Dave Anderson, a former engineering manager and director of engineering at Amazon, discussing his experiences working there for over 12 years. He provides candid insights into the engineering and management career levels (L4 to L10), the interview process (including the bar raiser role), performance management, on-call responsibilities, and Amazon's unique culture. Anderson contrasts Amazon's approach with other companies like Facebook and Google, highlighting differences in incident management, tooling stacks, and the importance of operational excellence. He emphasizes that Amazon prioritizes having engineers support the code they write in production, leading to a strong sense of ownership and accountability.\n\nThe conversation delves into the realities of promotions at Amazon, the performance review system, and the \"unregulated attrition target,\" acknowledging its potential for creating anxiety but noting that it often impacts only a small percentage of employees directly. Anderson also discusses Amazon's frugality, its impact on employee perks, and the surprisingly decentralized nature of teams, where individual groups often have significant autonomy in choosing their tools, processes, and development approaches. He makes the claim that because Amazon's engineering teams operate with some startup-like qualities, they often thrive when transitioning to startup environments. He concludes with a brief discussion about his journey to financial independence through smart saving and investing, and how that lead him to create a newsletter called Scarlet Ink.\n\nUltimately, the video provides a comprehensive overview of what it's like to work as a software engineer at Amazon, offering valuable information and perspectives for anyone considering a career there or interested in understanding Amazon's engineering culture. Key takeaways include Amazon's emphasis on ownership, its rigorous performance management system, its unique approach to incident response, and its surprisingly decentralized team structure. Anderson's experience demonstrates how an engineering career and responsible financial planning can lead to professional opportunities and early retirement."

    "transcript": "Welcome to the startup. Today we have onwith us we have Tee. Say hi Tee. Hi Tee.All right. Uh we got Casey Miratori.Hello everyone. And we got DHH the racecar driver himself.All righty.So by the way today we got a good topic.Topic is should you go to college?I thought the topic was is college worthit? That's a different that's adifferent question. The topic is, iscollege worth it? Nailed the intro. He'sgot it first try right here. All[Music]right. Uh, anyways, sorry. Is collegeworth it? Hey, David, you are on theshow for the first time. So, why don'tyou kick us off? Is college worth it?And as the only non-American,well, is it worth what? Is it worth 10grand? Yeah, I think it's worth 10grand. Is it worth a quart of a milliondollars? in debt? Absolutely not. Unlessyou're guaranteed to be raking it inwhen you get out on the other side. Ithink the weirdness of all of this iscoming from Denmark where the state willpay for your college education. Thestate will spend like last I looked itup, I think it was something like 10grand to educate you. So to hear thatpeople go to college where you can spend$90,000 a year for a four-year degreeand I think that's even without room andboard just sounds insane. I don'tunderstand why Americans married theidea of getting education with getting afour-year cruise. Like why did that haveto be the same thing? Oh, you also get afive-star hotel thrown in and by the wayyou got to pay for it for the rest ofyour life. That just seems insane to me.Not the idea that you have to or shouldget an education if you're so inclinedto get high education, but that you'regoing to pay a ridiculous ungodly sumfor it that you're going to carry onyour back for the next 10, 15, 20 years.Is there any education that's worth itthat is worth the 250,000? Like, isthere some role that it's like, okay,it's fine because is it purely justbecause you're going to make money? Isthat your argument? Like so like adoctor doctors come out they spendobviously hundreds of thousands ofdollars because they have to go to youknow college for eight 10 years justlike me but I'm not a doctor and likedoes that is that the same thing are youokay with that because you know they'regoing to make a lot. I think that's atleast afinancial sort of situation that canmake sense. I know in Denmark there areeducations where you spend a lot. If youwant to become a pilot that's reallyexpensive and you normally take on somesort of loan agreement or you sometimestake something on with the military,you're going to do this amount of yearsof service and they're going to teachyou how to become a pilot. But in theUS, this idea that you can spend 4 yearslearning Russian poetry and that's goingto cost you 100 grand, 200 grand, 50grand, 20 grand. Like on the other side,like what the [ __ ] are you going to do?How are you going to make that moneyback? I think it's just absolutelymind-blowingly insane that there's asystem set up where the loans are backedby the government, which means thatthere's no skin in the game for neitherthe lenders nor the educationalinstitutions to actually producesomething that will create a return thatsomeone is going to spend aproportionate amount on the education asto what they're going to get out of itfrom a job. And I I mean, I'm not evenagainst Russian poetry. I think thereshould be people who study that, butthey shouldn't be perhaps encouraged totake on an obscene amount of debt forprospects that just aren't there to everever pay it off in the end. And I thinkthat's really what just fires me upabout all this stuff is that theeconomics are so warped. And it allseems to hinge on this idea that likewell if we can just convince uh I don'tknow a president to forgive all theloans without changing a damn thingabout how the system works somehowthat's going to be good. No. No. Thefundamentally flawed part is that thereis there's no skin in the game forlenders. There's no skin in the game forthe universities. And there's just abunch of 18 year olds being askedwhether they would like free money totake a four-year [ __ ] cruise to comeout of the other side with a degree inRussian poetry that's going to pay$22,000 a year. Like what the why whyare you doing this to kids? I thinkthat borders into something that'smorally reprehensible. Even if you cansay like, well, you knew you signed onthe dotted line. You could have read theIt's not even fine print. I mean, youactually do have to be slightly [ __ ]to think that you can take on $200,000or $100,000 worth of debt and that thatdegree in Russian poetry is somehowgoing to work out. But you know what?That's what 17 year olds are. That'swhat 18 year olds are. They're [ __ ]in the sense that like their brains arenot literally not fully formed. I thinkthe the female brain formed a littleearlier, the male brain 25, that's bythe timein my experience, there's stillsometimes a little time left to cookeven after 25.So, I think it's it's just I mean it'sjust a really bad constructto entice kids to take on these massiveloan burdens with the entire pressure ofa society telling them that if theydon't go to college and preferably ifthey don't go to a prestige college,they're [ __ ] right? Like their lifeis over. They they're never going tomake any money. They're going to be aloser, which by the way isn't true.There are plenty of losers who finishtheir four-year degree and again saddledwith a bunch of debt and can't get ajob. And like that's a fair definitionof a loser. In fact, it's a worsedefinition of a loser than someone whodoesn't go through all that and at leastdoesn't have the the debt burden, right?But this idea that we've shuffled allkind of societal pressures towards youhave to get a college degree becausehey, look at the statistics over time,blah blah blah. Yeah. Also, we need somewelders. We need some carpenters. Weneed a bunch of other professions tokeep society [ __ ] running. And someof them can be quite lucrative, right?So even just for an individual, there issomething really screwed up about howthe encouragement system goes. I thinkuh Mike RH and the whole 30 jobs thingsand so on I is absolutely spot on in myoptics. Um but all right, not everyonewants to be a welder and and some folksshould go to college. We should alsohave a bunch of educated people. Wedon't need to take that a desire and aneed for education and marry it to aluxury cruise that's going to cost anobscene amount of money.Like developers, are you tired of codereviews that just say looks good to me?Or here's seven things I need you tochange that are irrelevant to the PR.Well, meet Code Rabbit.

You bring up a really good point,which is these 18-year-olds can make adecision that's going to cost themhundreds of thousands of dollars, butthey can't even buy alcohol cuz we thinkthey're not responsible enough to beable to drink alcohol, which is kind oflike a really funny kind of world welive in where it's just like, oh yeah,they totally get a life decision that'sgoing to saddle them with debt for thefor the next 20 potential years of theirlife, but hey, you can't rent a car yet.Honestly, you're not you're not capableto rent a rent a car, but hey, you candefinitely make this decision. like oneis way worse than the other one and it'sjust far more impactful. That's actuallyWell, that's why the the car companydoesn't want to let them rent a car cuzthey know they're going to make baddecisions and the car company's going tobe the one.Yes. If if if that 18-year-old crashesthe car and the company renting themcan't recoup that money because the[ __ ] 18-year-old doesn't have any,they know, you know what, that wouldn'tbe smart. I should not rent this personmy car because they're going to crash itand I won't be able to get my moneyback. Therefore, I'm not going to do it.And I think that's by the way at theroot of all this is good intentions. Thegood intention that if we underwrite theloans, the student loans, more peoplehave access to loans, which means thatmore people will have access toeducation and zero consideration hasbeen taken to like the second ordereffect. What happens when there's justfree unbacked money with no skin in thegame? Yeah. prices are going to go tothe moon and who's going to vacuum allall the excess capital administrators.You you've seen the graph, right? It'slike since whatever 1960 completeflatline with uh professors andeducators and adjuncts and then you seefrom 1980 forward the chart just goesparabolical when you look atadministrators. I what was the the stat?something like some college had a 10 to1ratio of admins to students or somethingjust truly bizarrely might have beenColumbia I think or something. Yeah, Iremember seeing something like that.Yeah.Can't be real. There can't be 100,000.He's not really exaggerating that. Idon't remember the exact point either,but like there were there were numbersthat would be absurd, right? I rememberit being I'm going to [ __ ] ask AI.It's more ridiculous than absurdnumber. Yeah, it had to be likeadministrators to professors. For everysingle professor, there's 10administrators because students wouldjust be just would be the mostridiculous. Yeah, it was it wassomething like 10, but it was like oneto one with students. It was like it waslike the same number or something. Itwas insane. Okay. It's like having acompany and you have more managers thanemployees. Like everybody's walkingaround like we're managing. Here it is.Thanks. Thanks. Uh, chat GBT. Uh, atYale, 5,460 administrators managingfewer than 5,000 undergraduate students.More than a one:1 ratio. What? What? Youdon't think you're paying for that? Youdon't think you're paying for that hallmonitor like all the time just dedicatedto you and only you? It'd be one thing,too, if they like literally followed youaround. They're like, \"Yo, we're goingto we have a person whose sole job isthey're going to follow you for 4 years.We're going to optimize everything aboutyour life. We're going to get you in thebest classes. I'm going to be reachingout to people to get you internships.I'm going to be like, yeah, yourpersonal assistant, your Yale personalassistant, right?\" And also, like, itgets drunk for you. Like, whoever thatperson is, they get drunk for you. Theyget in fights for you. They date foryou. All the stuff. And then you justget the outcome, whatever it is, at theend of it. Imagine you could just belike, \"Hey, can you ask out the personalassistant of so and so over there and wecan sort of figure out if we're amatch?\" And then like we'll go on adate. I'm too busy studying and workinghard. But instead, it's like, \"What arethese people doing?\" Absolutely. Whatare these people [ __ ] doing? Well,first of all, they're making your life[ __ ] miserable.100% the college experience that had a1:1 ratio of admins to students isinfinitely worse than the experience of1967 that had 100 students to oneadministrator whatever the ratio used tobe 100% that experience is worth worseand I think I mean for me the greatillustration of this was during co wherestudent was just treated like cattle ina cage and you're thinking like waitwhat people are paying for this they'repaying for this [ __ ] experience Theydon't even get to go to classes. Theydon't even get to have the joy of thatfour-year uh cruise. They get to beconfined into a dorm. And then there'san administrator that's going to runaround and yell at them if they walkoutside without a mask on. Well, whatare you doing? This is just insane. Andthen like did they not just admit likeYeah. Well, we I know you guys didn'treally learn anything this semester, soeveryone just gets an A. They didn'teven like pretend at the end of thesemester. Like I had younger siblings incollege like during COVID and they'relike what? We just didn't do anything.And you're like, \"What do you mean? Youstill got the grade? You didn't have tolike repeat or anything?\" \"Oh yeah, Igot a check for that.\" You're like,\"What? What?\" That's I didn't even knowthat was a thing. That that is that'scrazy. That's like the Okay, so I can'ttell what is the worst part about or thebest part about college, whether it'sthe actual education or the fact thatyou're going through college with peopleapproximately your age, learning thesame topic, and being able to kind oflearn how to argue with each other andreally become a full-formed adult andall that. If you're not even going toschool or class during that time, andyou didn't get to be around otherpeople, like the whole entire collegeexperience doesn't make any sense. Thisis also my whole problem with remoteeducation. They're really there's a bigpush into like remoteify all aspects oflife and it's just like how why wouldyou ever pay to go to a university whenlike the true value of a university isin the moments of being around peopleand learning in some sort of co- kind ofway like those were those weresingle-handedly my best experiences incollege and really where I learned howto become actually a good programmer wasact was the afterlabs after hoursarguing about an ACM programmingcompetition figuring out how to solvethe coin chain problem because none ofus were ever able to do it and there wasno just chat GPT to spit out an answer.It's like that's where the magic was.Well, I would actually argue like oneone greater than or one more severe thanthat I guess I would say which is thatcollege what it really is as far as I'vebeen able to determine is like ainstitution that is extracting moneyfrom you while getting the value fromyou. So, it's basically a a strictlyone-sided thing. All of the students whocome together, they're actually thevalue like you interacting with theother students and stuff like that andbeing there and, you know, going throughthe process is valuable to you andvaluable to the other students becauseof each other. But the actual educationyou're receiving is usually not verygood compared to that, right? andcompared to the other, you know,resources that you now have availablefor learning things. And the reason thatI think that's somewhat like the reasonI think there's a reasonable amount ofevidence for that is just because peopleright now are doing stuff like usingchat GPT to cheat on their papers orwhatever, right? And all this sort ofstuff. If you were going there for theeducation, you would never cheat becausethat's like paying for something andthen not taking the thing, right? That'slike buying a car and then saying, \"Oh,keep the car. I'm going to walk. It'skind of like getting a gym membershipand never going to the gym. So, we knowwe know like basically it's like no thething what you were getting was whateverwas happening with you and the otherstudents thing and the credential at theend is the part that you actually caredabout and wanted to pay for. But the theeducation receiving can't be that goodcuz people aren't even mad when theydon't get it. Or like with co people areprobably like sweet I didn't have toread all the books for that class. Ijust got the A for free. That wouldnever happen if you felt like the thingyou were getting was really valuable,right? You would never do that. You'd belike, \"Oh my god, I object. Like, I wantthose classes back. I need to study thatparticular piece of Russian poetry andyou didn't let me do that.\" Right? Yeah.I want to inject one thing, which is thereason why that's true is because thesekids are [ __ ] in the same way wejust talked about. They're [ __ ]taking on 200 grand worth of studentloan debt, right? They're not literallythey their brains are not formed. theyare forming that is what the universitycollege experience is supposed to doright but in that moment no they don'thave that I didn't have that I mean Iwas always thrilled whenever class wascancelled I was like sweet um so they'renot thinking long term because literallythe brain is not done with the part thatdoes long-term thinking so when you'reasking them like hey do you know whatmaybe you should study because who'sgoing to care about this diploma by theway not a lot do by the time you getinto say uh programming. If you'regetting a diploma for for programmingand you don't know how to program, thatdiploma ain't worth [ __ ] right? True.There's a status token in that diplomathat may open some doors, may give youan opportunity, may give you anaudition. You still got to [ __ ] act.You still got to be able to do thething. I mean, it's all good that youcan apply and you'll make the first cutuh of the recruiter sorting. Oh, thisperson went to Yale. Like, let's makesure that they are in the second roundof this [ __ ] And then you're going tobe at the whiteboard and then [ __ ]what? What are you going to do? Youdon't know anything because you justcoasted through everything. You spend anenormous amount of money for a statustoken that's going to be revealed in asecond to be worth nothing. Now, I don'tknow how it works in, I don't know,investment banking. Maybe the statustoken there kind of opens some doors andeveryone is full of [ __ ] in investmentbanking. You don't have to knowanything. I mean that's the stereotypeprogrammers would like to believe aboutfinance people I think or maybemanagement or something. You go intomanagement consulting but also I meangovernment I don't actually think that'strue. I do think you'll you got to havesome smarts to it right. So I thinkyou're exactly right. It's an awful dealawful deal to pay way too much even ifit has something of value. It's an evenworse deal to pay all that money forsomething of zero value. And I thinkagain that's part of the that's why kidsgo to school because they don't [ __ ]know anything or everything they have.So they think they do. I remember I Iremember knowing everything. DHA. Okay.And I mean that by the way that doeshave value, right? Like the ignoranceI'm actually a big fan of when it comesto a lot of things. It has to be backedby some degree of competence or at leasta trajectory towards competence. But ifyou have those things, ignorance isgreat, right? Like it allows you to notknow how hard it's going to be andyou're going to start and you're goingto be delusional about how big it'sgoing to be. And do you know what? Maybeit will be, right? Like I started my uhprogramming adventure when I was 20somewell before my prefrontal cortex wasfully formed. So I'm I'm not againstthat. I mean, I think what what you saidabout how wonderful these years can be,how formative they can be, it 100% hasvalue. 100% something that I'd sayanyone who's sort of cognitivelyinclined to pursue higher educationshould try to get. But why would youpick the most expensive version of that?Right? So, you know what? I'm going tomake a a computer parallel here. I'vebeen testing these mini PCs, right? AndI bought this mini PC that's$313 from Minis Forum. $313. I'm like,\"Holy [ __ ] I I'm making a lot of money.I should just buy it the best.\" Right? Ibuy this thing for $313. I'm like, \"I[ __ ] can't tell the difference. Ihave a $2,000 computer next to it and a$4,000 $4,000 computer next to that. Ican't tell the difference.\" Like I ifyou're notjust money is unlimited, you're a [ __ ]if you buy the $4,000 computer if the 33or the $13 computer can do which that'show I look at American education likehey if you just do instate if you justdo instate like what 80% of it is paidfor whatever the state rate is somethinglike six seven eight grand or somethingseven grand a year for me it's a lotcloser to the Denmark model if you goinstate right exactly exactly becauseit's closer to just like sheer cost.Mhm. Why would anyone who does not havethe money just to throw around go intodebt to get essentially the sameproduct, right? Like I I understandthere can be differences betweencolleges but for most people gettingmost educations like you know what ifyou're not really going to class ortrying to learn and you're just usingyou're going for the sort of the socialexperience and all that good stuffthat's great but I think it'sjust there's a weird um prestige luxuryproduct aspect of this that is just soactually repulsive in many ways when youthink about what it is and what theconsequences of it is Like, do you knowwhat? If you can afford to spend uh$20,000 on a watch and you just it'snothing to you, great. Like, do it.Yeah, I've done that. Great. I I That'sthe spoils of having succeeded in someways. If you're spending $20,000 on awatch and you're making like 40,000$45,000 a year, again, you're [ __ ]What are you doing that? No. The Casio,which by the way, Casio makes some sweetass watches. One of my favorite watchesis an $18 Casio, right? Well, you pay 20grand. It tells the time worse. It's aluxury item for people where money atthat scale just doesn't matter, right?It's the same thing with education.Like, don't don't do the same thingunless your parents are paying for it.Unless there's some direct line whereyou can just see like, all right, if Ido this, it's going to open that door. Iwant to work at whatever JP Morgan orsome other company where I know thehuddle goes through Yale or some otherstatus token. Uh anyone else? Yeah, it'sjust dumb. So I guess can can we putsome blame on the industry here thoughbecause I feel like if if the industryat large like let's say like you know acouple of these big companies you knowAmazon, Microsoft, Google, whoever ifthey actually came out and said we'renot going to look at college degreesanymore period like HR is not going touse them for screening. They're notgoing to get handed the interviewer.We're just they're off the resume. Wejust white it out and send it on. Ithink that would have a major effectlike overnight on whether or not peoplebecause there probably are nowadaysespecially with thanks to the internetand YouTube and all these things wherepeople can hear more opinions they getmore information they can access otherthings. I do think people would be like,\"Oh, cool. All right, awesome. Then I'lljust study my on my own or I'll justwork with some other people, you know,in a study group on the internet andI'll learn programming and I'll and I'lldo this sort of stuff and then I know Iwon't be disadvantaged when I go toapply to one of these jobs.\" But thereality is that the HR departments, whoby the way, none of them have any ideawhat programming is or how it works atall, right? I can just tell you this,like they have no idea what a goodprogrammer looks like. None. Right? theystill use to do first pass screening andthings like this. They will use thingslike CS degrees and I've checked thatrecently like I've asked people atcompanies like that, you know, is thatslabing? And it is. And so I feel likewe're we are to blame to some degree forstill using this like expense plusattrition plus whatever you want to callthe like filtering process that collegeis. Like, could you grind through fouryears of having to listen to professorswho themselves don't know how to programtell you stuff and then still getthrough that after and pay $80,000? Ifyou can, maybe you're more slightly morelikely to be a good employee for us. So,we're going to make you all do thatfirst. If we could get rid of that, ifwe if we took it upon ourselves to getrid of that, I think it would be a muchbetter world. But the industry isn't.They're still doing that because there'sa little bit of signal there. I thinkprobably, right? I I think you're also Ithink there is we're confusing a littlebit which is that there was a time incomputer science when it was justcomputer science and programming waslike the expression of computer science.It's just like hey Google we'redoctorates we're researching bettersearch algorithms. Oh wow we started acompany hey we are a bunch of doctorsand now we need to get other people tohelp us with this. We should hire otherdoctors. Right? Like there's this actualcomputer science giving birth tosomething that was a product. But mostof the things that are happening todayare more akin to a trades job. like,\"Hey, I need you to sit down and I needyou to go to the pixelmines and swingthat like pickaxe for the next eighthours to kind of just make some sort ofprogress on our product and then I wantyou to go home and then I'm going tocall you at 2 in the morning wheneverything crashes and burns.\" Likethat's what you're doing. It's a 99%trade job. It's a 1% like educationaljob. Whereas I think if you wentbackwards in time, you would see muchmore, hey, this is closer related toresearch than it is uh closer related toa trades job. And so I think there's awe're in this weird shift where we stillhave all the holding backs of theprevious time and now we're in this kindof trades job because I'm sure there wasother times that where this has existedin other industries. I'm sure it hashappened but right now I that's what Imean I think that's why education isstill accidentally important is that westill have this hold back. It I mean Ican go backwards in time. I was born in1976 and now you can go backwards. neverwas like it like there was never a timewhen the putting you know when actuallydealing with the reality of computingdidn't require the trades job partmostly like in fact if anything backthen it was like if you weren'tprogramming assembly language youprobably weren't really going to have apretty well functioning product rightwhereas nowadays no one does that rightI mean not no one the ffmpeg team doesright yeah and occasionally some of thepeople at RD game tools or whatever buteveryone else right we write insomething at least slightly higher evenif we're doing performance stuffusually. So I would say actually goingback in time there was even less of anargument for CS. Yes, it was a valuablething to have a few people working onit. You know you wanted your new andyour dystras and and stuff like thatdoing work because we want to know stufflike how do we do shortest pathalgorithms or things like that. Butgenerally speaking that's a very smallnumber of people and you usually don'tneed very many of those people if any tomake a software product. Even then, youdidn't need that many of those people tomake a software product. I would argue Ijust skill man the other side for asecond because there's too muchagreement here and I don't like it. Yes,go for Yeah, go for it. Um,do you know what? I believe the 10Xprogrammer is 100% real. Perhaps even anunderstatement because remember the 10Xprogrammer is not saying that the bestprogrammer is 10 times better than theaverage programmer. It's saying that thebest programmer is 10 times better thanthe worst programmer.I think that it's a vast understatement.I think it's probably the 100xprogrammer is true or maybe even thethousandx program, 10,000x programmers.I've seen some shitty programs writtenin my life and I'm like when I've lookedat what that output is and I compared itto the best programs, the bestprogrammers, I'm like I would not trade10 of these idiots for one of thesegeniuses, right? Well, it's genius isworth way way more. So to steal my likewhat if and I don't fully believe thisbut I'm going to present it anyway. Whatif the kinds of people who can make itthrough a Harvard CS degree were in thejust abstract classical sense before DEI[ __ ] like this was actually thecream of the crop of the crop, right?Like it was your perfect SI SAT scoreindividual just like IQ150. that individual has been filteredthrough because Harvard only has thesefew spots and like that they get thevery best and then you get arm thatperson with a CS degree and you let themloose on sort of run-of-the-millsoftware and what they do is they don'tjust they don't just do the thing rightlike they make a machine to build moreof the things and that the leverage youget out of a 10 or 100x programmer isactually worth it now I don't actuallythink this is happening And I don't eventhink Google knows it's not happening.Google did this multi-year study ontheir hiring processes where they weretrying to figure out like what's thesignal? Who ends up doing really welland who ends up not doing very well.They didn't find a signal. They couldn'tgo like, oh, it's because they have anMIT background. Oh, it's because theyhave this or that. But at least thepursuit of it does make some sense in mymind because I've worked with a lot ofprogrammers in my time and the capacitythe productivity of the very best isjust on a completely different plane. SoI don't I don't disagree that companiesthe very best companies the mostvaluable companies the richest companiesin the world should try to find thosebecause if you do find one they can dothings that most people are not going todo. Now, is your task worthy of that?Like, if you're some regional office fora third tier rental company and you justneed to have your form updated, like isthat worth the super genius to apply tothat problem? Probably not, right? Like,we need multiple layers of it. Um, buteveryone also wants the best, right?Like they or they want the best thatthey can get. So I don't actually I alittle bit sympathize with the idea thatthe Googles and the fangs and whateverwho worth trillions would go like butthink about the cost right this is theway I look at it it's like I I totallywant them to be trying to get the bestright and the problem is the collegesystem doesn't do that filtering as faras I can tell and so what what I wouldlove is if they took it more seriouslyand went okay how do we build somethingbecause What we know is that you couldspend$80,000 perperson and still come out ahead on thatfiltering because that's how muchHarvard or whatever is charging thesepeople, right? Well, now I think thoughit does get uncomfortable because ifyou're like what are the raw materials,okay, that's worth that kind ofinvestment. Okay. And I think and Ididn't I I've never taken Naiku test inmy life and I'm kind of afraid that if Ido one like I'm not going to like theresults. Just do three of them. You'llscore super high. You just once you doone, you get a higher score every time.I'm thinking 100 still enough of them.You'll be like this wonderful book aboutI went read this wonderful book about umthe correlations with IQ and like it wasactually kind of sort of depressingbecause the amountof set trajectories or at least umwhatever confidence intervals thatoriginate out of that point is actuallyrather great. And that means that theresimply there is a hardware difference,right? Like some people can make up fora lack of hardware with some incredibleother ingenuity. But generally speaking,if you take mass numbers, you need acertain amount of hardware. And that'spartly what the SAT is. It's an IQ testby another name. Um that's what leadcode is.lead code is essentially, hey, here's anIQ test or an IQ derivative and itsucks, but it's going to produce asignal that at least like thisindividual has the hardware to performat the top level because you know what?There's no amountof smart tricks you can do at like 95.Like you're not it's just that's notgoing to be your profession. It's justnot it's not there, right? So I think umthis all these ways we're searching forit to at least find the sort of thepotentials of the very very best um tieinto that notion that both college thethe admission to college and all therest of it is essentially trying to susout like who's the smart cookies. Againthere's a million not a there are manyother variables. You're right. Very fewof them are as determined as that one.You you have a point there which is thatat least in the US I guess companies aresort of prohibited from usingintelligence test as part of hiring aspart of like various sort of civilrights legislations and things likethis. I guess I've heard it said anyway.I've never actually looked to see whatthe case law is on it but that they'renot allowed to actually administeradminister something that's roughly likehow smart is this person. They're not.Yeah. They're not right. And and so Iguess you could say is, you know, if wewant to be really blunt about it, isthis just a legal issue? Is it like doesthat just need to go? And then it's likethey could put a screening process inplace that would allow anyone who couldshow sufficient ability to get throughit without paying the$80,000 uh or it might probably mass$200,000. I don't know what it costs togo to Harvard these days. It's probablyabsurd. I think it's north of 200. Andwhy would you think Harvard? I'veactually never met a good programmerfrom Harvard. Maybe there are some myhardware experiences are actuallyhorrible. Yeah, calte all theprogrammers for Caltech are unbelievablygood, right? Uh so yeah, but so Caltech,whatever it is, but point being likewhatever that cost is, I feel like, youknow, you you would want some way thatpeople could just demonstrate that theythey're good enough and they've studiedenough on their own to get through itwithout having to go through that wholeprocess that simply isn't accessible foranyone who doesn't have a lot of moneyor isn't willing to go into a hugeamount of debt, which isn't good. Butbut also isn't that I mean and I'm not abig fan of it and I [ __ ] hatealgorithm in general, right? But isn'tthat what lead code is? Like lead codeessentially if if you can crack the toptiers of that. I mean unless you'redoing it with AI, it is a intelligencetest. It is a filter. And I think atleast from what I've heard from a lot ofhiring processes, a lot of it has sortof leaned heavily into that. That thatbecomes a qualifier. If you can reallysmash lead code and have the tenacityand the time and whatever and thefirepower up here between your neuronsto grind it for three months and we'reable to do those hards like at the veryleast maybe you're not a greatprogrammer which I actually thinkthere's something to that too. I metsome very very smart people who are alsoprogrammers who I would not want toprogram my code. Yeah. Right. Correct.But but I mean I'd say on on averageyou'd rather want a smart person than anot so smart person working working nextto you um as a programmer. I think maybeactually the industry what happened withlead code was somesense of trying to get towards thatright can we can we just route aroundthe fact that universities are actuallyno longer as you say all that great of afilter like they're broken in all theseways they're not as meritocratic and asfocused on um objective scores as theyonce were and therefore they're not agreat signal here's another kind ofsignal which by the way has beencompletely blown out of the water rightlike AI killed lead code, right? So,yes,I'm going to go with an opposite take onthis one, which is uh I I don't like theidea of intelligence tests. Um because II think that intelligent tests, onething that they largely lack the abilityof is to identify wisdom in somebody.I'd much rather hire a wise, not sosmart programmer who's going to make theright decision given enough time than Iwould to hire the super smart personthat can make fast decisions, but theirdecisions may be incredibly unwise.Because I always define just foreverybody, intelligence is the abilityto solve a problem. Wisdom is theability to know which problem to solve,right? Like which which one would yourather have? And I I don't think thereis a standardized test that's going tobe like and this right here is how wiseyou are. Here's your wise score, sir.Right? Because it's just going to it'sjust going to be completely broken. It'sgoing to be absolutely a crap test. Andso for me, I don't like the idea of likegated things based on some sort ofnebulous scoring, especially when itcomes to things like IQ or leak code.Cuz the reason why I specifically don'tlike those is any of those tests, youtake them more than once, you will dobetter. Like that's a fundamentallybroken test that if you're like, \"Hey,how intelligent is this person? Let'smake him take a test. Okay, they didsomething. Let's make them take anothertest.\" They are now proportionallybetter than they were the last timethey've done it. There's something a bitbroken. That's a very wellstiedphenomenon. If you have if you just getone move it. You're not going to move itthat much. You're still going to moveit. But 10 points is a generation of ofintelligence. Like it it doesn't you'renot going to you're not going to move IQ10 points. I mean, I'll send you I sentyou some references on this on thistopic because I mean what's interestingabout IQ testing is it's one of the fewareas of psychology that replicates umwhere basically like everything elsedone in the last goddamn 80 years seemsto fail replication time and again. umIQ testing and its um correlation withpositive outcomes in other aspects oflife and professional performance is isvery well established. Not to a totaldegree and I I completely agree with youin the sense that like I've met somevery smart people who are alsoincredibly stupid, right? Like they havethe the firepower, but it's not beenprogrammed well, right? Like there'slike, hey, you got a you got an M4 chiphere and you're running some shitty asssoftware on it. like this chip could doamazing things and you're not doingthat. Um, now either way, I think thefundamental problem is no one hascracked hiring. And I say that assomeone who who's currently in the finalstages of trying to hire threeprogrammers. Um, two we're trying tohire who are juniors and one who's asenior. And [ __ ] it's really difficult.It's really goddamn difficult. And it'sactually only gotten more difficult nowthat the best test that we've used foryears and years, which is sort of anat-home programming test. Um, not eventest, well, maybe it is. You build aproduct or something at home and justhave we give you a constrained uh partof one of our applications likesomething that resembles the work youwould be doing day-to-day and we ask youto extend it in some specific ways. AndI've always found it so fascinating howthis test has been able to reveal to mealmost right away whether I would wantto work with this person or not in waysthat all the other signals as you saylike oh this person went to Yale likeI'd be actually inclined to go if youcould make it through a 4-year programat a Ivy Leagueinstitution at least historically youwould have to be pretty smart. So that'sa good signal. It's just it's not it'snot the determinant signal to me. Thedeterminant signal and now I can lookback upon 25 years of hiring otherpeople, hiring otherprogrammers. Seeing someone work withthe real kind of code they'll be workingon on a day-to-day basis with me is Ifound no better measure. The problemwith that is a it's hard to do at scale.So the the tests that we ask applicantsto to do they take like four to sixhours. I not only do they take 46 hours,which is a lot to ask for someone who'sapplying for a job, you better well bequite a ways down the pipeline beforethat request comes up, right? Like youdon't want to give that test to to athousand people. It also takes quite awhile to assess it, right? So I can'tprocess a thousand uh applications thathad that kind of uh test in it. Um soit's a latestage but really nice test. And now Ikind of fear AI [ __ ] it. Yeah. Right.Oh, absolutely. But I mean I say thatand then we actually this last test wewere just about to get we gave it to allthe models, right? Like every I think wedid like six models like all right solvethe thing. And some of the models you'relike do you know what that's notactually bad and what was interestingabout it was the solutions that modelwould come up with would be quitereminiscent of a lot of junior code. andyou're like, \"Shit, we're trying to hirejunior programmers and if I can't tellanymore whether it's AI doing it or notbecause I'm giving a lot of allowances,right? If you're hiring a juniorprogrammer, you're not going to ask thesame things.\" None of the models wereeven remotely close to the bar I wouldset for a senior programmer in terms oflike the the code and so on. That I Iheard there's not just a new whatevercla dropped that people are freaking outabout in my feed. So maybe maybe nowwe're all the way up there, but at thejunior end of scale I it's really hard.How are you going to figure out whoyou're going to give a chance? Yeah.Yeah. Well, I would also I do want torewind a little bit. Can Can we rerewind? I wanted to rewind with you,Prime actually. Um Okay. Where So whereare you rewinding to? Just I would liketo be a touch more focused on collegemore itself in the sense that we haven'tquite answered if college is worth it.We we've all I think we all universallyagree you probably shouldn't go $400,000into debt over especially over aneducation that is like largely based intrades if you will with programming likeI think there is a good argument to bemade in that but there's also theargument that there are countries whereyou you must get a degree if you expectanything like if you go to India if youif you were born and raised in India youcan't just be like ah I'm just not goingto get a degree and succeed like theydon't have a you know a culture aroundthat you're going to largely fail simplybecause you didn't go to school So thereare also immigration like a lot ofcountries immigration requirementsincluding the United States you you getpreferential treatment if you have adegree in something that you're gettinghired for you will get preferentialtreatment in many c uh countries becausethe government uses that as a standinfor competence and what I would say isthe reason I think we're talking aboutthe screening process part though primeis because that's the problem theproblem is that companies don't have theability to put in a good screeningprocess. I understand your uh your umuneasiness with something like an IQtest and I kind of share that with youbecause one of the problems I find so Iknow eugenicsis I can't eugenics allthat is b IQ is based on I just can'twell sure yeah I mean whatever there's athere's a bad history but also I thinkthe process has a couple issues toowhich is that because they're trying todo a standardized test with somethinglike an IQ test they're focusing on yourability to concentrate on very smallproblems So problems that have very lowscope and especially in the world ofprogramming, one of the things that Ifind that people who I would considervery smart but are terrible programmers,usually the reason for that is theirability to conceptualize large scopedoes not exist. Like their abil liketheir the degree to which they can spenda lot of time thinking about largerthings or to hold the larger things intheir head is compromised for whateverreason. But they do have tremendousfirepower on a tiny thing. So, you know,that's not to say they're necessarilygoing to be a horrible programmer at allthings. You could you could reallyclearly like just go optimize this loopor something and maybe they could reallydo that because it's so tiny. But whenyou're talking about I want someone, youknow, like um David was saying, seniorprogrammer, someone who's going toconceptualize this system and know likenot to do stupid stuff, they can't dothat, right? Even if they're maybe highIQ, because they can't hold the wholething in their head, right? Whereas umsome of the other things like is whatcould this person be a great novelist orsomething that actually probably bearsmore on could you be a great systemsarchitect because you're holding allthese things in your head and knowinghow some fuzzy things will interrelatewith each other and will they play outwell and so while I share your concernabout that I would say it's still nomatter what you think the screeningthing is still a screening problem atthe end of the day and outsourcing thatscreening by saying what we're going todo is have this four-year thing thatkids go to that they pay all this moneyfor and then they get a degree. And bythe way, the entrance to that isbasically an IQ test. It just it'sridiculous, right? It's not it's anonsensical solution to this problemthat probably made sense in the pastwhen it was hard to bring peopletogether, right? You having professorsin one place to work on stuff togethermade a lot of sense before the internet,right? Nowadays, it's like, do we needthese antiquated ideas of buildingswhere the people gather? Like, can we dosomething better? And can we dosomething better than charging people$200,000 or whatever to go to certainones with limited accessibility so only3,000 people can go through it? Blahblah blah blah blah. It's like it justseems antiquated like a horse and buggy.And my question is just can we make thatpipeline that's part screening, parteducation, can we make it better? And Ithink the answer has to be yes. Andunfortunately, we're not trying. That'swhat I would say. IQ test aside. I Ithink you're also focusing on we'refocusing on unique colleges. Um thereare a good university right now. Uh youmay not I I know this going to soundlike I'm just kind of tooting my ownhorn here, but the uh school of minds inSouth Dakota. A they've been uh in theACM World Competition, which there'sonly been like what 17 of them, 20 ofthem has been hosted here because ofthat, because of how good this school isat like just problem solving, right? Buton top of it, every single graduatingclass universally gets just hired out byGoogle every single time. All 50 just gostraight into Google, straight into thispipeline. And so I do think there aresome schools that are just objectivelybetter and they have created a cultureand everybody that goes to the school.It's not just about learning becausethat's I think that's one thing thatwe're kind of breaking down. This is whyIQ tests again fail completely is that ajob is not simply your ability to applyknowledge. It is also your ability tolike interact with others. And you willnever get that in the day and age of onthe internet. That's why I think likeDiscord, as great as it is, is also areally kind of bad thing for a lot ofpeople because they abstain from havingreal relationships, real interactions,being able to look somebody in the eyeand talk to somebody for a while andinstead they have this kind of nicefiltered screen and they don't ever haveto do that. I actually during college,one of my interviews was for uh thenaval underwater warfare group up inSeattle. And the reason why I gotselected out of all the kids to go anddo like the on-site interview is thelady was like, \"You're the only personthat looked in my eyes while you talkedto me. Not a single other student madeeye contact the entire time.\" And it'sjust like I won by simply beingsociable. Like that's how I got in. Soit had nothing to do with whether I wassmart or not. I I would like to think Iwas smart, but nonetheless, it's justbecause I was able to just talk toanother human being, which is a a skillI fundamentally received by being aroundpeople my age doing the same thing,solving the same problems. I thinkthat's where like the real again, that'swhere I think a lot of the value is isthat I think it's just in the group withsome sort of smart person hopefully atthe head leading people. TJ, you haven'tsaid a single thing, so TJ, you got toget in. Thanks. I've been trying, butyou know, you keep you keep hopping inPrime. It's just been your I got anotherthing to say and I'd like to say itright now. No. Okay, go. I'm going tomute you right now. Uh, I have thatpower. So, Prime, you can talk again ina little while. Uh, no, I'm justkidding. Um, do that. I have to touchRiverside and ruin everything. Pleasedon't do anyway. So, um, the thing thatit feels like so often there's there'stwo things that I feel like for somereason a lot of hiring doesn't at leasttry and factor in. I don't know how youdo it. I've I've had experience withdoing the take-home project before.That's my favorite interview that I'veever had. It was at the first startupthat I worked on. submitted it at theend of the week, blah blah blah. It wasgreat. They paid me for my time, whichwas cool because it was a big ask,whatever. Um, but one is like whatyou're saying, Prime, programming likein a company is way more than liketyping into the computer. You have tolike figure out what your customerswant, what your clients want, what otherpeople on your team want, whathistorical decisions were made for thecompany because of differing businessexpectations 6 months ago or a year agoor 10 years ago or 40 years agodepending on where you work and likewhat are the things that are coming up.So there's a whole bunch of like socialand like relational things and like alot of businesses relationships anywaysoutside of just like can you even getyour product working? like why doessomeone stay with your product orwhatever. So, and like you know a bunchof these have no factor. It seems likethey just like the only way they testthat is the first phone screen wherethey're like, \"Oh, are you a human?\" Andlike you talk to some HR person andthey're like, \"Cool. Uh, you canaccurately reflect your birth date andyour name. Congratulations. You've madeit past the first round.\" And you'relike, \"That was it? That's the onlything we're going to find out if I wantto work with this guy later.\" Um, andthen the second thing which is kind oflike it's related to the idea of like10x programming is that like the worstsoftware developers are like waynegative x programming in the sense thatthey not only do they not do the thingyou're looking for, they actively setyour entire company back either by likeliterally taking down prod all the timelike the most obvious one but they canjust make code that makes it worse towrite more code in the future. So, it'snot only that, oh well, we just had towait 6 months and Billy finally finishedthe feature. It would have been cool ifthat was six days, but it took sixmonths. It's like, no, Billy took 6weeks to make this and now no one elsecan ship to prod. No, like no one elsecan figure out what Billy did and nowit's broken forever. So that like andthe long tale of that is like there's alot of area under that curve of peopleI've like worked with or seen where theyactively just make the entire product uhworse. And then the last thing too isthat there's some scales where you can'teven compare. Like for me I can't run amarathon. Like I like physically Iwouldn't be able to like finish one. Iwould get eliminated. I would getdisqualified, right? Like I wouldn't beable to finish. literally can't getdisqualified, but somehow you wouldfigure it out. TJ, well, they likeclosed it down at some point. They'relike, \"People have to drive on the roadagain.\" It's DNF. Did not finish. Thisexists in a marathon. Yeah. And that'sthe same thing is true for a bunch ofsoftware projects. I've worked withpeople who like no matter how much timeyou gave them, no matter how whatever,they're just not ever going to fix thisparticular problem due to technicalcomplexity or handling all the scope orlike figuring out the way that thecustomer actually wants to use thething. So that's like infinity xprogrammer like the there's there's nocomparison. It's it never happens orsomeday it happens. There's infinitydifference between the two and like allof those things it feels like it just itdoesn't seem like people care about.Maybe it's because HR departments at thebig companies are in charge of a lot ofthe hiring process. I don't know. That'swhy I feel like I'm taking crazy pillsover here, you know. Can I say one thingreally quick before we get in too likethe before the YouTube comments justfill up? It'd be an undefined differencebetween programmers, not infinity. Cuz Ijust know I know that's going to be thetop comment if I don't say that. So,okay, keep going. Okay, I'll go get mymath degree out and then I'll have toburn it because I have It's a divide byzero. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I have amathematics major and I failed them.Sorry. Sorry. Uh cuz it's a divide byzero. Right. So you you have you knowyou've got this person finished it in insix days and this person will neverfinish it. So it's 6 over zero is the isthe ratio between those two. And it'snot infinity. Infinity time zero willnever be six. I mean I'm sure there is amathematician somewhere who's likeactually in this particular type ofgroup it is. And I'm like, so that willbe the second top comment. So I had tosay that as well, but I just thatmathematician infinity. Oh, go ahead,Brian. No, it's just undefined.Infinity. This is not You want amathematician, not me, to tell you this.So, but it's undefined because there'sno there is no ability to reach it.Period. Not not at infinity. It willnever happen. This is the zeroxprogrammer one who never finishes.All right. Anyway, go ahead.Well, yeah. So, anyway, so those arejust some of the things where I feellike college college can help you insome of those verticals, right? Wherelike you can get some skills forlearning how to work with people ifyou're like actually trying at college.Like I went to a small liberal artscollege. I lived at home to save moneyand like, you know, didn't have to payroom and board. Thanks mom and dad.Shout out mom and dad. They didn't makeme pay rent while I was living at home.Uh, you know, and like but I didactivities at school. I met people. Imade relationships, talked to myprofessors, you know, like they helpedme get internships, whatever. I learnedhow to work with people and makeconnections. Awesome. Those things wouldhave been a lot harder for me likeotherwise cuz my dad's an accountant andhe doesn't know anybody. My my family isfar from tech adjacent, you know, likewhat you know, my mom's a music teacherand my dad's an accountant, right? likethere was no connections to get intolike software world. So like that can bethat first vertical can help you out alot in college if you're payingattention and trying. But you could alsospend your whole day on Discord likeyou're saying prime playing video gamesand never talking to a real human atschool which seems crazy. It seems likethat would be impossible but it'sdefinitely possible. Twitch chat canback us up. Half of them are that guy.Go out and talk to somebody. Um, right.And and then it can also help you withsome of the other problems because youcan like talk to your professors andfigure out how these like you could justyou got to do some of those thingsthough. It's not going to be the schoolhanding those to you. I thinkyeah, for me the bottom line here is uhif you I mean we're talking toprogrammers here. If you aspire to be aprogrammer, I think going to college istotally worth it at the right price. Andit's all about the price. Like a productisn't bad or good. Mo I mean someproducts are just truly bad at anyprice, but a lot of things that exist inthis world are bad or good depending onhow much they cost, right? Like you havecompletely different expectations aboutwhat you get out of something. If youdidn't spend the next 20 years worth ofsalary on it, if it was something moreaffordable, more approachable, I'd sayit'd be far more of a no-brainer. Ithere's a lot of kids in the US where Ijust feel like no, it wasn't worth itfor you. Even if you got like a decenteducation, it the price was just toohigh. Yeah. It's like Warren Buffett uhalways said, like there's not a good orbad stock, there's just a good or badprice for it. Again, caveats of companygoing out of business is literally worthzero. But with almost everything, it'sall about what is the price. Yeah. And Ithink too, like the opportunity cost,like I was just talking with a guy whowas in the middle of school and then Idon't know if I can say the company,some nice company that is doing welloffered to hire him and so he just leftschool and then he's working there. Andit's like the opportunity cost was gostay at school and maybe get the samejob later or just like go there and workfor two years and then if he needs to hecan go finish the other two years ofschool. Awesome. Good for him. I waslike, \"Dude, that's so awesome. I'm sohyped for you. He's moving to SanFrancisco. He's going to go do histhing.\" Like, that's really good. Itried to convince my younger sister.She's 10 years younger than I am. Shejust graduated school. But when she wasstarting, I was like, \"Yo, I will youcan come work with me for 4 years andyou only have to pay me half of whatyour tuition was.\"[Laughter]And she didn't take me up on the offer,but I was like a little bit seriousactually that if she really wanted tolike try and work with me, like we coulddo basically like a tradesman thing, Iwouldn't have actually charged hermoney. Although I wish there was more ofthat. I was just talking to someoneabout that. that programming in generalseems exceedingly well suited for theapprenticeship model. Exactly. For allthe reasons you guys were mentioningthat this is more of a trade in manyways. If you take the total sum of allprogrammers out there, the vast majorityof them are trades people and they wouldlearn more quicker, better if they wereapprenticing under someone. Yeah. And Iwas like, \"Your resume will lookcooler.\" Like you have real jobexperience for four years as opposed tolike one little degree spot that getsdiscarded like at a lot of places. Um,but there were other, you know, therewere other factors or whatever. But Iwas like, I would, you know, that wouldhave been cool like to be able to dothat. And I think if there were moreoptions like this or ways for this tohappen, it would be really exciting tosee cuz I think like the tradesmen likeI have a bunch of friends, one of mybuddy one one semester of college waslike this sucks. Quit started plumbingimmediately. He was a professionalplumber long before I graduated school.Was doing great. Owned a house, married,you know, the whole thing. And it's likethat was awesome for him. But they dothe apprenticeship model. He went and hefollowed a plumber around and didplumbing things, you know, and it's likethat would have been way better if thoseopportunities I think existed inprogramming more often.Do you think Oh, so do you thinkspending four years at an accreditedplace in the site of AI now that it'scoming down and all that, do you thinkthat it is still just practically worthitat the right price? Yes. I I I want tosay that what David said is exactly theway to think of it. It's like it youhave to know how much you're spendingand and if you don't know how muchyou're spending on it then I don't thinkyou could make that decision because itcertainly does change the equation. Itmeans that now like you know if youdon't think you're going to be very goodat this thing eventually then a highprice school is simply not it shouldnever really be considered at that pointright because AI will be AI will betaking some of the hiring awaypresumably right uh if for no otherreason than like the the juniorprogrammer thing where it's like if youhave someone who's never really going toget all that good well AI at least whatI've seen of the programming from AI itlooks like somebody I would never hirebut that I know does work at a number ofthese companies, right? That's what AIlooks like. It looks like like I wouldnever let this thing anywhere near anycode I was working on, but I know a tonof code bases where this is just a likeaccepted commit, right? Microsoft startmenu, right? Oh, yeah. Like for example,this thing, you know, the the AI couldjust produce the same quality as that,right? like, you know, brought to youthat by the people who said that itwould take a very long time for them tofigure out how to make it uh so that youcould put it back on the top again likeit used to. That was like a huge thing.They were like, \"Well, there's a lot ofwork that would have to go into that.\"I'm like, \"Yes, that's the AI would beoperating at about the same level asthat start menu, right?\" Um, but I guessI would say that does affect the marketthough because plenty of programmerswere currently in that trench of, youknow, not very good. And so that doesremove that does change the the marketdynamics. Even if AI never really getsany better than today, it still changesthose market dynamics at least a littlebit. Which means that price that youshould be looking for is going tochange. That price for education can'tbe as high. It has to be a little bitless if if economics is, you know, ifeconomics works the way we think itdoes, right? And the other opportunitiescan't be like as good. That's the otherthing that I feel like because if morepeople are like hiring or like trying todo apprenticeship or like you can evenjust try like I'm not a huge boot campguy or anything, but like you could trya boot camp for way less money and seeif you can get hired for like and yougrind on that for a year instead ofgoing to school. Like just even makingmoney for three years instead of payingmoney at like any ratio is like thatadds up really fast. Like even if you'remaking 40,000 and not spending 10. Yeah.That's 200k difference in your life.Like that's a lot of money, you know? Sothe other opportunities I'm interestedto see what's going to happen with withlike AI and with what is softwaredevelopment going to look like? whatwhat or like what are CRUD softwaredevelopment jobs going to look like, youknow, cuz there's a huge portion of themarket where it's like I don't know. Idon't know what that's going to looklike. Market Yeah. They're just likemarket firms that just build simplesites for people. That's a big thing.Mhm. And people need them. So, yeah.All right. Um, there's a common thingthat everybody says, and I'd love to geteveryone's got to go soon. Oh, okay. D,I want your 15 seconds super hot take onthis one. Shoot. Every single programmersays that they want to be a farmer. Arethey delusional or is it true?They're absolutely delusional. I don'tthink most programmers who say that haveactually ever spend a day on a farmlooking at what it is. But I also do Ido think there's something true in it inthe sense that working with a computerall day can be alienating in a sensethat I don't actually get from as manypeople as I know who have worked farmingthat it isn't deeply alienating in thesame way. So I totally get theaspiration but I I think it isdelusional and the vast majority ofpeople actually would do better not totest their delusion because it's thedelusion that gives them hope. Do youknow what? Life sucks right now. Thisweek sucks right now. But you know what?I can imagine I could be a farmer andI'd be happy. And if you test out thatdelusion and you find out it's not trueat all and you can't hack it for 4 hoursmilking cows, what are you left with? Nohope at all, right? Like total nihilism.So like keep your little delusionsaround. Like keep them little jars ofum of illusions because if you take themdown and examine them too uh close, youmight find like Yeah. You know what? Alittle alienation can uh get replacedreal quick by existential dread. Loveit. That was absolutely great ending.All right. Thanks so much for having meon. That was really Thanks for coming.My pleasure. Today's show was sponsoredby Code Rabbit. And so I just wanted totake a quick little moment to shout themout.

I just Dude, I set up a secondscene for three people just to see ifthis would work and oh my gosh, itworked. Let's go. Let's go. I did notexpect this to work. Anyways, uh hey,that was awesome by the way. No, I Arewe never met him before and he What afantastic guest. Oh my god. He was He isone of my favorite people in the univer.Are we still live? Are we still live?We're still live. Okay. All right. Justmaking sure. I I thought we were stilllive. I meant to say that live if uh ifif possible because I I really enjoyed Ireally enjoyed what he had to say. Yeah.No, I absolutely uh I absolutely am justa huge fan of what he has to say and Ithink he he's right on a huge portion ofthings. Now, I'm still not on your guys'team with the whole IQ test thing, but Ido say anything about IQ, so don't lumpme into anything. Well, like I said,that was more his thing than minebecause like I like I said, I I don'tfeel like it captures I don't feel likeIQ tests capture what I'm really lookingfor in a programmer because they wouldonly really tell me like howhyperfixated they can be on smallthings. So, like I don't know. And youknow, I'm not up on the psychologyresearch here. Maybe it's true that IQgeneralizes out to that more or lesslike or as well as any other test wehave and that could be true but at leastfor me I prefer screening to besomething more actionoriented like okayhere's this like larger pool of thingsgo sort through it figure out how to dosomething with it right and uh uh thatkind of stuff if you were going to dosomething for screening I would think itwould be more like that and not like anIQ test but I so I'm not really I'm noton the same page as DHH was. I guess ifif he's actually suggesting that an IQtest would be useful, but I am on thesame page in the ter in the terms oflike it it'd be better even an IQ testwould be better than the system we havenow is just saying bad college is like avery roundabout method of like IQ plussome other stuff. I would also say I'vedefinitely seen and or seen some code by155 IQ Haskell geniuses that nobody inthe world should have ever written andshould be wiped from the face of theearth. So if it's just IQ then theywould get hired and they would bring thecompany to an end. Goodbye. That's theend of everybody waiting right now. Byeeverybody. Boot up theday. Vi potent errors on myscreen. Terinalcoffeeand living the dream.",
    "summary": "The YouTube video \"DHH IS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING (Again)?\" features a discussion on the value of college, particularly in the United States, with David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) offering a critical perspective. The central argument revolves around whether the high cost of a four-year college degree, often leading to significant debt, is justified given the potential return on investment. DHH points out the absurdity of spending exorbitant amounts on education, like studying Russian poetry, with little guarantee of a commensurate financial return. He contrasts this with countries like Denmark, where education is heavily subsidized, and questions the societal pressure forcing young people into massive debt for what he considers a \"luxury cruise.\" The panel explores alternative career paths, like trades, and the pressure to attend prestigious universities, questioning whether the filtering process of colleges accurately identifies talented individuals.\n\nThe conversation then shifts towards the role of companies and their hiring practices. The panel criticizes the reliance on college degrees as a primary screening tool, even though HR departments often lack the expertise to assess programming skills effectively. They discuss the concept of the \"10x programmer\" and whether elite universities like Harvard truly produce such individuals. The discussion touches on the limitations of intelligence tests like IQ tests and LeetCode in evaluating wisdom and the ability to solve real-world problems, highlighting the importance of social skills, collaboration, and understanding customer needs. They also consider whether AI might take certain job roles with some participants discussing how the current education structure may no longer be worth it when AI can write code at the same level.\n\nUltimately, the panel concludes that the value of college hinges on its price. While a college education can be beneficial for personal and professional development, the exorbitant cost, particularly in the US, often outweighs the potential benefits. The conversation emphasizes the need for alternative educational pathways, such as apprenticeships, and a more holistic approach to hiring that values practical skills and problem-solving abilities over traditional credentials. They also touched on how if students could make better choices like attending an instate college and taking advantage of financial aid, college may still be worth it. DHH closes with a final thought about how a programmers should still hold onto a few of their delusions, because if there hope is shattered, the life is just existential dread."

on YouTubeSean welcome to thepodcast thanks it's great to be here I'mbig fan of all your stuff going backmany years so really exciting to get totalk to you so to start off what isshipping in in your postuh you wrote and I'm going to quote youI know it sounds extreme but I thinkmany injurers do not understand whatshipping is even inside a tech companyso what is it my post kind of came fromthis experience of seeing um a lot ofEngineers around me and myself in thepast getting into this frustratingposition where they were delivering codethey were feeling happy about theiroutput particularly the volume of theiroutput but they weren't um getting thekind of recognition they felt theydeserved uh and the sort of managementchain seemed happy or or seemed unhappyor even worse just seemed totallyindiffer to what they were doing um sothat's that's kind of the context inwhich I I talk about shipping and thecontext in which I wrote my blog post soin that context uh I say that shippingis uh kind of a socially constructedfact which sounds like this postmodernway of talking about things but itactually cashes out really concretelyinto the proposition that a project isshipped when your management chainbelieves that it's shipped and liketalks about it being shipped so shippingkind of means doing things that yourmanagement chain is happy with and I saymanagement chain because like for smallprojects this can be your manager andjust your manager but for largerprojects um it's usually a layer or twoabove your manager particularly for likestaff roles um and sometimes it's uh itgoes all the way up to the CEO and inthose cases the metric of whether aproject ships is is the CEO happy umwith what you with what you'vedone that can be a kind of frustratingway to think about things I think for alot of Engineers uh certainly the comerson hack can news found it that way Ithink partially because it relinquishesa lot of control you know it's notnecessarily about the quality of yourwork it's kind of about how it'sreceived uh but I do think you you havea bit of a happier experience going intothese projects with open eyes and Ithink you tend to be more successful ifyou're actually driving for this kind oflike organizational definition ofshipping rather than just saying Iclosed all the J ticket so the Project'sshipped I deployed the code toproduction so the Project's shipped uhthat that definitely does not mean thatit's shipped you can deploy something toproduction uh and it can be a completedisaster this episode was brought to youby DX a platform that helpsorganizations measure and improvedeveloper productivity the DX teamincludes notable researchers behind theFrameworks like devx and space sothey're constantly asked by leaders whatmetric should we use to measuredeveloper

dimensionsincluding speed Effectiveness andquality that provide a focus set ofmetrics that help track productivity atall levels of the organization you canlearn more about the DX score 4 and howit's being used in companies likeDropbox Etsy versal and fiser at getdx.com cor4 again that's get dx.comslc4 something that feels wrong aboutthis definition isis it kind of sounds like you know we'veShi successfully if the management chainall the way up to CEO is is happy andthey're like all right great job but itkind of goes really against like I thinkwhat a lot of us feel is shipping whichis does it work for customers and usersthe people who care about it this goes alittle bit back to you know like agilelike the the original agile Manifestowhich talks about customers doing stufffor customers how do you think that isconnected cuz clearly I can see on oneyou know if the customers are happy theCOO is happy but you might have thingswhere like I don't know the customersare not happy and the COO is not happyand like you you've been doing this forquite a while but surely you needed toreconcile this and also think about thisfact I want to say a couple of things onthis uh first kind of you touched onthis in the question but I do want tostress that in any like remotely healthycompany uh your management chain wantscustomers to be happy uh they wantcustomers to be happy because they wantcustomers to be paying money they wantmore people to be using the service youshould be aligned with your managementchains goals here if your managementchain want customers to be unhappy andwant the company to make no money thenyeah you might ship and make them happyby deploying code uh well by doingwhatever but you know you probablyshouldn't be at that company you'redefinitely not going to have afulfilling experience so I think likethis idea that you're making your bosseshappy instead of making customers happykind of presupposes that you're workingat a company where those things areintention and I certainly in myexperience I've been lucky enough thatthat at Xander and now would GitHub youknow people tend to want customers to behappy um the other thing is sometimesyour management chain uh has good reasonto make decisions that are going to makecustomers unhappy and sometimes youdon't have the context for that sothere's lots of reasons um that are veryimportant to the company I could wecould spend the entire rest of thepodcast listing them off and that mightbe a really interesting podcast but justto give you an example um sometimes acompany is in trouble and needs toposition itself as being in a particularspace uh recently AI is a good exampleof this so you need to ship some kind ofbox ticking Fe in order tolike have a really positive impact tolike the success of the company usersmight not like it that's a shame itwould be better if they did butsometimes you need to ship it anyway uhI want to be clear that GitHub is not anexample of this like our AI features areactually actually topnotch that's partof the reason I'm here um another reallycommon reason why why why companiesmight want to justifiably ship somethingthat users don't like is uh security andRegulatory Compliance um if you've everbeen at a company that's that's gone forsay fed ramp uh you'll have to shipfeatures that kind of satisfy these likethese um what is what is fed oh I'msorry uh it's a a US Government kind ofregulatory uh set of requirements Iguess that make it so as I understand itthe um entities within the US governmentcan use yoursoftware y yeah it's one of the now Iremember as well one of yeah it's aseries of of regulations if you want todo business yeah and there's I guessexamples not just this but a lot ofother regulations yeah exactly and andsome of these things particularly in therealm of security controls mean thatyou're compromising the kind of customerexperience a little bit and doing thingsthat customers won't like uh because forinstance you have to be more carefulabout the way you you manage API Keys uhyou might have to make them uh expireover time users really like having theirAPI Keys live forever it's veryconvenient uh but you can't always dothat um those are two reasons there's amillion others but just to tied back tothe original question like the fact thatyou're writing code that doesn't makecustomers happy might make you feel badas an engineer but it's not necessarilyuh counter to the interests of yourcompany and there's lots of cases whereI think it's uh quite literally your jobparticularly as a very senior engineerto kind of suck it up and to prioritizethe company's the company's goals overlike your own goals uh and and how youmight be building the project if it wasjust your personal project and it didn'thave the kind of stakes that working ata at a large company has you touched onon how as a senior engineer very seniorand you're staff level engineer it isyour job to help the the business tounderstand the business as well what wasthe point where you recognize this youlearned this because this is typically alearning that I mean ideally it comes asas you grow but what was the point whereyou realize okay that that is my job nowthat I'm at the staff or above level uhyeah I I learned this one the hard wayum sort of sort of the story of of ummistak so uh I I was a very enthusiasticand very motivated engineer early on Iwas just happy to be there I was reallyexcited to like not be in Academiaanymore uh so I was absolutely absorbingthings I was I was I I cared a lot aboutwhat I was doing um which was good butit it kind of uh pushed me into a coupleof pathways that I think weren't superproductive so one of them was um back atzendesk you know or at this point like 6years ago uh we had this Suite of uhstaging tests for the stagingenvironment that were pretty unreliableum for a whole bunch of reasons notworth going into but it was my like holymission for six months to like keep themgreen and keep them like up to date andI shipped fixes I shipped improvements Ishipped reliability improvements to theto the tests I spent a lot of time andeffort kind of like catching up to otherEngineers work where they shipped somefeature that changed the UI whichchanged the test selector you know thisthis was something I cared a lot aboutum and I felt like I wasn't getting alot of like rewards for it but you knowpeople seemed kind of happy about it andthen after about 6 months um I saidsomething in a meeting where Icomplained about you know some featurewe did that that that kind of broke thetests again uh and my manager said youknow something like oh well you know youjust don't have to fix them and I was somad I was so angry I I I left themeeting I think I actually left themeeting Midway which I've never donebefore or since I just got up and leftand I went into another room I went thiswas in the office I went into anotheroffice um and I uh I updated myreime that was what I did was was thisfeeling of like like engineering craftis not like I don't know the number oneor or what was it it just once againstlike your core beliefs that that time Ithink I had just put in so much workthat honestly a lot of it was like asunk cost thing I I felt that it had tobe important because I'd spent so muchtime on it in hindsight um I did thinklike it sort of offended mysensibilities to have tests that wereconstantly failing that felt that feltbad as an engineer uh yeah I was I wasso madum and then I think a couple of dayslater like I when I recovered when Ikind of felt good again it it it sort oflike instilled in me this sense that youcan care a lot about something and youcan have good engineering reasons forcaring about it and the company mightnot care at all and if you're in thatposition that's your fault that's notthe company's fault you either haveto deal with that and like accept thatyou're not going to get rewards fordoing this work that you're doing andnot expect them or you need to likereprioritize so you're more in line withwhat the company wants that that that'ssort of what I took from that experienceum and it took a couple more instancesuh of me being invested in things andand kind of you know suffering thismisalignment between what I wanted andwhat the company wanted but that wasdefinitely like the first kind ofimpulse and I I think I was a mid-levelengineer at that point I don't think Iwas even senior but that started likethe pathway for me to be thinking aboutthese things in the way I do today buthow did your reconcile this right cuzlike I can feel your frustration on awhy you know if you a test Suite likewhy I have a test Suite which is notgreen all the time Etc but in and howdid you come to understand why either itwas not important or not as important asyou thought like for for for thesestaging tests specifically or or whatwas important what what did the companycare about that maybe you missed at thetime I think I made the mistake that alot of more Junior engineers make ofseeing something written down as like aprocedure or a rule and assuming that itwas true so I I had thought that likethis social fact that you couldn'tdeploy with red tests so we had to getthe test green every time we deployedwhich was a lot of work I thought thatwas like an immutable fact and thensometime after I got knocked back fromthis and I stopped maintaining the testsand they were R more often of the timeuh we had this critical deployment thathad to go out and the tests were red thetests weren't green um and I remember wewere just like oh whatever we'llmanually test the red cases we don'tactually need to get the sweet passingwe'll just deploy the code and I waslike oh yeah when the company needs codeto go out the company will find a way toget that code out and these like rulesthat are in place to like keep codequality up andstuff those aren't hard rules those arelike soft rules those are rules thatwill bend uh if the company has like aclear and present need to get somethingdone aroundI think that that was kind of like thatwas the end of of of me worrying toomuch about about those tests I thinkyeah and I I assume like I'm just goingto assume that these tests were moreflaky and they were more less reliablecloser to end test which end testingSuites are always a huge headache forevery single company that does them andyou know there's yeah I always seecompanies investing a lot and thenscaling back and all those things sothere there's also that part right we'renot talking about like unit sess or Tthat that that signal if they breakthere's 100% chance of regression orlike 99% chance of regression no n totest operating on a a small set ofaccounts such that one test could changethe state of the account and fail asubsequent test uh Ruby test cppy barand selenium for anyone listening who'sin a similar painfulsituation so jumping back to shippingprojects and in in production in yourexperience what are things that get intothe way of shipping to productionemphasis being both on shipping and andproduction yeah I mean this is anotheranother list of of of things we could gothrough for the rest of thepodcast because uh successful projectsthere's a narrow path to success andthere's a million paths to failure in myexperience projects narrow path tosuccess yeah projects want to fail likethe default state of a project is tofail like projects only succeed becausepeople drag them Kicking and Screamingto the Finish Line If you leave aproject alone and nobody's worryingabout whether it's going to ship n timesout of 10 that project will not ship umso yeah many many things uh to getconcrete um one like common category ofthings is that it's some detail nobodythought of so just to do a rapid fire oflike examples uh from my experience heywe got to like a week before ship and werealized we've forgotten to do thesecurity review or we've gotten to likebefore ship and we we thought teamx wasgoing to build this thing but actuallythey they thought we were going to buildthis thing and this thing doesn't existor we were relying on this service butthis service is actually you know inbeta it's not actually deployed yet youknow it's slated to go out Q2 next yearsorry or hey this service is inproduction but um you want to run uh ath000 requests a second through it andit can only support 10 it's just notdesigned for your stuff so it's justendless endless endless like you'recoordinating with some other team andthere's a understanding about who'sdelivering what and in big companieslike projects need to go outwith some on the order of like five to25 teams coordinating sometimes likethere's a lot of cooks that go into likeshipping anything in a large company andit only takes like two of them to to bereally badly misaligned to sync thewholeproject so one thing I I've observed atcompanies like this where it is reallycomplex to ship as you said 5 to 25 uhteams collaborating together which is alot but again if you worked at theselarger um companies the ones that thatdo you have or similar size it it doeshappen but there are two ways I I'veseen people respond to this who are techleads specifically one type of tech leadgoes like you know puts up their handlike look this is like too much for oneperson to do uh our TPM was not on ontop of it technical program manager whotypically coordinated it's like it's notmy fault right like you know what can Ido and then there there's also the thetees who who like you know who don'thave this response and and they actuallyone way or the other go through it butwhat is your take on this cuz when youdo have such complexity it can feel likea full-time job of just coordinating andyou know there there is some push backthat I hear from Engineers uh warrantedor not saying like look this is notsoftware engineering this is projectmanagement and my main job is softwareengineering I would need someone else todo it uh how when you were in thissituation what was your uh kind ofresponse and also especially keeping themind that you do want to shipping at theend of the day I think there's twocoordination tasks that you're sort oftalking about there and they can luckilythey can be done in parallel or I don'tthink anything would ship at bigcompanies no matter what there the taskof making sure every team is likeactively working on the project andcoordinating like in communication andagreeing that they're going to ship by acertain date that's what I see as morethe uh the TPM or program manager roleof coordination uh but there's also inparallel I think a purely technicalsense in which these teams have tocoordinate and maybe you've worked withdifferent TPMS than I have but in myexperience you need uh an actualengineer on the team who is a afull-time engineer usually a senior orstaff engineer to have the entiretechnical structure of the project intheir head in order for for something toship and this is something I said in theblog post and this is something thatactually was not controversial everyoneseemed to agree which is the projectship because one single person has thetechnical context in their head theydon't ship because like teams agree andmanage to coordinate teams agree andcoordinate because one person amongthose teams has the has the whole flowin their head and is able to kind ofanticipate problems and answer answerquestions because of it and I think alot of companies kind of formalized thatinto having a a drri engineer as well asa TPM and as well as all these otherthings um there's a single engineerthat's that's that's responsible forlike the technical success of a projectand and that's that's the person I'mtalking to when I write my blog post uhbecause that's the that's the positionI've been in a lot of times and sort ofyou learn you learn hard lessons youknow and drri being directly responsibleindividual yeah that's right sorrydirectly responsible individual that'swhat it stands for so I I I like howyou're you're phrasing this but is it amI understanding it correctly that you'resaying that if you're the tech lead on aproject or you're an engineer on on yourproject aiming to be this operating atthe staff plus level level regardless ofyour title like you're like okay I Iwant to know what's going on then it isyour job to understand the whole projectunderstand your team's work how it tieswith everything else and understand allthe parts how it can go wrong and youknow make sure that these are addressedat least and then if that's done you'repart of the project should be fine youknow there's a lot of coordinationcommunication that you cannot controlbut you can control making sure do Ihave this whole thing in my headunderstanding it and having Clarity andyou know like feeling good about it isthat roughly yeah that's right that'sthat I think is what I'm saying thequestion of whether it's your job is aninteresting one I don't actually knowlike if people typically do this workbecause it's their job I think theytypically do this work because they careabout the project succeeding and theyrecognize that it's not going to succeedunless somebody steps up and kind ofthinks through uh the whole thing end toend but whether it's your job or notif you are in this position of shippingthese projects it can feel likethankless work but in my experience itis really not thankless work people donotice and people do talk about it andyour name will come up eventually assomebody who can be relied on which willlead you to getting more impactful workwhich will lead you to promo packets andso on at least that's what's uh I'vebeen I've been lucky enough that that'shappened to me so I think whether it'syour job or not you know it can sort ofbe like perform for the job you wantright not the job you have maybe like II I'm going to plus one that having beena manager on my on my team Ialways remembered people whohelp either they bring up they bring uprisk that are on projects but they alsobring Solutions saying oh here's therisk here's what I think I should do andwhen they do it enough times I'm likeokay this person they're actually reallygood at whatever they're doing whatevertheir their level is and the lower thelevel right the more ammunition that isfor the next promotion and also on on uhcalibration meetings for promotions oror performance reviews it was a verypowerful argument when an injury managerbrought up well this person they theyare drisking the project the projectshipped on time because of them becausethey stepped in even though it wasn'ttheir job so it does take I think awhile to to catch up but uh managers areare usually they they want to boastabout their direct reports at all theseoccasions which is invisible toengineers I I I I agree with you it'shard to go wrong with this so so talkingabout te kind of Technology skills orhard skills versus soft skills orpolitics a lot of what we talked aboutshipping to production seemed like it'sa bit of a soft skill understand thebusiness know the priorities you knowmake your management chain happy and andthese things but how do you think thetechnology skills fit into to shippingyou mentioned they're important but butcan you give examples on how importantthey are or or you know what what comesfirst right cuz there's I'm trying tofigure out if if if in your opinion oryourexperience is one of them more importantthan the other I wrote a lot aboutpolitical skill because I thinkEngineers typically understand that it'simportant to be technically strong andthey typically don't understand thatit's important to kind of be alignedwith the with the politics that's why myfocus was there but yeah if I had topick one I would say the technicalskills are more important shippingprojectslike shipping projects only succeedslike you can only ship a project whenyou understand it end to end and ittakes a lot of technical skill to beable to understand a project end to endand to be able to Pivot and to be ableto answer questions that come in fromvarious angles um and and one thing thatI didn't write about a lot but I thinkis really underrated is speed inshipping projects not just speed ofimplementation but speed of reactionspeed of uh communication when whensomething comes in out of left field youneed to have contingency plans likeright away you need to be communicatingit right away when there's a blocker youneed to be addressing it right awaybecause all these things add up likebecause there's so many things that cankill a project like the one like youknow grand theme that can kill a projectis being too slow because if you take anextra week or an extra two weeks that'san extra two weeks that something canhappen you really need to seize youropportunities and try and ship asquickly as possible uh sort of beforeanything can go can go too badly wrongand you just don't have like theow to dothat um without enough technical skillto kind of you know be able to like saythrow it end to end which is a lot yeahand reflecting on this I'm just thinkingback of the best tech leads I rememberespecially when I was a manager on myteam and you know they weren't the oneswho so whenever a I think you sol withthe problem oh here's a problem thisteam says they need another like twoweeks to build this stuff the tech leadthat was kind of okay was like okay okayuh let me talk to them see if we can youknow get it down to week and a half or aweek if we can rep prioritize theawesome Tech lead was like why what whatis keeping them up let me I just lookedat your code base and I don't really seea reason I actually talked with theirengineer and they said like they justneed this like small ticket done uh I'mI already I already wrote the diff it'sit's ready for to line for them we'llwe'll get unblock yourself for tomorrowand like it's this as as you said theperson with the technical skill who canactually go there and understand andChallenge and also sometimes especiallyif you're working at a company which hasa internal open source policy meaningyou can make changes to their code baselike yeah just just make the change andthen theteam it's it's it's it's incredible howtechnical strong technical skill withthe ability of getting things done canreally just movethings You observe similar things yeahno i' I've seen that too I've seen thatso often umone thing I've seen is like the abilityto kind of come up with a technical demokind of moving mountains like one demoof like hey look at this thing happeningcan cut through uh weeks of conversationabout whether it's possible and if youjust go off and produce that you canreally kind of blow people out of thewater uh one thing I say a lot is thatin in the context of like a largecompany which which of necessity hasmany non-technical managers andnon-technical stakeholders beingtechnically strong if you work onsoftware is really a superpower becauseit makes you connected to reality itmakes you connected to kind of the realworld to the actual product that you'rebuilding uh and it's sort of like a lotof the work these other people are doingum about around strategy and marketingand figuring out what needs to be builtuh that only like that's a hugemultipler on like a tech company but itonly kind of starts multiplying when itlocks into somebody with the technicalskill to actually make it happen so ifyou're that person just by like having alot of technical surface area you canlike unlock the the sort ofmultiplicative factor of like all theseother people in your organization justby being willing to to answer technicalquestions to make technical demos and toimplement things uh quickly that arebothering them that they think areimportant like you you can really movean an organization just by beingtechnically strong if you're willing toput that technical strength in theservice of of of people who have likethought hard about what needs doing butdon't have the technical skill to do itand I I see a lot of people who who areso technically strong but are pouringthat technical strength into like makingthe code a little bit cleaner or orwriting tests that are a little betterand that can be really useful but Ithink you could be doing so much morecan we Zone in on to to this specificthing because I hear what you're sayingis if you are technically strong and youcan Surface in a in a way that is a lotmore helpful to the business visible toothers but what I'm seeing seeing as alot of most software Engineers aretechnically strong and as you say theymight be pouring it into less visiblethings what what might be some ways thatI can you know like like surface this alittle bit more I think the mostimpactful piece of advice I can give isjust to go out and talk to people um andthat's a little spicy sometimes becausegoing out and talking to people uh sortof circumvents some of the process thatthese large tech companies have in placeby which like communication goes throughfrom Project managers to designers toEngineers but if you're an engineer andyou you have a lot of horsepower andyou're looking for a place to apply itand you feel like the the backlog onyour team is not the most impactfulplace uh Sometimes the best thing youcan do is to go and talk to your skiplevel go and talk to your projectmanager your product manager yourdesigner and just say what like what doyou think needs doing what do you thinkuh like I can work on one thing that I Ido see Engineers do this and and this ismaybe not the most like politicallySavvy way to use their superpower butone way have seen Engineers use thissuperpower is to go to support to the totheir support counterparts who who raisetickets and to kind of invest thathorsepower into making things better forsupport fixing bugs that like waste timefor support this is not the kind of workthat I think is is is going to be superimpactful on a Premo packet um but it isworth doing um and I think a lot ofEngineers who already do that forsupport could be pretty well served bytaking that and also doing it for designand and and product instead of waitingfor the these design and product plansto to percolate through to to epics toissues to scoping because a lot of thetime there there are quick wins that youcan just knock out quickly um but I likethis it might make your manager umunhappy and it it might it might not bea sensible move depending on the climateof your of your team to kind of goaround the process like that yeah I I Ilike this but I I I do think that ifyou're unable to go to customer supportand fix a persistent issueyou know like on the side at all likeover a year or two years then like it isa good question of like how effectivecan you be like I've actually noticedthat some of the the most effective Techleades did do not on a regular basis butevery now or they were able to do thisso yeah I I guess if if if you'retrapped and looking for inspiration thiscould be one way to try and also justfigure out like what the response isright if your leadership team is like ohyou should have not done that like welldo you really want to be work be workingthere when you're like fixing doingsomething delightful on top of the jobthat you have is uh is taken like thatprobably not again it depends on theexternal climate and all that but uh itcan be I I like the suggestion I I thinkit's worth trying to understand why ifyour leadership team comes back and saysyou should not be doing that cuz yeahmaybe they're wrong but maybe they'reright maybe there's some likeexistential problem facing the companythat you ought to be working on insteadlike a lot of the time like Engineerscan spin their wheelslike it doesn't matter like a a problemaffec in the company can be as seriousas it gets and there can still beEngineers spinning their wheels becausethat that team structure doesn't ow themto act I've seen thathappen yeah it's it's a good question onwho's who is it down to obviously as anengineer especially when you're seniorabove you should understand that butalso if if if you're not as experiencedand the management team or your manageris not efficient in telling you likethis is really important the the thecompany is on the line or our product ison the line well yeah that's a littlebit on them as well that's true speakingof trust with your leadership team as atech lead it's really important that youyou do have trust with your leadershipteam and this sounds pretty vague uh butit is important what are good waysyou've seen of doing this yeah so by farthe best way to like main TR maintaintrust with your leadership team is toship is to deliver and is to deliverconsistently so if you're that engineerwe talked about earlier who's likesaving projects and drisking projectsand making sure things get across theline that builds trust um at minimum itit it builds trust uh in in leadershipthat you're technically strong you knowlike and and that goes a long way thatthat gets you put on higher profileprojects that gets you kind of called inwhen something's important and and kindof starts this like snowball umbut in order to do that in order to shipon things that like your management teamcares about uh I think you do have tolike maintain the capacity to do that sowhat I what I mean by that is if ifyou're at 120% on your team's jurtickets and you're just burning down andburning down and burning down um you'renot going to have the capacity you needwhen something comes in that that ismore visible and is more kind of higherhigher profile so I do think if you wantto like maintain this trust with yourleadership team one big part of that isis is to kind of keep your regularworking Cadence at like closer to 80% or60% and then kick it up to 120 130 uhwhen something does come across and thatway you can kind of save your powder forwhen you for when you really need it umI think that's really important uh theother thing is is is to try andcommunicate like them so I think a lotof Engineers kind of get this sense thatthat talking uh like Senior Managementis is this kind of slimy thing is thislike non- likee engineering value likeyou're not a you're not a hacker if youuse words like Circle back or orsynergize um I think yeah maybe that'strue but if you want to build trust withyour management like you need to kind ofplay the game a little bit and you needto like learn how they communicate umand and sort of communicate back to thema little bit like that uh just to makethat really concrete um if you'reshipping a project the most importantthing almost like more important thantechnically delivering is understandingwhat the project is for so uh a projectcan be for um box ticking for an auditit can be for attracting new users itcan be for extracting more money fromexisting users uh it can be forsatisfying some VP or CEO's like dreamof what a future product could bethere's so many reasons and all of thosemean you have to work differently youknow products for new users have to bereally polished products for like largeEnterprise users don't have to bepolished at all but the requirements areusually really inflexible stuff likethat but you have to know what the whatthe project is for but management won'ttell you that unless you can communicateuh in a way that they know how tocommunicate back to so if you to yourmanager and you say hey can I build areally crappy UI for this that isterrible to use every single manager inthe world particularly in writing isgoing to say no of course not you haveto build something really nice umbecause they're afraid that you're goingto go and build something awful and thenpoint at them and say hey they told meto do it like you know so you you reallydo have to like to pick up this likecrucial information you have to be ableto communicate this like you know is itokay to make trade-offs with userexperience instead of saying is it okayto build a crappy UI like you have to beable to talk to talk like that I it's ahard lesson for some Engineers to learnI think but it's it's reallyimportant yeah this is very interestingbecause it triggers memories for mewhere I was the tech lead on a projectwhich it it didn't make sense for us tobuild it and I talked with my productmanager and you know she she confirmedlike no it it doesn't make sense in factlike we're only doing this becausethere's an executive who struck somesort of deal with this company we neededto integrate something something and shesaid like look like it makes no businesssense try to talk them out of it we gotdetails but it came down to somethingpolitical honestly that they they theywere saying oh we have a deal with thiscompany we cannot not do it Etc so itbecame a little bit ego and she saidlike look here's what's going to happenwe need to build it there's no way outof it we need to do it as fast as we canuh we're going to retire it in a year uhwe're going to have very very few usersof this thing relatively so and she thePM wasn't telling me she's like justthese are the constraints so as a techlead I kind of turned to the team andtold them like look here's the deal weneed to build this it we can do itquickly we can skip some of the the testit kind of needs to borderline work butwe don't need to pour much complexityand this was a complex project so in theend actually helped us deprioritize alot of the edge cases it was like don'tcare just add an error message don't dothis and and in the end actually whathappened is we shipped it we had like aridiculously low number of users as wepredicted and and we retired it in 12months later the code was deleted and itone on one end it was one this boxscking exercise which didn't make sensebut we had to do it and the shorter wedid it the better it was it was thefirst time I I realized that you coulddo stuff that doesn't really make sensebut it was a necessity and we could haveargued a lot more uh or dragged our feetabout it but in the end we're like youknow what let's do it quickly ship it uhthumbs up I'm really impressed by thethe the trust relationship that you hadwith your team and and with your productmanager that you could just be upfrontabout it and say hey we're we're doingthis to check a box we can trade offuser experience no problem like that'ssounds like it made things easier it itmade that this was a rarely like it wasa really like close relationship withthe the product manager we were likereally kind of one unit it also helpedthat we were in a different officelocation from HQ I'm not sure if at HQit it would have been said this clearlybecause then people talk and you don'treally you know I think it kind ofundermines you know like leadershipmorale when you say like basically theleadership like we don't agree withleadership and we're right to do so andactually the the data showed that we'reright to do so but either way so onething that is changing softwareengineering a lot is Gen AI uh it's it'snow in a day-to-day tool chain you'reclearly you're working on some toolsthat I know you cannot talk about uh atat GitHub but a lot of softwareEngineers are using tools like GitHubCil or or some competitors to make theirtheir workeasier but I I'm wondering becauseyou're working on both this toolingyou're using it you're also seeing whatdevelopers use what parts of thesoftware engineering job do you thinkare becoming easier with genitools specifically with with gettingthings done right yeah um well one thingI I said earlier was that the the sortof cardinal virtue of of of shippingprojects is is speed is getting thingsdone quickly because so many things cango wrong when you when you delay uh andand one thing gen is really good at isspeed it's it's it's getting you like80% of the way and it's getting you likevolume kind of for free um and one likeI'm a huge believer in like gen forprogramming I I use it every day I useit all the time um I use GitHub co-pilotI I I chat to co-pilot in the editorlike when I'm on personal projects I Iuse chat GPT and it's justthe level with which you can like gofrom zero to something is is so gooduh I do think like it's the kind ofthing where I think Engineers that tendto work on one code base and tend to notwork across a sort of broad spectrum cansort of underrate how powerful it isbecause it's it's it's not going to bebetter than you at writing like Ruby andRuby on Rails in the codebase thatyou've worked on for 5 years you'regoing to be better at it than that surebut it will be better at you probably atworking on like goang in your company'sload balance or repo that you haven'ttouched and are unfamiliar with likeit'll be better at you like in all thesedomains where where you don't haveexperience and because so much ofshipping projects requires likeunderstanding code and writing usuallysmall bits of code in in repos thatyou're not familiar with I think likegen can kind of be this real DifferenceMaker there where it can you know youneed to build like a page in yourcompany's internal admin tool in orderto ship afeature that probably doesn't have to besuper polished that probably doesn'thave to be like you know 100% there jican probably do most of that for you youknow that's that's the kind of thingwhere like you can save a day or two umand that kind of compounds over thecourse of of a of a project so uh we hadSimon Wilson on on the podcast who issoftware engineer who's using a lot ofgeni and one interesting thing he saidthat gen AI makes him a lot moreambitious sois it fair to say that with geni if youhave it at at your workplace which mostcompanies will have at this point as asoftware engineer you can just be moreambitious and do you know either sign upor start doing these projects or justcontribute to project which you knowbefore these tooling you might have beenlike n too much time I'm not going to beable to get my head around it it's acodebase that I I've never touched I'venever programmed this let me just leaveit alone I I personally haven't noticedthis huge increase in ambition at workuh just because like typically thehardest parts of like complicatedsoftware that has to be correct thehardest part is is is that extra 20% uhon top of what AI can give you so I Iwould be reluctant I think to kind ofswan into to let's say the load balancerlike github's load balancer and say Heyyou know me and co-pilot like built thisbuilt this feature that I think isreally cool like you know like Iwouldn't expect a super positiveresponse where I have found like thechat GPT or like gen lets me be moreambitious uh is is personal projects forsure when I'm working on like stuff bymyself or learning stuff by myself Ialmost feel like I can learn anything Ialmost feel like I can I can get intoany area uh like so much quicker thanbefore just because the ability to askquestions of of um of co-pilot of chatPT the ability to like just ask endlessquestions of of someone that never getstired of the questions that always givesyou like considered answers that'sthat's sort of the dream right whenyou're when you're learning somethingnew so I I love it for that kind of workand I love it for like prototyping andspiking things out and you know I satdown the other weekend and I was likewhat would it look like if you had fivemodels playing Texas holdom against eachother who would win um and I you knowunder a day I had that I had thatworking andI turns out it's GPT 4like it's just uh it's just notsomething I would have done I wouldn'tyou know building a a a Texas hold andpoker like simulator to like back thisback this app it's just you know I don'tthink I would have bothered doing itbecause it would have taken you knowmultiple days it would have taken a lotof effortbut with llms you know I just kind ofhad it up in half an hour was great andthis is a little different question butrelated to this do you see parts ofsoftware engine that are gettingactually harder as a result of more genAI being used more people using gen a oror or just because of these toolsthemselvesuh yeah I mean I'm I'm in a great spotto talk about this as somebody who'sworked on co-pilot and is working onGitHub models one part of softwareengineering that's getting harder isbuilding these gen tools which isincreasingly becoming a large part ofsoftware engineering uh llms are reallyhard to make into into working softwareuh the text text modality is hard towork with hallucinations is hard to workwith the fact that it's all moving sofast it's a really fun area but man isit more difficult than um than than thanthe work I was doing before like on onso many different levels like even justthe fact that many people you work withare kind of struggling to keep up aswell you just don't have this kind ofBaseline level of understanding that Idid say at sendes when I was working onapps and we'd had apps for years andeveryone had been working on App Storesfor years everyone knew what an appstore was now I'm at you know GitHubworking on llms and people are kind oflearning as we go like what are evalswhat are what are logits what does itmean to put like a a grammar enforcer infront of the sampler when you're whenwhen you're like you know enforcing thisJson schema how does that work like somany so many things the learning curveis just is just so steep so that'sdefinitely getting harder if youactually have to like build this buildthese tools man yeah that's harder thanthan than standard kind of engineeringcrud work well and I guess more and moreof this over time I would think it wouldleak over into software engine the sensethat these days if you're a backendengineer you're kind of expected tounderstand how like the front end worksat a conceptual level you know if needbe okay like you're probably not yourjob but like every now and then youshould be able to touch a little withCSS or HTML same way I I would expectyou know like the term full stackengineering is exploding for good reasonand I would assume that in a few yearssoftware Engineers understanding thingslike you know what is a rack pipeline orwhat does it mean to train a modelversus to fine-tune it again youprobably don't need to do it but justknowing some of these and and increasingmore Concepts will just be part of theday-to-day job especially as morecompanies you know like incorporate llmsinto their different projects yeah forsure uh assuming we still have ragpipelines assuming we still have finetuning like I think some of those thingsare definitely still up in the air Imean even two days ago open AI releaseda new a new way of fine tuning modelsthat isn't low rank adaptation so whoknows where it's going to go EX exactlywell it's an exciting space yeah sure isuh another area that is very challengingand interesting is working across timezones you you're doing this you'reyou're based in Australia so uh I'massuming you work with teams who are invastly different time zones what is yourexperience uhworking with teams who are in differenttime zones what what works well and whatdoesn't yeah um well one thing I I dowant to say just on the the topic of mebeing based in Australia is uh a lot ofpeople got angry about about my postabout shipping and and and said that youknow they're going to plant their feetand be really disagreeable and telltheir manager to screw off and and anddo whatever I got to say that thecalculus on that looks a littledifferent when you're an Australianengineer and you don't live in SanFrancisco and you don't have you know20,000 jobs that you can walk to fromyour from your front door so I think onething about being in a different timezone is is is I think you sort of don'thave this uhthere are some areas in which yourexperience is is not like your us peerswhich which definitely affects how youwork and maybe makes you a bit moreprone to kind of do what the companyneeds as opposed to planning your feetum but in terms of my my directexperience working across time zones aszendesk I I sort of worked with liketeams in different time zones but myteam was kind of collocated which wasnice and then I had a bit of a routeAwakening at GitHub I was hired as thefirst Australian engineer uh on my teamyeah just me uh with with the goal tokind of grow this APAC group uh but Ithink 2 weeks after I was hired uh therewas a hiring phrase um as there weremany hiring phrases around that time andso for for 9 months uh it was like fiveus engineers and a US manager and me inAPAC doing doing my doing my ape thingand and that was a that was a veryinteresting experience um it was ait was a very lonely experience in someways but but there were there were realupsides that I think kind of hard toanticipate if you haven't been in thatposition one of them is that like mymornings were really busy becauseeverybody was like closing up their dayand I had to catch up on everything thathad happened but my afternoons werealmost allclear so I was in this position wherelike every afternoon I could do deepwork and I think that really set me upuh for successI I do think like I'm a pretty highagency engineerum and GitHub was lucky uh that it gotsomebody like me who is happy maybe witha little bit less support I I do thinklike being the solo engineer for ninemonths in a different time zonelike not foreverybodyyso now having seen you know like bothcollocated teams workingwith with with different times is alsoyou working by yourself when it comes toremote worklike talking to engineering managers orpeople who are organizing this like whatis the strategy that you've actuallyseen work the best and and and mostefficient am I incorrect to assume thatit's going to be the collocated teamswhere there there's multiplepeople yeah definitely uh definitelydon't just hire one person in a timezone if if you if you can right now wehave like a sort of squad of of APACtime zone engineers and a squad of usengineers and I think that works well umone thing I think that's reallyimportant for for managers kind oftrying to do this and I recommend allmanagers do this uh I think every uscompany should open many hiring RS inAustralia please that would make me veryhappy but one one thing that I think isis is a really good benefit of thisapproach and something we've done at atGitHub the whole time I've been there isto sort of double down on the ability tohave people working uh follow the sun 2424/7 so many many many times when we'vehad critical projects or like criticalbugs we've had the US Squad do a bunchof work and then hand off to the ApexSquad and then the Apex Squad hands offto the US Squad and the result is thatlike it sounds like a silver bullet uhbut you can basically twox the speed umwhen you're when you're delivering somethings things that where the the handoffcost is is pretty minimal like like buginvestigations that kind of thing andwe've we've really been able todeliver I think some projects that wejust could not have delivered if we'vebeen restricted to working in the UStime zone only um users as well when auser reports a bug in the afternoon andthey go to sleep and they wake up andit's fixed that feels really good andthat's that's harder to do uh with naEngineers they kind of have to workreally late for that to happen but wesort of got that for free like anytimean important bug came in just got givento the APAC engineers and if we wereable to solve it by the end of the dayit was just this really good userexperience of like wow they likeliterally fix it overnight like I I wakeup and it works that's that's amazing umI do think one way in which GitHub isreally well set up for this kind of workis that it's very async first and that'ssuper important for like managing thesethese two kind of time zones because youcan't all be in meetings you need to beproducing kind of written artifacts anddemos these sort of things that can likespeak for you and and and do work whileyou're asleep um so definitely likeuh you need to kind of hire people whoare comfortable both writing and readingum documents and and and demos and thatkind of thing I think that readingpart's important I think it'scomparatively easy to hire people whoare happy to write demo to to like writememos and write rfc's I think it'sslightly harder to find people who arehappy to read rfc's but that's that'salmost more important on these um onthese on these distributed teams likepeople need to be communicating asyncfor it towork and you're now in a I think of anincreasingly enviable position in thesense that you are working full remoteat a at a team and a company that doessupport full remote and we're seeingdata that the percentage of these uh jobuh options is unfortunately just goingdown a bit who knows if if it'llstabilize or or go up in the future butright now it is going down so and andthe the willingness of Engineers wantingto do that is is not going down so I I'dlike to ask in your experience what arethe practices and the traits that helpyou excel in a full remote environmentand what what do you think you needed touh to actually do this because as yousaid you know you worked for nine monthsby yourself and you mentioned that it'snot for for everyoneyeah Imean to sort of sound like I see somepeople talk on Twitter these days I Ithink part of it is that I'm builtdifferent um and I mean that in in inlike a maybe youknow uh not necessarily entirelypositive way but like some people Ithink need human interaction need to belike talking with people they work withuh whether it's on Zoom or not I think Ican go a long time communicating withpeople iyn that's just kind of how I'mput together which makes it a reallygood fit for me uh sort of first andforemost that's that's sort of how I'velike because I I know a lot of goodEngineers who I think could excel inthis in this role kind of flame outbecause they can't stand being bythemselves and that's just not somethingthat's that's that's that's bothered meso I've kind of had that obstacle likeremoved which is which is which isreally nice um of course then you stillhave to excel uh and I think you knowwhat I focused on what I've done wellyou know we've we've talked about it youcan go and read the blog post like butthe the one sentence is youknow if you're in this enviable positionand you want to keep it you kind of haveto align with what the company needsfrom you and you have to take what yourjob is really seriously um I see a lotof Engineers who like have their owngoals uh for how they want to work youknow they they want to have all theircode perfectly clean or they want toalways have unit tests or they want towork on like front end stuff only um andthey sort of push those goals up againstthe company's goals and that's fine youcan you can do that and you can makethose those decisions um but if you'rein a spot that you really want to keepuh like working fully remote for acompany like GitHub that I love you knowI have a lot of reason to try and kindof absorb the company's goals and andand and to try and make them my own andI I think that's broadly been successfuland has has kind of put me in thisposition where like I'm able to keepdoing this and hopefully I can keepdoing this for some time to come I I I Ilike this reflection especially on thepartof you can go a long time withoutcommunicating async I guess a lot ofthis will just be learning but is it isit safe to say that did you know what itwould be like to work proper full remotebefore you did it or or was it like justyou know something that you needed to gothrough to see because as as Iunderstand at zendesk it was more in inoffice and and together with the squadand this was the first time where it wasa proper formal job for you well recallrecall the timing right like I I I movedto GitHub in 2021 um and uh AustraliaMelbourne had had one of the uh one ofthe longest one of the most extremelockdowns uh in the world so for adecent amount of time before I moved tozendesk I'd been working like relocatedin a time zone with people but I'd beenworking from my house I I hadn't beenworking from the office I hadn't seenthese people so I think that was prettyunpleasant in a lot of ways but inhindsight it did kind of give me theconfidence that like I could do thisremote rle at a company like GitHub andthat I could kind of I sort of knew thatI could work without going into theoffice and before I I wasn't so sure howI would cope with that turns out I copereally well but I don't know if you cananticipate that ahead of time you kindof have to try it and see on the flipside a lot of us who have workedthroughout 2020 2021 have likely hadthat experience and I think people goingto reflect on like how did it feel likecould you do this for longer uh did youactually Thrive because some peoplethrive some people hatedit yeah for sure I I do think it wasvery different being like in the sametime zone as people from being alone inmy time zone that that was a big shiftthat was something that I I think I gotI got lucky that the that I ended upbeing a good a good fit for that becausehad I known that was going to be thecase I I might have been a bit moreskittish about about taking the role Iprobably still would have done it ohyeah well some things you just got towing it and sounds like that's whatyou've did let's close up with somerapid questions so I'll I'll just ask aquestion and just like bird out whateveruh it comes first to mind what's aninteresting framework or Library you'verecently used and what did you likeaboutit um I mean this is a silly answer butRuby on Rails man I I love Ruby on Railsit's not new it's not sexy um but I I ama huge Ruby on Rails believer um andit's just it's the most programmerfriendly way to build large web apps uhand its flaws are honestly ining to meis GitHub still using rupon rails Iheard that it was started off ruponrails or it migrates to rupon rail so sointernally it's being used or this isjust used on the side oh no no G GitHubis still like in very large part stillstill a ruby on rail shop we run a lotof different things for a lot ofdifferent Services you know sometimesRuby on rail doesn't make sense but ifyou go to GitHub and you go throughgithub.com and you interact on GitHubalmost every single thing you do isgoing through Ru on ra still that's agood fun fact reminder yeah uh what is abook that you would recommend uh and whyum well one Tech book is actuallyunderneath my mic right now it's thelittle book of uhlearning byum by by Francefur which which was sort of something Ipicked up when I was getting into llmsand I wanted to have a bit of a betterunderstanding of like uh the the sort ofmaths that was that was backing them umand it was just a really nice like shortprer on on on how it worked didn't gointo too much detail it was it wasexcellent um but to recommend a bookthat I like I read every year I I got ashout out the name of the Rose byAlberto Eko uh I read it every year it'san incredible book um about an ItalianMonastery in the 1300s where somebodycommits a murder and then they have todo an investigation I think it's a veryfunny book but it's a book about peopledoing their best in complicated systemswhich which kind of speaks to me andmaybe some of the things we've talkedabout so yeah name of the Rose byUmberto EO go read it well thank youvery much for sharing all these detailsand being on the podcast no problem

    "summary": "The YouTube video featuring Sean Goedecke, a Staff Engineer at GitHub, delves into the complexities of \"shipping\" projects at large tech companies. Goedecke emphasizes that shipping, in this context, is a socially constructed concept defined by management's perception and approval, not just code deployment. He argues that technical skills are crucial for understanding a project end-to-end and reacting quickly to unforeseen issues, but political acumen is also essential for aligning with company goals and communicating effectively with non-technical stakeholders. A key insight is that projects are prone to failure without proactive effort, requiring individuals to take ownership and address potential roadblocks.\n\nGoedecke also discusses the impact of GenAI on software engineering. While it enhances speed and efficiency, especially for unfamiliar codebases, he cautions against overconfidence and stresses the importance of maintaining technical depth and adaptability. He shares his experience working remotely from Australia, highlighting the benefits of \"follow the sun\" 24/7 operations but also acknowledging the potential for loneliness and the need for strong communication skills in distributed teams. Ultimately, Goedecke underscores the value of aligning individual goals with company objectives, demonstrating initiative, and building trust with leadership to succeed in a full-remote environment."

    "transcript": "so item poent is one of the mostcritical things to consider whiledesigning an API or a microservice inthis video I'll walk you through whatitem poent is why do we needed and moreimportantly take a look at an approachof implementing item butons there aremultiple ways of doing it I've in thisvideo I've talked about one good commonapproach of implementing em buttons butobviously it is very subjective and itdepends on the problem statement thatyou have but this will solidify yourunderstanding on on on how to implementem po in general right so what exactlyis an emance to put it very simply it'slike exe like you say that your APIendpoint or your service is ID poentwhen if you execute the sameoperation multiple times the result ofmultiple execution of that operation issame as as if that operation was runjust once to put it very simply onInstagram when you're scrolling food youlike the you you you like the photo soyou double tapped it as soon as youdouble tapped it the like countincreases by one now no matter how manytimes you double tap it no matter howmany times the backend API call goes thelike count doesn't change this isexactly what it means when we say thatAPI is adom poent no matter if that APIis called 1 time 100 * 1,000 times theresultant outcome of that API is alwaysgoing to be your count overall increasejust by one rightthis although this is a very crudeexample of looking at it Things becomevery serious when money is involvedlet's say you let's say we build a banklet's say we build a payment service inwhich your user a wants to pay user B$22,000 right so then there must be anAPI on which you invoke this/ pay /b/20,000 which then which then does thetransaction between the two user rightnow here what we defitely do not want isif this API invoke twice like if if dueto retry due to anything if we invokethis API twice we don't want the amountto be deducted twice from A's accountand get credited into B'saccount right so this becomes verycritical that because like to ensurethat no bug can let this transactionhappen twice right so here what we needis we need item pance right so otherplaces where this is extremely relevantis user to not tweet the same tweetagain like for example on Twitter yousee this tweet button you type somethingand let's say instead of clicking youdouble clicked it this would have firedtwo API calls in the back end we don'twant that to happen one time only onetweet goes and while the other doesn'thappen right we want to make that thingitem puted how can we do that likethat's exactly what what we'll bediscussing not placing the same ordertwice on Amazon on Amazon once you addto the cart you say place order ifhypothetically let's say your Amazon payhas enough balance to support two ordersyou'll just click click let's say youdouble click and the order placed likethe same order placed twice on Amazonsame thing goes for any food deliveryapp or something then not sending thesame message again let's say you are onchat application you typed a nicemessage and then you instead of clickingyou actually double clicked it or maybebecause of BU maybe because of of retryyou clicked again or that transition gotinvoked again you would be sending thesame message to that other person twiceright so basically the overall gist iswhenever there is a possibility of youdoing that same thing twice due toretrice explicit issue bug or somethingyou should not want to do that that'swhat ADM PO is all about right soalthough we guarantee although we alsohave to guarantee item pance whilehandling the API call but in order toensure ke how to even weave thatsolution together we'll take a look intothat approach so first before we jumpinto implementation let's understand whywould a transaction repeat right so thistypically happens when we retry becauseif there isno reason for us to retry thetransaction is going to be in the bookjust once right and this retry could bebecause of double click that user madeso try to prevent that because of an APIfailure that might have happened youretry that I'll take an example of APIfailure which is much more prevalent onwhat exactly happen so let's say I havea payment service and a payment Gatewayso this payment Gateway is something onwhich you send request from A to B Iwant to transfer money and then one shottransfer happens hypothetically I'm justI'm just simplifying the example overhere right so let's say a paymentservice wants to like you got a requestthat a wants to transfer $20,000 to beright so payment service made a requestto payment Gateway and payment Gatewaywhen it gets the request it wouldimmediately immediately transfer a to be$20,000 like hypothetically that's whatthe job of a payment Gateway is in thisexample right so when the request cameinto the payment gway payment gwaystarted processing it because it got therequest so then here it processed thepayment which means it it did thetransfer where deducted money from A'saccount and credited to B's account andthen it send a responsethis response never reached the usercould be two possible reasons first ofall that the response generally did notreach the user because of a networkpartitioning that happens or a networkoutage that happens or otherwise thepayment service crashed because of atransient issue right and once theservice got back up it retried thetransaction after recovery so it retriedit because it saw that hey this paymentis not processed let me ret so then it Rdue to some business logic that youmight have applied some sync workers orsomething right so either paymentservice retried or payment gatewaysresponse was not reached to the paymentservice in either case what paymentservice is doing is payment service isretrying so once it recovered or once itonce it knew that hey I did not get theresponse so hey let me retry it becauseyou know we all know that hey retry inmicroservice synchronous communicationlet's retry upon failure that's and andlet's say hypothetically if you applythat because you don't want to have togive user a poor user experience so youtry to retry on your JavaScript side oron your Android app or on your iOS sideonly right so you fire the same requestagain it goes to the payment gway andpayment gway processes the payment againwhich is where the problem lies becausenow instead of transferring $20,000 fromA to B we transer $40,000 as in $20,000twice from A to B so a literally losttwice money and we gain twice the moneyright so by retrying this we like thisis the classical case why we want itempotent in the flow where if the samerequest is hit again we should not beprocessing it right so let's take let'stake a look at two approaches ofimplementing item poent uh the first onewhich most people typically don't thinkabout is you won't need pance if we donot retry so there are like basicallythere is no compulsion that hey everyAPI you write needs to be item poentbecause in order to implement item poentyou have to make extra checks on thebackend side extra checks on the frontend side in most cases you don't need ityou don't need to have retri you do notneed to have automatic rise what you canactually do is depending on if if yourif your product uh if product or on youruse case you can throw an error to auser if something fails instead ofautomatically retrying it do that rightfor example on Instagram let's say youdouble tapped a photo right and then ifdue to some reason your API callfailed throw error to the user now whydo you want to do automatic retrybecause the root cause of you you havingto make item pent API calls is becauseyou are trying if there is no if you canbuild a system without having a need ofretry then do that so that it avoids theneed of item bance altogether so this issomething that I definitely wanted toadd because most people think hey let medesign the best API out there with allitem p and all best things you don'tneed that to be honest in most cases soyou be your own judge you be the judgeof the things that you are building makethat say call on if you really need itempoent then you build it I'm not denyingthat but but if you do not need it justthrow an error to the user let the userexplicitly retry that for example if thepayment transaction failed where thisAPI call fail propagate this error tothe user saying that hey the thetransition couldn't happen reinitiatethe transition so so then the user willgo through the entire flow and then makethe payment right so that's a better wayof doing it where you are not doing animplicit retry but rather an explicitretry on the user's part user is happyyou are happy why why to even worryabout item poent like that's how by theway that's how real systems are builtyou don't need to make every single APIitem poent it's good to have item poentbut you do not need you you you do nothave to make every API item poent sothink twice before implementing and seeif you really need it then only go forit okay now coming to now addressing theelephant in the room how do we ImplementID so this is one of the most popularapproaches of implementing importancewhere it's obviously very common as wellwhere you say that hey check an updatewhich means that you would retry or youwould update the entry or your backendsystem would do it onlywhen you know that the first transactiondefinitely failed otherwise you would'tdo it right so in this case what you cando is in in the in in the case ofpayment what you can do is you can getthe status of thepayment and then retry only when it isnotprocessed right otherwise you won't doit with what does this mean this meansthat we need to have something thatstrings our session together thatstrings how your payments your paymentget when everyone is talking in syn kehey this was the payment that I wantedto like forexample you need to identify that whatpayment was going on what was thatunique identification that that helpsyou weave your payment from a to be of$20,000 weave together across allservices so that's where what we need iswe need a unique identifier let's let'scall it payment ID right so this issomething that would weave all of yourAPI calls together and the flow goesflow is extremely simple and it goeslike this what you do is your paymentservice generates or rather Ping'spayment gateway to generate a payment IDyour payment Gateway sends the paymentID to this payment service now thispayment ID is something that can youdefinitely would propagate to your enduser site will keep it along with yourpayment service in its own database andthe payment getaway anyway has it in itsown database right so at three placesthis payment ID this payment ID willweave the all the three stages oftransaction in one shot so your user asin your JavaScript CL or Android hasthis one payment ID which was sent to itby payment service payment servicestores it if it stores it in its owndatabase and payment gway keeps a checkof it with respect to the actual paymentbeing processed right so this one thisone ID weaves all the three systemstogether right I'm just oversimplifyingit if I would highly enourage you toimplement it it's not really difficultto do so and just add failures to it andyou'll see the magic behind this rightso the first step is you generate acommon ID that weaves all the all thethree stages together second now whatwould happen is instead of just sayingthat hey transfer $20,000 from A to Byou say transfer $20,000 from A to B forthis payment ID right so p1729 ishypothetically let's say payment ID andthen when it hits like this is somethingthat we got from the user this paymentID came to the payment service paymentservice pass the same ID to payment getsaying that hey for this payment ID I'mmaking the transaction of a to B$20,000 right and now let's say paymentgway process the transaction right whenthen after it send a response either theresponse did not reach the user or theor the service crat the the the the sameerror situation that we saw before sonow what would happen now your paymentservice would retry right either thisretry starts from your payment serviceor it starts from your end user but it'san automatic retry where which is wherewe need to guarantee item po right sobecause the payment was processed overhere now when the retry happens so retrylike because we are sending in the samerequest in first request what we sent ato be 20,000 here I written 2,000 butbasically assume that it's $220,000 letme just make that alteration to notconfuse people let's say$20,000 and $20,000 okay so because weare replaying the same request again weare retrying the same request again whatwe would get is we would say a transfera from A to B$20,000 with the same payment ID becausewe are not generating another payment IDwe are retrying the field R uh we areretrying the fail request so p1729 wepass this request ID the here when therequest is reached to the paymentGateway payment G would check hey what'sthe status of p1729 it would say hey itwas already processed so then it wouldsend a response already completed oralready processed right so no matter howmany times your payment service ininvokes the same API to initiate thesame transfer if the transfer is alreadydone it would not redo thetransaction right so by vieing all thethree stages over this one payment ID issomething that has helped us make ourAPI design item poent and this is one ofthe most popular ways of implementingitem poent which is why in real inactual uh payment gateways also youwould see something very similar IL tothis so if you ever integrate stripePayPal or let's say razor pay into yourstack you would see that at every stageit gives you that one ID that weavesyour entire payment together and that isthe first thing that you do when youinitiate a transaction that's exactlythe first response you get and wheneveryou would want to do anything you passin this particular ID right so this isexactly how all payment systems arebuilt by vieing multiple internalmicroservices or external data flowstogether through one commonidentifier right and if you'd want toever implement this it's extremelysimple to implement this thing locallyand mimic the failures and see how itactually works where you cannot or whereyou would not reprocess the paymentagain and obviously as I mentionedbefore also there are multiple checksthat you would have to put it in theback end depending on the database youhave depending on the data flow you havebut this is the overall idea ofimplementing item poent by weaving thethree systems together using a commonidentifier right nice yeah CH basicallythat's it for this video I hope youlearned something new I hope I like Ihope now you understand how to buildrobust apis robust idop poent apis bybeinging all the services or all themicroservices together with the commonID so yeah if you guys like this videogive this video thumbs up if you guyslike the channel give this channel a suband I'll see you in the next one thanksa done",
    "summary": "This YouTube video explains the concept of idempotency in API design, particularly within the context of payment services. Idempotency ensures that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request, preventing unintended consequences like double-charging a customer. The video highlights scenarios where idempotency is crucial, such as preventing duplicate tweets, orders, or messages due to retries or user error.\n\nThe video emphasizes that not all APIs need to be idempotent. Instead of automatic retries which necessitate idempotency, it suggests handling failures by throwing errors to the user, allowing them to explicitly retry. However, when idempotency is required, the video proposes a common approach: generating a unique identifier (e.g., a payment ID) that ties together all stages of a transaction across different services (e.g., payment service, payment gateway, and even the end user's client). This ID is used to check the status of a request before processing it again. If the request has already been processed, the service returns a \"already completed\" response, preventing duplicate actions.\n\nThe video uses the example of a payment service transferring funds between users to illustrate this approach. By passing the payment ID along with the transfer request, the payment gateway can verify if the transaction has already occurred before initiating another transfer. This prevents the user from being charged twice in the event of retries due to network issues or service failures. The video concludes by noting that major payment gateways utilize similar ID-based systems for ensuring transactional integrity, advising viewers to consider failure scenarios during implementation."

wehave Andreas clling and also my co-hostTJ who loves neovim so much he's nevereven heard or opened a browser in hislifetime uh Andreas clink for those thatare unfamiliar sorry TJ you don't evenget a chance to talk right now hassomehow built a successful operatingsystem and even has started to build anless likely project to succeed which isanother web browser I can't and which isvery shocking to me first off how doesit feel to build an Impossible Projectanother OS followed by anotherImpossible Project abrowser um pretty good I think umit's it's been a journey that's for surebut there's this endless source of fuelwhich is people telling you that it'simpossible uh it's you know uh justsatisfying to one by one go throughthose people and try to convince themit's a bit like um you know howcomedians they sort of focus on oneperson in the audience and try to makethem laugh I I feel kind of the sameabout Hacker News try to get get thatone Hacker News guy to believe so feelgood about it I thought you were goingto say like roast comedians how theypick out one guy and just make fun ofhim for anhour is that how that works that soundsterrible that's that's yeah that'spretty much all rast comedians all rightso so hold on just to get this straightthe motivation is kind of like MichaelJordan Michael Jordan would actuallybefore every game he would pick outsomebody on the other team and you knowstart messing with them and like find areason to be angry with them or find areason to uh affect show them up are yousaying that you have a bit of a MichaelJordan in you where the haters the thatside motivates you well it's certainlynot what kicked things off but over theyears I have um taken a liking to tosort of letting that spur me on I thinkbut um the the whole thing started umand I don't know how How Deeply we wantto get into this but it started back in2018 uh when I had been to a drug rehabprogram and um had learned how to not dodrugs all day and I discovered that ifyou don't do that uh the day is verylong and um I needed to fill it withsomething so I just started programmingand got a bunch of sort of initiallydisjoint pieces and realized at somepoint I could smash them together and itwould be an operating system and thatwas the birth of SerenityOS um I let me pause you one second forwhatever reason you're coming throughreally uh choppy so I'm going to refreshthe source which means I lose the audiofor a second sorry about that all rightyeah no no that's my bad I was tooambitious with theresolution uh right so yeah so itstarted as a sort of um just a hobbyproject to fill my timeout um when Icouldn't do drugs anymore andum ended up just uh snowballing fromthat and uhinitially it was just me you knowbuilding an operating system because Ithought that would be a fun thing to doum in C++ in C+ C++ sure yeah was thatwas that partially inspired by the bysaid drug usage usingC++ no no um it was uh really from fromworking at Apple for so many yearsbefore that um I worked on Safari andwebkit and it's written in this sort ofdistinctive dialect of C++ that I likedvery much and I kind of thought tomyself wouldn't it be neat if the wholeoperating system would be written inthis style it would all be in onerepository all the code would be writtensort of on top of the same librariessame abstractions same templates andcontainer classes and everything likehow fun would that be to hack on okaylet's do that and then I did that um andyeah it was just by myself for 6 monthsand then I posted it I think to Redditum and a bunch of people thought it wasneat and started contributing onGitHub and then a lot of things happenfast forward uh now over a thousandpeople have contributed to it um andwe've spun out all kinds of applicationsand libraries there's like photo editingsoundediting um programming languages andalso a browser which is what I focus onthese days because at some point we justsort of spun off the browser from theoperating system because trying to doboth of those turns out that there'ssort of a a practical limit for how muchyou can really do within one project umand I think we found it or at least itseemed really uncomfortable doing bothof those things in in onerepository um and yeah that's that'swhat became ladybird which is what Iwork on these days and Serenity OS stillexists out there there's a hugeCommunity working on it but I've sort ofmoved on to build browsers insteadbecause that is what I do I think hi I'mthe prime AI your coding assistant howcan I help you I'm looking to

you knowlike the serenity OS like HTML viewerright that's kind of like where whereyou're at right like it was it primarilysort of difficulties having that live inthe same project with Serenity Os or wasit more like an excitement of oh I thinkwe really have the chance to ship like afrom scratch browser was a a combo ofboth as like the motivation to spin itoffso initially I just wanted to put RichText on screen so I wanted to have likemessages where some little part of itwas bold that wasit ambitious very right Rich Text got abrowser that's that's pretty good thatthat was that was the scopeoriginally uh so I wanted Rich text andI thought well what better format forRich Text than HTML I mean everybodyknows it worked on browsers past thereyou goyeah yeah it makes perfect sense rightit's it's just it just makes sense sothat's where it started and then um Iguess having I I've worked on browsersfor many years before this so it wasjust like falling back into this oldhabits uh but good habits not like thehabits I was trying to avoid fallingback into um so I fell back into thehabit of browser engineering and then itjust kind of spiraled I guess uh and itinitially it was just Rich text for awhile and then I thought well you knowwhat's a really nice way to implementRich Text is CSS because if you justhave HTML elements you can do rich textbut it's kind of cumbersome and CSS is agreat way to do that and so I added CSSand then yeah um and then it just keptgoing like that and at some point wewent for almost a year I think withoutJavaScript um and people kept askinglike when are you going to do JavaScriptand build a real browser and I would sayno no no don't don't ask we're not goingto do that this isn't the realbrowser and then one day Ithought why don't we try adding someJavaScriptand that's yeah it's very organic thiswhole thing it grew like fungus reallyuh the whole operating system did andthe community as well and and some waysum little by little every day justpeople um sort of expanding theircomfort zones with what they werecomfortable working on myself as welllike I'd never worked on operatingsystems before but like if you juststart somewhere and work your wayoutwards it's turns out it's prettyapproachable um but to your questionabout like when did it become un umuntenable or whatever to to do this inthe serenity OS repository um it wasalmost more of um social um problem aswellbecause um at the end when the projectswere still in one place we just had um abunch of people who wanted to work onoperating system stuff they wanted todevelop device drivers and work onWindows systems and then there werethese people who were working on browserstuff and they wanted to do JavaScriptoptimizations or like uh you know GPUrendering for for web content and thosethings are pretty far apart uh and thenyou try to put all of those into one CIpipeline where like hey I'm working onthe device driver for this network cardand I have to run this battery ofthousands of web browser testsum yeah so it was like a scalabilityproblem at least that's how I looked atit um it was a controversial decision atthe time because many people liked thatall everything was in one place but itit really just felt like it just got toobig for the one repository model and ourbug tracker was just a mess like you canimagine having a one GitHub bug trackerfor all of these things the world's twolargest projects together yeahright so that was an issue so now we'veseparated into two projects but I Ithink that split has been very healthyand now the people who want to do konelstuff they work on Serenity and thepeople who want to do browsers they workonladybird um and in theory they aresomewhat compatible still but butladybird has diverged um quitesubstantially because um in Serenity OSone of the core principles is that we'regoing to do everything ourselves nomatter what and that's really fun butit's not a great way to ship softwareanytime soon so in ladybird we kind ofrelaxed that whole thing and said we'regoing to use third party software um sowe're gonna take stuff that's not ourcore competency you know like uhlow-level GPU driver stuff like we don'twant to figure out how to talk to theGPU on every platform that we care aboutlet's get the angle Library uh thatalready does this and gives you sort ofan open JL ES3 context no matter whatsits underneath um and other stuff likeskia um curl for networking so we juststarted sort of taking all these bestand brightest libraries from the opensource world and building on top ofthose and that gave us a ton of speedwhich has been great as well but but inSerenity you can't do that that's whythey're sort of not really compatibleanymore what's what's sort of thecurrent state of what is implemented youknow from scratch and ladybird versussome of these you know Big Ticket itemsthat are shared other places because Ithink people you know they hear anotherbrowser their first thought is probablylike oh it's just a chrome reskin orsomething like that right which isobviously like not the case for ladybirdso what sort of right I don't know thisoverarching what places did you pick bigthird party things to do and what areyou guys doing uh on your own so it'sit's sort of an evolving thing we're notexactly sure where the boundaries are uhbut there is no Chrome here there's noFirefox we're not building on top of anexisting browser this is from scratch umand we built out all the stuff fromscratch that we have since replaced withsome third party stuff so we had our ownGraphics stack for example uh but it isjust a something that is not our coreinterest to build like really fastGraphics um so we started using skiinstead uh but in terms of what we aredoing ourselves we are implementing theweb specifications so like HTML CSSJavaScript um and the various sort ofsupporting specs like URL uh encodingall those kind of things um do does thatmean you're implementing your ownversion of JavaScript interpreter SL jitand all that or are using off the shelfoh you are nice what's the what's thename of it it's called lijs it comesfrom the serenity OS tradition of namingeverything lib followed by the mostobvious thing possible so it's not likespider monkeyV8 no no no quickJS as lijs RH JS web engine is called Liweb can you believe it wow nice that's agood name it's a good I immediately knowexactly what it is okay so you actuallyyou are building your own how far intothe JavaScript compliance SLweb uh standards compliance like how farare you into that because it's if I'mnot mistaken the W3 specification forthe web is like 100 million lines it'ssome it's it's it's a it's a numberthat's so massive that I know that it'take a group of people writing a line asecond for like a year to actually getto get itdone yeah that's very possible I don'tknow that that's probably not the bestmetric to measure um completeness ofimplementation but um in terms of sortof compliance our JavaScript engine ishighly compliant uh just a few weeks agoit was the most compliant um if you goby um so the the JavaScript workinggroup tc39 they maintain this test suitefor compliance testing called test 262and we had the highest score at least afew weeks ago I think um the Firefoxteam dumped a uh full implementation ofthe new temporal proposal for JavaScriptuh which bumped them slightly above usso but we're sitting at something like97 point whatever perc uh they just codedumped and bumped themselves up to 97.3but we just have to catch up um but yeahwe we've been sitting on top of that umquite nicely for for a while um you canspeculate as to why at the end of theday it's like super compliance withevery little corner of the spec is isnot necessarily going to make you themost compatible with the web um but weare a nerdy project with many Nerds sowe like just making the number go up soif we can just fix tests and make uhspec compliance number goup that's just fun so we do that anywayum but that's JavaScript so complianceon on like General web content is harderand it's not as well tested because youknow there's many many specs millions ofof lines as you um alluded to there anduh the closest thing that exists is thisthing called a web platform test whichis a um giant project that'sco-maintainer browser vendors so youknow Google Apple mailla and I guessMicrosoft and whoever else buildsbrowsers uh they all collab on thisthing called Web platform tests or WPTand I think the idea is that when youfix a bug in your browser you contributea test to the shared tests Suite so thateveryone can integrate that in theirtesting um it doesn't always work likethat in practice but that's kind of theidea and there's something like 1.8million tests in there so it iscomprehensive um but it's important tonote that I think 1.1 million orsomething like that uh of the tests arespecifically about Chinese Japanese andKorean textencodinguh because yeah somebody wrote like Iguess like a test generator for his petencoding issues and then just generateda truckload to test for that so it's alittle bit weighted um in that randomarbitrarycategory but uh yeah outside of thatit's it's the best thing that we haveand weare um where are we now like 1.7 millionum out of like and and and the leaders Ithink are at like 1.9 or something likethat million um tests passing but we'vedone all the low hanging fruits soum strictly middle and top hangingfruits remain Ithink um but out of all of the if youlook at sort of the browsers that areongoing in development right now youhave at the top you have in terms ofengines you have webkit Chrome and geckoFirefox right and then you have sort ofthree upand cominging engines um whichare us there's uh Servo and there's aBritish project called flow which is aclose Source browser engine only shipsfor Raspberry Pi at the moment and uh ofthe bottom bottom three underdogs we areleading that pack um is Servo is therewrite with rust right uh Servo is arust based don't worry it won you gotyou got a lot of time you're gonnaeasily be able to keep out performingthem you got years years of Runway yeahwell to be fair they started I thinkback in 2012 so like I said you gotyears of Runway you got years of Runwayum sure I I hope they succeed but um wehave been able to stand up a new browserum in half the time since that they'vehad since they started and uh forwhatever reason you know there's been alot of uh chaos around that project Ithink uh they used to be well staffed byMilla and then suddenly they firedeverybody to save money or whatever umand only recently the Linux Foundationpicked it up and decided to fund uhServo so now it's kind of up and kickinga bit again they're making progress it'sgreatum My Hope Is that we see many newbrowser engines not just ladybird umso I would feel much much better if theydid ship and if they shipped somethingamazing so that people get moreChoice ultimately that is what I'm aboutwhat we're about is that we just want toinject some damn Choice into this Marketbecauseuh it's been taken away from everybodyum I guess you know for many reasons butlike you see stuff like Microsoft justthrowing out their own engineconsolidating um back behind chromiumand you see Opera doing the same andanybody who says I'm building a newbrowser in the last five years they'rereally just you know building somethingon top of chromium right and therehasn't been any new attempt to buildbrowser engines for so long um and Ithink it's something worth doing andespecially now you know with uh withwhat's going on with the doj um comingup on Google here and and well we don'tknow what's going to happen with thatbut it is looking a mess right that theymight um have to sell Chrome whateverthat even means uh they might be youknow banned from participating in thebrowser market for x amount of years uhwhat the hell happens to all the peoplebuilding stuff on top of Chrome andGoogle is no longer developing that umit's high time they we see some newengines and some new approaches to thisI think so um all of that to say I hopeserva succeeds I hope they ship uh and Ithink it would be good for them to speedup a little bit but uh I think I thinkthey will TJ hey boss what's up we to gomobile now okay I'm right on it I knowjust what to do do likethis the real way to fix this problem isnot to have me fix your react nativeproblems but instead have infinite redthey are a react native consultancywhere most of their developers have over10 years of professional experience theyhave done extensive work throughout thereact native Community even contributingto many popular and important opensource projects we hope you check themout and we thank them for their sponsorenjoy the rest of the episode let's gospeak of sort of being able to choosebetween uh between browsers like I'minterested like how much do you get touse ladybird as like a daily browser foryou is it like oh every website I go toI I'm opening it in ladybird or like howfar away yeah I mean how far away do youfeel that it I'm just interested youknow for you know for that userexperience how are you feeling on it uhand and how's that going right so forthe average user it is completelyunusable there is no way that you wouldnot be disint appointeduh 100% certainty you would bedisappointed you would say this is apiece of [ __ ] what the hell 100% satislike dissatisfaction guaranteeright nodoubt this is why we're not tellinganybody please download this and checkit out um we arepre-alpha um for a reason becauseeverybody would just be disappointed umit's still possible to build it you youknow because it's open source we'redoing it all in the open but you do needto to do that little um manual stepthere proof of work uh I suppose that uhyou have to provide yourself to get theexperience of being so disappointed inour new browser uh but to your questionI don't I I try to use it every day forlike random websites every time somebodysends me a link I try to open it inladybird and see what breaks um a coupleof websites work well like our GitHub uhdevelopment workflows for example likereviewing pull requests stuff like thatum we've tested those a lot we tend toum fix whatever gets broken there sothat stuff works but you know you throwa random website at it and chances arejust so high that they're using somerandom CSS features that we haven'timplemented yet or some combination ofthings you know like there's really alot of interesting ways to combine CSSfeatures you wouldn't think uh like ohbut if you put a flex boox inside of afloat inside of an absolutely positionedgrid that has this whatever um and thereis the web platform test but there'sonly so much uh coverage in there and umwe're we're constantly discovering newways to combine web platform featureslet'ssay is is CSS one of these uh kind ofprojects where as you fix one yourealize you've broken 10 other ones cuzit kind of feels like they're just sointerdependent on each other that itjust it feels like it just is very verydangerous to fixanything um I will say that if you don'thave the right mental model that willhappen every time um and I am stillworking on my mentalmodel no true mental model mention let'sgo right I I keep keep updating it Ikeep discovering things that I did notrealize um so it's a journey andsometimes s the the patches to themental model are so severe that you justhave to rewrite large parts of things umthings thatseemed like to make sense in the pastyou discover wait a minute it doesn'tmake sense because there's this one Edgecase um a typical thing that that Ialways have to remal model is therelationship between um Heights andwidths in CSS for example like when canyou figure out a width if you only havethe height um what are thecircumstances um especially when thereare percentages involved because thenlike when can you resolve the percentagewell this percentage can only be figuredout once you know how big something isand maybe the size of the thing dependson this percentage value and then whatorder do you do things in yeah uh thatkind of stuff tends to just wreak havocon your mental model when you discoversomething um so we been doing a lot ofthat but um I would say the real chaosfrom CSS comes from the fact that it iscontinuously updated and edited so thesespecs are alive you know it's not likeyou can just get the CSS specs printthem out and then start implementing umif you reload the spec tomorrow somebodymight have changed something and most ofthe time and when you're lucky they'rejust clarifying something like oh thiswas a little ambiguous we've we'veclarified it but other times it's likewe added a new property or a new valuethat this property could have um like umalignment is something like that forexample like they they've reallyexpanded the ways that you can alignboxes within each other and then youjust have to kind of suck it up and saylike okay well I guess you can align abox relative to this now and then youhave to think of a way to do that inyourC++ butum yeah I guess I agree with what yousaid like CSS is like that like you haveto keep working on it so does it reallyso how often is this spec changing inways that cause like a really big churnsomething that actually is like kind oflike Earth shaking comparatively becauseI I would assume like REM and M thosewere probably really painful but theydidn't come around I assume duringladybird development they pre- ladybirdand those would be I know there's newones like I forget that container unitone that just I don't know how old thoseones are but they're new to me and soit's like I keep seeing new units whichmeans you have to thread through just somuch little bits of information just tobe able to like land in every singleplaceit seems very hard does this happenfrequently that you just get wrecked bya whole new feature that you have torethread everything through no Iwouldn't say so like getting reallywrecked by spec changes that's like onceor twice a year um so far okay just onceor twice a year ah just just a few timesa year you know not too bad completelyright but that's okay we we can we canhandle that uh it will be it could beworse I guess you could be writing it inRuss then you'd definitely be sad tohave to changeeverything hey we're not making fun ofRuss right now oh sorry sorry wrongformat continuecontinue yeah no but but you know fairenough like C++ is pretty friendly whenit comes to suddenrewrites um you have to rebuild or likere contextualize some ownership model umand doing that in C++ where you don'thave to it's not so strict about all theownership stuff you know um there arebenefits to that certainly in terms ofdevelopment velocity um and there aredownsides to that as well which weacknowledge but um it has certainlyhelped us I think being in a flexiblelanguage um and we are a very small teamalso like with a small budget relativelyspeaking uh I think if you look at ourbudget compared to our competitors weare something like 0.1% of their budgetyeah um so that means that we have avery different approach to developmentobviously and we have to prioritizedifferently and um take some shortcutscut somefeatures um and the spec changes thathappen dayto day were not necessarilyalways on top of those anyway like wewe're frequently just letting thingsslide and it's more of those major bigchanges that we try to catch up with umand it's okay so far it I do feel liketomorrow they could drop a big specschange on us that would just ruineverything uh this has happened beforethey did this big rewrite of uhnavigation apis and historymanagement called um naviga bles uhwhich is like a comprehensive change tothe HTML specification which we arestill reeling from um I don't think itmakes any difference to you as a browseruser uh but for us it was uh uhsurprising let's say so obviously wehear all the time I mean if you've beenon Twitter for longer than like 14seconds you'll hear that programming inC++ is a horrible decision to make andthat anyone that does it is anintentionally bad actor at this pointpotentially Russian state level actinguh so it sounds like ladybird is largelybuilt if not exclusively built in C++are there any other languages being usedand also is modern C++ as bad as Twitteractually makes it or does the shared andunique and all the other featuresactually make it not asbadwell I think nothing is as bad asTwitter makes it okay umFair true true good answer good answerbut but but there are flaws um obviouslywe are aware of the flaws andwe um we are a C++ almost entirely ourown code of C++ but of course now we'vestarted integrating thirdparty code sowe're also taking in C code such as uhthe curl Library whichis um some very sturdy C that neverseems to fall apart which is cool um andwe are happy to use whatever languageour third party packages use as long asthey're good packages with goodapis um for our owncode we don't have that many problemswith C++ unsafety like um certainly notas many as Twitter would have youbelieve but we recognize that there isthe occasional terrible security issuethat would have been avoidable with uhanotherlanguage and so we do want to build abrowser that people can use and peoplecan feel good about using you know so wedo have to do something about thesethings um we're using C++ just becausethat's where serenos started andserenityos started with that because Ijust wanted to make webkit the operatingsystem um and so it's just like thisweird sort of sequence of events thatled to suddenly having a a C++ codas butuh in the long term we want to well wereally would have liked it if C++ gottheir act together and um added safetyfeatures to the language there were someattempts but the committee has sortof how do I say this in a friendly waylike they're kind of getting in the wayof um I've read about some of it itsounds very it sounds very lightningcharged some of thediscussions yeah yeah it's it's beenrough and there are people who putforward some like serious effort intodesigning safe versions of C++ and uhthey're just having a very hard timeconvincing the committee and the greaterlanguage community that these effortsareworthwhile um that was pretty diplomaticanduh we would have loved it if C++ wassolved somehow in this way uh now itkind of doesn't look like it's going tobe anytime soon and we want to put out abrowser in the next couple of years sowe are looking at alternative apprachapproaches and we've evaluated sort of abunch of different languages and the onethat we ended up with was Swift umbecause everybody liked writing it so wetested a bunch of them um people alwaysask like which ones did you test whatdidn't you like about them and it's like100% bait right like they just want toget into an argument but seriously whichones did you test and why didn't youlike them yeah and be specific so we canreally clip that out of context and makeyou look like you've never written codebeforeright uh well I I I always say that Idon't want to comment on languages whereI haven't written at least 100K linesbecause my opinions on those languagesare not really worth hearing they'rethey're not based on anything that youshould use to make your decisions so umvery anticlimactic to hear for peoplewho keep asking me can I clarify onequick point with that is it a 100K sumor is it 100K singular projectuh I suppose that would be 100K sum yeahjust because you know like a 100K sizeproject is a big project which exposesdifferent warts of a language whereas100K a bunch of small projects you couldeffectively avoid a lot of the warts byhaving 100 1,000 line code projectsright yeah yeah yeah just hello worldall day or just like five uh jsxtemplates you know like Just Produceenough code in some waysyeah uh no so we test we tested all TheUsual Suspects um I had people on myteam spend uh couple of weeks writingrust for example and trying to modelvarious things that they thought wereinteresting like hey take this part ofthe browser try to rewrite in Rust seehow you like it see what kind of troubleyou run into um and initially it waspretty good people were excited uh Ithink in part because there's a lot ofhype around thelanguage um but there was somefrustration that started creeping inand umit's not what happened when they testedsome other languages Swift was the onethat people tested and they sort of cameout of that saying hey wait a minutethis is great I didn't run into anymajor problems and I was able to writethe program the way I wanted I didn'thave to argue with the compiler and itkind of just workedandso it seemed like the right thing to dowas to ignore the hype and just go withthe thing that everybody enjoyed um andthen sort of work backwards from thereto explain what is it about it that weenjoy and what is it about it that makessense for a browser um and that ends upbeing that it's very very objectorientedprogramming friendly which is not thebig thing these days but uh the browserif you ever looked inside abrowser uh it is very 1990s worldbecause browsers really were like thethe core architecture of browsers wasinvented when XML and Java was like thebig thing right back in the 90s and theybuilt this whole document object modelthing around that and now we're stuckwith that and you have to model that inyour programs and that's just a loteasier to do if you have an O friendlylanguage umand if you look at Servo for example Iknow they have to jump through a bunchof interesting hoops and and do a lot ofunnatural patterns in Rust to expresssome of these things that you need tohave in a browser and you can still doit but it's just not natural um so Ithink that's certainly what I enjoyabout Swift is that it just kind of mapsto these things that we want to do umreallynicely but the big downside with both ofthose languages is that neither of themare garbage collector friendlyand the browser is a garbage collectorenvironment because JavaScript is agarbage collector or has a garbagecollector um and so whatever language weuse we have to do our own garbagecollection um and we have one that wewritten ourselves today and now we arefiguring out how to make that thing workwith swift if we had used rust we wouldhave to figure out how to make that usehow to make rust understand itso there there's uh there's no wayaround that um I guess I would say if Iwere starting over today I wouldprobably just pick a language with agarbage collector uh so that this wouldbe a non-issue can can you explain thata little bit more are you are you sayinglike use go or use C or use Java whenyou're saying the language itself hasgarbage collection or a language thatprovides a garbagecollectorum I don't know that the difference isMeaningful okay um I would have justliked it if some else took care ofgarbagecollection Fair um because itis like especially with modernprogramming style garbage collectiongets kind of complicated especially whenyou have stuff like asynchronousprogramming or you make like a Lambdawhere you capture a bunch of stuff andthen that has to stay alive until theLambda executes and um all of thesethings you have to take care of and itwill be real nice if somebody else justtook care of it but we put ourselves inthe silly boat where we have to takecare of that and we're stuck with it sothat's what we're doing now with swiftjust trying to figure out how to makeSwift tell our garbage collector what itneeds to know abouteverything are you saying particularlyfor like the JS runtime are you sayingfor the whole browser you would ratherpick something like that's garbagecollected or both I guess isalso I think I would prefer somethingfor the entire thing because umthespecifications just sort of assume thatyou're in a garbage collector likeenvironment um they will there's no likeMalo and free in the spec they just saylike create a new thing and then set thereference to that thing to nullsomewhere and then it just disappears Iguess um they never explain in any ofthe specs why things disappear and sothe implication is that it's a garbagecollected environment but um it's justnever explained andit's something that um other browserstraditionally they have done a lot ofstuff with reference counting so webkitand chromium um at least those are thecode bases I'm more familiar with theyuse reference countingextensively but then you have theproblem of ref Cycles where two refcounted objects point at each other nowyou leak and um it would have been niceto to if you had if you were using agarbage collector you wouldn't have thatproblem and so for that reason I say heythese specs are all GC assuming let'sjust use a GClanguage uh out of all the things that'sprobably the thing I would do verydifferentlytoday so what's the status of Swift inladybird right now like I know you guysare working on like setting that up andinterop ability I've seen you do quite abit of things in the repo sort ofgenerate it looks like at least from aquick overview like generating Swiftfiles and other like what's the currentstatus are are you actually getting towrite Swift or it's still sort ofexploratory for properly I don't knowshipping it to to whatever prod meansfor for you today it's still kind ofexploratory we're working together withum some folks on the Swift team tofigure out our garbage collectorintegration um it's not something thathas been done a lot and um when I workedon the webkit team I know that the Swiftteam really wanted us to make use ofSwift but um there were all thesecomplicating factors such as the webkitgarbage collector and um webkit neverreally integrated Swift that much and sohere I am 10 years later um outside ofApple but trying to put Swift into mygarbage collector browserengine um so some you just never getaway from Iguess uh so yeah so we're stillexploring and what that means inPractical terms is that we're justtrying to figure out how to get all theinformation the garbage collector needsacross the languageboundary um and we're making progressand the Swift team is very nice veryfriendly and responsive uh but we aresort of just giving them problems thatthey don't normally have and so takestime to figure out the rightSolutions um but we're hopeful it'suh it's kind of exciting I think to seeif we can get this workingbecause um we need ladybird to bedifferent from other engines in manyways you know like if we are justbuilding exactly if we end up buildingchromium again then it's less useful Iwould say so if we do things differentlythen uh we have a bit more biodiversityin the ecosystem is probably a goodthing yeah that totally makes sense I'minterested in sort of to where youenvision like ladybird going Max sort ofwhat's your road map what what are thethings you're shooting for if there areany sort of really unique aspects ofladybird right in uh in that road mapI'd love to hear about those too sure soat the moment we are just trying to makea browser that worksum fair fair enough yep yeah uh so wedon't really have the luxury of likedifferentiation yet uh but we're tryingto plant the seeds fordifferentiation umand it's important to look at what areour opportunities to differentiate and Ithink one of our key strengths is thatwe are not dependent on Google in anyway uh um all the other browsers aredepending on Google either for theircode or for Manpower or for money um andwe are trying to find a new way todevelop and maintain a browser thatdoesn't require a billion dollars or athousand people uh I listened to umpodcast from the open web uh somethingopen web Association this week where hewas talking about the doj case againstGoogle and he had some interestingnumbers he said that there are about athousand developers working on Chromeright now uh paid by Google and thatthey're I he estimated their costbetween $ 1.5 and3 billion peryear whichis a wild I think um and that'scertainly what an operation at thatscale costsbut if the doj decides that that kind ofmoney is just not available at least notin this way then people we're all goingto have to figure out how to buildbrowsers in a different way with a verydifferent budget um and I think that'sanarea that we uh are exploring like umnot that we have a choice you know it'snot like we can say ah screw this let'sjust do the do the billion dollar thingin said oh we'll just do it with abillion dollars I guess it'sfineright um no so by necessity we'reexploring like what would it look liketo build a browser with a tiny team anda tiny budget um and what kind ofcompromises do you have to make to makethispossible but um you know as everythingturns out maybe that information isgoing to be super relevant to allbrowsers um in the near future whoknows I guess the followup questionwould be that if you become successfulbuilding ladybird and Google is in themiddle of potentially being dissembledin some at some level by the dojwouldn't your success then actuallystart to be like against the Monopolythat is being currently prosecuted couldcould you save Google by building abrowser with just a fewEngineers I don't think we have the timenecessary to do that with our the scalethat we're running at right now but umin theory I think it could be done ifyou if if we could get everything toalign correctly um you could certainlymake the argument that like well look atthese guys they're they're building abrowser much much smaller scale uh theydon't need all thatmoney maybe Google just need to berestructured a little bit I don't knowum so if you're saying a bunch ofEngineers all of a sudden startcommitting to ladybird under theseunknown names and all that it mightactually be Google spending a billiondollars to get yoursuccessful all gmail.com weird likethey're thinking veryingsneaky well you know a lot of people saythat's exactly what they're doing atFirefox right that they're just uhsending the money to Milla to to saveoff the antitrust yep umargument uh and on the topic of fakeemails by the way it's it's funny Iremember back before Chrome wasannounced um Chrome was originally builton webkit right and I I know that uh thepeople who were making Chrome they werelike sending fixes to the webkit teamunder fake names um fake emails for awhile before the Chrome was announced sothat was pretty good uh so it's itwouldn't be the first time they'd uhunder their fake identities contributingto otherbrowsers um but no I I don't know I inall seriousness I I don't think thatthat we can save Google in this case umsorry sorryGoogle yeah yeah would have loved to butuhjust going to have to let this one playout do you do you have a guess forobviously not like every website I meanno I don't think any browser works forevery website um but like have a guessfor let's say you know I'm doing mydaily Drive of you know checking GitHubscrolling a little bit on x.com watch aYouTube video you know when when not acommitment this is not a commitmentnobody clip this and say Here's the dateuh but you you know when's When's sortof a guess of when okay you could dothat maybe it's a little slow maybethere's a few you know Edge case kind ofscenarios but someone could actually dothat as a daily driver for ladybirdright so your GitHub stuff you can dotoday cool um scrolling on x.com you cankind of do today you have to uh fake theuser agent because if we if we tell themthat we're ladybird they just say likeno um interestingokay we we'll phone a few friends at Xand we'll tell them to to change thatwe'll get you we'll get you on the listsure yeah no the the user agent stringis a is a constant source of pain for usand uh every day it's like should wejust suck it up and put like Chromewebkit gecko Firefox everything likeeverybody else does just put every otherbrowser name in there and suddenly allthe websites work um so far we've sortof stayed pure we just say ladybird wedon't lie good that's that's been along-standing problem in the terminalworld like people just lie about ter ohGod yeah you know so it's it's like wedon't have to repeat the same mistakesfrom history over and over and overmaybe like other people can just fix thethe other problems and so that's goodI'm excited to hear you're uh you're notcaving to the pressure that'sgood well we're probably going to Caveto the pressure oh no all right let'send it we we don't even need to do liveQ&APrime well the problem here is thatthere there isn't like some some newterm cap or whatever that we can just goand uh fix Fair that's fair um there'sjust every website out there many ofthem unmaintained nobody even knows whatmachine is serving up this damn websiteum they couldn't find the server if theytried and we just have to deal withthose machines being configured in thoseways so at the end of the day we'reprobably just going to have to suck itup and say we are ladybird I meanchromium I mean Firefox I mean Safarijust don't worry about it give us thecontent um but yeah so today if you saythat you're Chrome you say that yourSafari X will work you can scroll thereum and then YouTube was your lastrequest that's the hard one um YouTubeis a very complex piece of web contentuh we are making progress on it we Ithink we have the video Codec stuffnecessary but we don't have like all ofthe um all of the apis hooked up forlike Medias Source extensions whateverthey're called uh certainly none of theDRM stuff um and performance is notgreat for this kind of stuff either butobviously everybody loves YouTube wewant to get YouTube working uh so we arechipping away atit um in terms of a timeline so that youcan clip this um uh we've said 2026 foran alpharelease um that means it's somethingthat we would pre-compile so you candownload and you can test it out andtell us what didn't work it will be alot of things and we will by that pointlike be in a position where we canactually meaningfully take advantage ofof this feedback uh today if you try itout and tell us something didn't work weknow like it wasn't going to work youdon't have to tell us uh but hopefullyuh next year we will it will be like abit morevaluable um but we're not saying anyspecific date in 2026 just 2026 couldmean a lot of things I guess myfollow-up question is like how does itfeel to probably ship an entire browserbefore Prime finishes a project onstream it's a goodquestion ESP since Min are under 10,000lines of code I mean I'm still givingyou a whole year and a half at leastPrime to do it but I'm just anticipatinglike my poly Market bet for this woulddefinitely be on[Laughter]ladybird I guess I don't feel greatabout that I wish that Prime would getto shipfirst thankyou but where's the butt I'm justwaiting for it to have there's no butthe's just rooting for you buddy he'sjust got your back I just want you tothank you all right but real talk GTA 6or ladybird what what your bet here okaywe want a realone [ __ ] um I think they might beat usoh I want tobelieve would directly impact theshipping ofladybird o see now you're asking therealquestions um possibly okay cuz that'slike the danger of life is that you'recompeting on two axes there GTA shipearly 2026 ladybird is now late20226 weird we don't knowwhy somebody uh at Apple told me thatthere was at least one cycle of Mac OSthat was directly impacted by World ofWarcraft comingout so this doeshappen it does see I remember I rememberthose days they were very magical daysyesall right awesome well I I actually wantto go back I want to go back to the dojI have some more kind of questions aboutdoj just and ladybird in general whichis like cuz if if this does happen let'sjust say that the outcome of this isthat Chrome can no longer participate insome stuff for some amount of year somesort of reprimanding slash you know likeintentional government enforced slowdownput on to Chrome what is theimplications of that because that is notsomething I've really thought wellthrough especially since we have analmost total browser alignment aroundChrome right there are a lot ofimplications um I guess the direct issueis that um somebody has to take over alot of things that Google are currentlyowning um that's the chromium engineobviously um but also they do a ton ofStandards work so I would even say themajority of Standards work is is done byGoogle employees today so there are uhif Google is just like booted out ofthis entirely then a bunch of webstandards will just grind to a halt Ithink um at least until somebody figuresout what's going on and and uh othercompanies maybe start pitching in morestaff um and those are sort of Directeffects um because like the Googlepeople disappear but then you have a lotof secondary effects where moneydisappears from um the other browsers soFirefox famously makes what like half abillion dollars a year or something fromexclusively why they pretty much existis because of the the page searching orwhatever you call that that they get alltheir money from right um So thatobviously presents a problem for the waythat they've been maintaining analternativebrowser um I don't think that money isgoing to last that long at least not onunless they significantly change theirstructure and burn rate uh and you cansee that they are sort of Desperatelyflailing around looking for new revenuestreams and stuff and I I hope they findsomething that works but is this thereason why Servo kind of came about wasor the rework on Servo do you think thatthat has any implication from thisbecause I know Servo died for quite somewhile I think From milla's perspectiveServo was kind of a research project umand they looked at it as a way toperhaps develop some interesting newapproaches to browser engine technologyand they've sort of taken the best ofServo and put it into Firefox which isgreat uh I don't know that they werelooking at it ever as a way to build anew browser entirely um I think theirambition was to sort of prototype stuffand bring the best back into Firefox butI I may be wrong about that I've neverbeen inside Firefox I I've just knowsome people who work there um I thinkwhat they said publicly when when theylet the servo team go if I remembercorrectly was just that they wantedto focus on other things and cost-savingmeasures basically like the usualum and focus on other things outside ofthe browser and everyone was likehuh classic browser Behavior where theysaid they were going to focus onnon-browseractivities yeah I mean I I don't like toto crap on other projects and umorganizations and things like that butit it is a little bit sad because I wasa huge fan of Milla ever since they cameout yep um and to see that they're sortof gradually scaling down their interestand investment in the browser stuff andjust like trying to Branch out intoanything else like uh AI or advertisingthe latest thing um it's a little sadbecause we all fell in love with thembecause of Firefox right umso yeah that's that's been a little sadbut I I I have hope that they will finda way um maybe maybe not a way thatcosts them a half billion dollars a yearbut away um but then you also have otherprojects like um Safari and every time Isay this people always say well you know$20 billion a year that's like chumpchange for Apple they don't care but 20billion is not chump change for anybodylike I don't care if you're Apple that'sthat's enough to Make You Care yeahthat's several research projects goingin parallel that's a lot of iPhones eveneven at iPhone prices that's still a lotofiPhones yeah and I I I think you know ifif tomorrow Apple learns that okayyou're not getting those 20 billiesanymore um I think the the calculuslooks a little different for how muchthey care about building a browser umI don't think they would stop but thingswill probably shift around significantlyas a consequence ofthat um and then you have all thesebrowsers that are just building on topof chromium so brave for example or umwhat are all these other ones like ARvaletti valetti vdi vdi there we go sureI think you'reright sure Valentinoum yes all all of those uh that sit ontop ofchromium they're obviously also going tostagnate if nobody is developingchromiumso those are some of the basic sort ofum consequences and and implicationsthat that you can easily reason your wayto I'm sure that if you think thisthrough and if you have more context andyou have a better understanding of whatthe doj is really proposing you can umfigure out a lot of things that mighthappen as well as a consequence whoknows do you think it's pretty likeserendipitous that you're this far intoa browser and these things are happeninglike is this one of those moments wherepeople talk about how you know luck isjust opportunity meet preparedness andyou just happen to have a potentialwhere maybe Brave or one of thesebrowsers are like we need somethingdifferent to avoid this entire potentialconflict let's choose ladybird rightlike cuz you potentially could become analternative right I I think what you'resaying makes a lot of sense um what wasthat opportunity plus preparedness yeahluck equals opportunity pluspreparedness right A lot of people don'tDefine luck random you know not all lifeis just one by pure random chance it'sjust like you happen to be studyingbrowsers you happen to devote your lifeto browsers and now browsers are in thisterrible weird State and you're justlike well this just happens to be apreparedness meant anopportunity right yeah I Ithink that would be lovely I'll say thatum um if we cansomehow if it turns out that we canprovide sort of an alternative solutionto all of this um maybe not now but likein a year or two um if we would be insufficiently good shape that somebodycould start prototyping let's say Braveon top of our engine I think that wouldbe fantastic um and I would say the samething you know if Servo is in greatshape in a year and somebody could startprototyping their browser on top ofServo or whoever umbecause I've always felt that the waybrowsers are funded is not wholesome umit's not great that we have to liketrack users and uh put ads relevant tothem somewhere and then like that moneysomehow changes hands a million timesand eventually it pays for thebrowsersum I feel like it would be morewholesome if we had a different way ofdoing thatand that way I can't think of a way thatwould make as much money as as thecurrent approach does but uh maybe itdoesn't have to be done with so muchmoney um that's kind of I guess part ofwhat motivated me to work on a browseralso was that I always feltlike I mean May I'm a little bit overlyidealistic here I know that but I alwaysfelt like the browsers that exist are alittle bit compromised because they cannever really put the user first umbecause their loyalties are always goingto be to the hand that feeds right andis there such a thing as a as puttingthe user first and putting the userprivacy first if you get your fundingand Staffing from advertising I thinknot really um and that's not to say thatthat projects like Brave aren'tdoing hugely awesome work uh on userprivacy but at the end of the day Iwould love it if we could have a browserthat could put the user first and couldsay that with a straight face no fingersbehind the back or anything um orwhatever you do in America um and youcan say it and you can meanit um I think that would benice yeah one of the questions wasactually about uh Brave that we havefrom our like live Q&A I don't know ifthere's anything else you sort of findinteresting or or cool about uh Brave orlike some of the ideas I I know theywere trying to do like uh like a tokenand they've tried to do like a bunch ofthey got bat they got they they havelike a lot of at least interesting ideasI'm I just love to hear a little bitmore of your thoughts uh on that if youwant to share sure so I think Bravethey've certainly been experimenting tolook for alternative ways to fund umbrowserdevelopment and um I'm not intimatelyfamiliar with how that has worked outfor them but I think it is great thatthey're trying they're trying differentthings and they're just um in generalexperimenting and they're not um peoplelike to say like oh that's just a chromewrapper or like a chrome skin orwhatever and I do feel with brave thatthey are actually building browsers theyjust don't have a thousand people theyum they have the the team in the budgetthat they have and they they do whatthey can with that um and they areexperimenting within the browser spacelooking for alternative um revenuestreams they're notlike um not like Mozilla just trying tothrow everything at the wall and seewhat sticks so I I do I do like them forthatum and I I think they have a ton ofinteresting work on preventing userfingerprinting and things like that likereally like locking down randomJavaScript apis to make the browserappear homogeneous in a in a see ifother browsers um that's pretty cool wewant to definitely do things like thatum and yeah like I said like if in thefuture if there is a future where wecould be the engine for brave I would besuper happy um we'd be happy to to havethem collaborate on on that with us buttoday we're nowhere near that being arealitybut who knows where thisgoes uh go ahead I was just going toread one uh how can you convince peopleand sponsors to join and believe in thisproject even before the first version ofladybird isavailable and do you have like do youhave like Milestones you're hitting andand more attempts you're you're takingat raising more funds if that's evenwhat the right term is forthis right so so we are a nonprofit umcreated last year um and we've beenraising donations essentially um sayingthat um you can sponsor this project butyou can't really buy influence over itbecause we want to be independent sowhat we do is we'll put your logo on ourwebsite and say thank you on socialmedia and then that's the end of that umand as it turns out there are a lot ofcompanies and individuals with money whofeel that what we're doing or what we'reattempting is worth getting behind um sowe have companies like uh Shopify forexample um backing us which they wereour first sponsor actually even beforewe had a nonprofit andum they just like to see somebody tryingthis and somebody trying to um likeinject some diversity into into the webum browser Market I suppose and uh I'msure that they can say that in a muchnicer way than I'm doing off the cuffbut um they were very supportive of ourmission and we're very thankful for thatsupport um and then over the last yearI've been able to find a bunch of othercompanies and individuals who wanted tosponsor that as well and none of themhave been concerned with um specificdates it's more about hey you're doingsomething that we think is worthpursuing we want to back you um a littlebit here go Shoots for the moon youknow and it's been great um one of yourearlier guests uh dhh um is one of oursponsors uh we're very happy to I knewit to gethim I could just I could just feel itcoming when when you're gonna say I justknew you know dhh CommonW yes um he was very nice and convincedhis uh his company to to sponsor us anda bunch of others as well and umnot only that but we also allowindividuals to donate um and I thinkwe're just looking for like we've setthis very tight constraints on how weallow ourselves to be funded rightbecause we don't wantto um sell out influence in any way wedon't want to become dependent on asingle company we don't want to bedependent on like advertising ortracking or anything like that and soit's pretty tight what we can really douh so it's all all about those sponsorsdonationsessentially um how do you how do youavoid doing that though like in a realpractical sense um maybe my view of theworld is a bit too cynical but at theend of the day when someone has Pro likeproven time and time again to be like aproject saving type of funding how areyou not swayed by what they have to sayhow are you avoiding that wholesituation because that is uh I wouldjust assume it's virtually impossible atat some level to just always avoidthat it's it's certainly a an issue umso our main strategy is to keep ourscope so tight that we don't go and hirea bunch of more people just becausesomebody gave us a bunch of more moneyum I I think that's the main mechanismby which we avoid stepping into thistrap so you know if if Google were tosay tomorrow that they want to give us amillion bucks to build this thing thatdoesn't mean I'm going to go higher 10more people right away uh it just meansthat now our war chest is that muchbigger and maybe we will modestly scaleup the team like a tiny little bit byone person or or two or something likethat um I Ithink continuously monitoring sort ofthe diversity of of funds that we haveand looking at where does it come frommaking sure that we don't have just asinglesponsorum I think that's that's our mainapproach tothis uh how is that going to play outover time in the real world well I don'tknow I hope we'll do a good job of it umand I'm hopeful also that we will have arange of diverse sponsors so that thisdoesn't have to become an issue that weeven have to think about um one easy wayto to avoid it of course would be to seta cap on sponsorships and just say likewell we're not going to take any morethanthis umkind of go goes against all of thesecapitalist um impulses that one mighthave like uh but uh or just basical thatsounds a bit kind of risky to say nowhen you're a nonprofit tomoneyyeah yes I'm just thinking out loud andnot not saying that we'll do thatum but yeah it's an important problem tokeep in mind always I think because ofwhat you see happen to every everyoneelse who tries this right like everysoftware nonprofit runs into or everysuccessful software nonprofit runs intosome version of this problem um you cansee a lot of them for example giving outboard seats to big donors and then thathasconsequences or um they become dependenton a single donor that gives way toomuch orwhatever um so yeah we're trying to keepall these things in mind um and movecarefully and keep the teamsmall I love that uh here's another onefor you uh I'll slightly rephrase butbasically I think uh you know pictureladybird I don't know three five yearsfrom now right you have like a browserwhere you're not saying oh it's it'sAlpha you're like using it it's a dailydriver kind of thing um what do youbelieve like the next big hurdle orchallenge is after that like do you havea a vision for the future where you'relike oh if Ladydoes XYZ we're going to be so happywe've conquered like our our next bigchallenge oh um I think the I guessthat's when the real challenge beginswhich is the maintenance of thisthing um and as I was talking aboutearlier like maintaining a browser is abit different than maintaining othersoftware project because of the EverChangingspecifications so it's a bit like you'rewriting an emulator for a video gameplatform that keepschanging um and you have all these ROMswhich are websites and they're releasingnew ones everyday and Ithink there's going to be just aninfinitely long tale of Maintenance workto be done at the end ofthis and maybe this what we're doing nowis perhaps the easy part um getting thisto work with 80 % of the web might bethe easy part and the rest of Eternityis going tobe the last 20% or whatever um I could Icould see it playing out that way and Idon't personally have anything I want todo after this I just want to do more ofthis I love this um in some ways I thinkwhen I left Apple I missed my job andI've I spent the next six yearsrecreatingit just uh instead of sort of to advancewithin Apple I just created a newbrowser so that um I I became in chargeof thatinstead it's a little bit strangestraight to the top yeah you juststarted your own company instead nicesmart I see the CEO it's the way to goyeah but but okay so I I have a couplequestions I I want to kind of do themback to back here but that the the appleone is kind of interesting becauseyou've mentioned this quite a few timesthat you were at Apple I don't know ifyou've stated it what made you leaveApple because obviously Apple I wouldassume being at Apple for a long timeworking on a very core feature thatmeans you're probably in a very securegood position so leaving it is isobviously a non-trivial decision atleast I wouldassume yeah um there were a bunch ofdifferent things uh but I I think themain thing that really happened was thatso I left in2017 and I just had started feeling likeI didn't fit in at the company anymoreand it was in the year after I guess theyear after Trump was elected and thatjust kind of activated everybody insidethe company and people were now supereager to talk about politics all thetimeandum I tried to keep up with that but Ijust wasn't really interested orinvested in the American politics I'mSwedish myself um I don't you should youreally shouldn'tevenright um and so I I just felt like thatwas not the environment that I wanted tobe in um and there were you know therewere many other things as well but it itjust felt like suddenly it felt like Icould easily step away from this and dosomething else and I wouldn't even feelbad about that um so you're saying wecan thank Trump for ladybirds got itwe'll put that that's the tityou very much clip it and ship it boyshe's building a browser okay the bestbrowser the best one I knowof right okay okay but uh on a on a kindof a I guess maybe an equally kind oflight-hearted note if there was onebrowser feature that you could just takeout back and Old Yeller which one woulditbe and why oh my goodness JavaScriptevalprobably oh good good answer good answerI thought you going to say with but evalis also pretty good but with has beendeprecated though it's still alive yeahand with like once you implement withthen you're kind of you're good um buteval just keeps finding new ways toscrew you over um and just you thinkthat you have some great JavaScriptengine optimization that you're cookingup and everything is looking great andthen somebody says well what about evalandthen it turns out that there's somestupid way to add a new VAR if you justeval at the wrong place and then if youadd that new VAR then it breakseverything that you thought you weregoing to do um yeah eval islike constant source of of not fun um soyeah probably get rid of that oneand do I have to come up with more or isif you have one if you have one thatyou're just really jonesing about youcan if not I want to do the inversewhich is what is your favorite featurethe one that you implemented or part ofit or saw it happen that just was likethis is the bestpart it's got to be bolded text right Ithat's what how the whole thing startedoh my goodness we can put bold text onthe screen it's just incredible startedwith a slash or a bracket B ended withthe browser ohyeah umI think my favorite feature might beFlex layoutcuz I was a web I I learned webdevelopment in the 9s and when CSS firstcame out and like Netscape 3 or whatevershipped with CSS I couldn't get my headaround it and it felt weird and clunkybut I eventually understood how itworked but then when Flex layout cameout I thought wow this is how it shouldbeuh it made so much more sense to mebecause I was used to making like gooeyapps with Visual Basic and and stufflike that and it just felt like this isa better way to do gooy apps and finallyCSS is amazing um so I always had a softspot for Flex um if I had to pickone I like this follow-up question toowhich which is the feature you wish thatbrowsers added the most or like whatspec thing are you just like can youplease add thisM it just means more work TJ I'm notdoes he wish for more work uponhimself Tailwind natively in theBrows yeah that's funny I um I talkedwith Adam a while back asking him likewhat would that look like if we didTailwind natively in the browser none ofus could figure it out see but there yougo um Ithink well so you say like it would justbe more work my favorite type of featureis any new feature that allows us toavoid work so um whenever you have usersdoing something in JavaScript that wecould just do in the browser instead Ithink that's generally sweet so um thebig suck for many years was likeJavaScript scroll handlers right youwould handle the scroll event to dosomething like move something aroundbefore position fixed was a thing forexample people would do that in thescroll Handler and likeit was super janky and then position fixbecame a thing or prision sticky forthat matter just taking sort of those umannoying poor performance patterns thatpeople do in JavaScript and turning theminto browser features I just like thoseum CSS animations I guess was a a bigone that just um turned out prettysweet um yeah anything where we can dothe thing for you I think is is nice uhit's it's also the source of um a lot ofcomplexity in the platform becausenobody ever agrees on what we should dofor you so we just end up doing way morethings for you than maybe we should umeverybody has that pet pet thing thatthey want CSS to do youknow but um yeah that that's just nicelet us do the difficult stuff in thebrowser so when it comes to so there'san old saying which is whatever thecurrent year is this is the year of theLinux desktop and it's been going on forI don't know a decade at this point it'sit's a it's a it's obviously a funnyTrope that we all say all the time butthere's also one that kind of has itwith browsers which is web assembly thisis the year of web assembly is thisactually like is there actually a yearof web assembly is it really ever goingto happen or is it always going to bethis is the year of web assembly butthere's only like 10 people actuallyusing itoh that's a good question um I think wemight already be living in the age ofweb assemblyum because there are already really cooltools built on it like uh figma forexample um and it doesn't make a lot ofnoise about itself it just kind of worksand that's how I would like the age ofweb assembly to be that it's notsomething that like oh I'm it would havelike these big gifts and whatever sayinglike oh this website powered by webassembly um it would just be suddenlyyou have all this functionality thatseems like it belongs in a native appbut it just works um so I I get theimpression that a lot of websites arestarted have started just using webassembly and not making a big deal aboutit um because we certainly discoveredthat when we build ladybird that like oh[ __ ] that this website needs webassembly and we're not doing thiscorrectly um so I think we might havejust sneakily entered the year of webassembly without Fanfare okay because Isee generally what I see is that a lotof people do not reach for web assemblyfirst uh I I cannot think of a singleboot camp person that comes out thatdoesn't say like react felt solidsomething like that right it's like thisa very specific way in which you build amodern app I don't hear anybody beinglike Oh web assembly is actually the wayyou want to build a modern app and sothat's kind of what I meant by that isthat it is seemingly for large projectslike figma I think makes sense I wouldassume ding board I'm not sure if itmakes sense but it uses it anyways rightlikethere's a few places that use it and Ijust don't you know I I guess maybe I ammistaken because I'm not the onebuilding the browser so I actually don'tknow the extent to which web assembly isbeingused right so you're thinking of likethe year of web assembly means that nowwe're building entire web apps and webassembly and screw everything else yeahit's like in the sense that you nolonger need to be held to the samestandards that we were because at rightnow it's just like you have toJavaScript all the things but maybethat's just like not a world you have tolive in like I like a I do like the ideaof single language programs meaning thatI could write my back end in C++ and Icould write my front end in C++ and Ijust am Wasing it down and I actuallyjust have that single language kind ofthing because that's the benefit of saytypescript or that's the benefit of allthis stuff that they always talk aboutwhich is you have one definition for athing and it worksuniformly yeah um I don't know thatwe're anywhere nearthat I think the The Usual Suspects thatcome up whenever people talk about thisis like well what about accessibilitywhat about selecting text and yada yadaum classic selecting text problem rightand it's like you try essentially you'retrying to go back to Adobe Flash rightum all roads lead to Adobe Flash and umdo we want to go back there it waspretty sick action script was the bestinternet language of alltime yeah I was just watching a HomeStar Runner the other day uh thinkingflash I don't know if you guys are yepold enough for thatokayum there has been some attempt to specum sort of a web assembly Centriccontinuation or evolution of the webplatform um but I don't think that hasgone anywhere it's um there was aneffort by Ian Hixon who was theoriginal author of the web uh of the HML5 specification and one of the things heworked on in recent years was like whatwould the web platform look like if itwas wasm and the frame buffer and umthat kind of thing but I I don't thinkthat ever really picked up enoughinterest that anybody went to try to doitum I don't know uh I think web assemblyat least the way that it exists today isgoing to be a very incremental thingthat's just added to enhance websites inlittle ways here and there you will seethe occasional huge app but um for themost part it's probably going to belittle widgets anddads um I may be wrong I don't know Ibarely make any websites um you shouldknow that people who work on browsers wedon't know much about web developmentgenerally um I've written you know likehundreds of thousands of lines of HTMLand JavaScript but but as you weresaying earlier they were all essentiallylike three line files just to make aunit test for something so umthis is the reason why we have e weneeded you guys back then and no one wasthereright well I think this actually wrapsup uh the questions there was a coupleother questions um but we're going toignore them for now uh thank you Andreasfor for being on here thank you TJ forbeing the co-host uh Andreas if there isthere anything you wish you could likeuh shill to the best of your abilitiesanything you want people to go check outany links you want added to the YouTubevideo or for Twitchy Twitter to knowabout no not really I can take thisopportunity to shill your terminalCoffee Company have you purchased it Igood answer no I don't drink coffee okaysee I that wasn't an answer though thatwasn't yes or no Imean it's there's no question where youhave to sign that you drink coffeebefore you order it just throwing it outthereright uh no I haven't I haven'tpurchased and not drank any of thecoffee yet oh we have a secret surprisewe'll tell it about you after we're notgoing to tell anybody it'll getannounced in the next month or two butit would be pretty funny to do the demoin ladybird if it's possible we'll talkabout it to afterwards we should trythat yeah but I mean since since I'mShing things uh do go to ladyb bird. orgum if any of this is interesting to youbecause we are always onboarding newdevelopers people are um becomingbrowser developers in in ladybird everyday and it is a lot of fun anybody canlearn how to do it if you've beenprogramming for a couple years ladybbird. org I am spamming the links now Idid do lady bird. org sponsors but I'llalso do ladyb ladyb bird. org ohyeah right and uh if you just want tohear about development you can followladybird browser on X um and if you wantto hear even more about random [ __ ] youcan follow me on X as well oh I thinkthat's a great awesome cling if I getthat do I remember thatcorrectly that'sme let me let me let me dothat every awesome well thanks thanksfor coming on it was really fun yeahthanks for having meguys all right we well hey don't youcan't leave we're gonna leave and thenwe got to talk for a second yeah yeahyeah yeah bye goodbye everyone thanksfor coming on this top shelf episodewe'll see you guys later well I haven'tquite done anything yet I know but thenwe can end the recording so there's nottwo minutes of you just like clickingkeyboard sounds at the end of theeverybody oh my gosh the YouTuberetention",
    "summary": "The YouTube video features an interview with Andreas Kling, the creator of SerenityOS and the Ladybird browser. Andreas discusses his motivations for building these projects, stemming from a need to fill his time after overcoming addiction. He explains that SerenityOS began as a hobby project written in C++ and evolved into a community-driven operating system, eventually leading to the creation of Ladybird. The decision to spin off Ladybird from SerenityOS was driven by social and scalability concerns, as the projects attracted developers with distinct interests (OS vs. browser) and resulted in an unmanageable bug tracker and CI pipeline.\n\nThe interview delves into the technical aspects of Ladybird, emphasizing that it's a from-scratch browser engine, not a reskin of Chrome or Firefox. While Ladybird initially implemented everything independently, it has since adopted third-party libraries like Angle, Skia, and Curl for areas outside its core competencies. Andreas details the challenges of building a browser engine, particularly the complexities of CSS and JavaScript compliance. He touches upon the project's goals, including inject some diversity into the browser market, and the potential to become an alternative to Chromium-based browsers.\n\nLooking to the future, Andreas shares Ladybird's roadmap focusing on creating a functional browser rather than immediate differentiation. He also discusses the team's approach to funding, emphasizing independence and avoiding reliance on a single dominant sponsor. The conversation also touched on the possible implications of the DOJ antitrust case against Google on the browser market and how Ladybird and its team may play a vital role in its future. They are trying to make a browser with only a tiny team and budget and are not influenced by Google. The team is aiming for an alpha release by 2026. He hopes his team can continue to provide an alternative solution that supports other people with building their projects."

    "transcript": "one of my favorite things to read aboutis the history of computing and UncleBob just released a book called weprogrammers that actually Chronicles allthe way from babage to present day aboutComputing and its history and todayUncle Bob sat down with us and talkedabout the greats of computing historyfrom babage and Ada to Von Newman Alantouring and even Grace Hopper and theirstories are absolutely fascinatingtoday's video is sponsored by coderabbit which has semantic analysis andAI powered code review and Century thebest way to track your errors not that Iactually have any more on both thosesponsors later and now Uncle Bob welltoday we have Uncle Bob the legendaryUncle Bob on our stream today and Ithink something that makes this uniqueis that typically this is around likesay a technology that has recently comeout or you've been building somethingreally really neat whereas today we'regoing to be talking more about historywhich is kind of I guess a more unusualone on this channel uh so you justrecently wrote a book that's kind ofchronicling through really the veryorigins of computation all the waythrough modern day from pretty muchevery legendary figure uh that isimaginable all the classic ones Ilearned about through college are inthere and more so it is quite theAmazing Story and so um do you have bythe way just I guess to kind of reallystart this off why even start writing abook on History why not continue downall the technical stuff cuz that'sreally like what people do you selltechnical books for people who want tolearn so why do something so far outsideof the traditional Techroute it's um it's something of atrademark of mine that that at thebeginning of every hour that I teach aclass I open it with a science lectureor a history lecture or something thatthat programmers would be interested inhearing that'll clear their brains sothat they can get ready for the nextlecture I also use it to get everybodyto sit down and shut up after abreak and accumulated enough materialdoing that that I thought you knowthere's a lot of programmers that justdo not know what their roots are and andwhat it was like in those very earlydays and and I think it's something thatprogrammers wouldappreciate and the the the problem withthat was is that the books that are outthere that sort of do that gloss overall the technical details and I wantedto do the opposite I wanted to put thosetechnical details in your face so ifyou're a programmer you can identifywith these people and the problems theywere having at the time so that was kindof the goal behind it all yeah I thoughtum it was really interesting you cantell from from reading it and it's likea very fun read I do have to say um likeas as you're going that it's from theperspective of someone who has you knowdebugged software before but now we'reimagining this uh like when we hadmechanical levers that needed to spin orpunch cards that needed to get fed intoa machine and just thinking about thatand imagining uh the 247 nature of thisand everyone breathing down your neckbecause it's you know World War II orsomething is sort of like oh there's alot going on there that really I neverconsidered before it is kind of a it'ssuch a different world in the sense thatwhen you know back back when both TJ andI were fully and gainfully employed youknow like the breathing down the neckwas hey we have a project we're going towant to get done and also hey we'regoing to go play Botch ball later rightlike it's not the same feeling as likeif you don't finish this in a week wemight lose a war you gottahustle and the rooms the rooms are likeabout to process are the are theequations that model the implosion of aplutonium core don't ask uswhy we just want to know what wouldhappen it's just a math problem we'reinterested in that you need to solveright now or else we're also thegovernment we're definitely known forjust doing fun research trust me we'reall having fun now uh TJ did build avery beautiful road map for all thethings we should talk about and the veryfirst one we should talk about is kindyou know I I wouldn't say it's like apassion project of mine uh but it isdefinitely something that I feel is mostslighted out of out of everybody whichis Charles babage I feel like he justhas the greatest slight against allprogramming because he just always getsimmediately foreshadowed by the personhe ultimately hired to work with him aahLoveless and so I I'm very happy thatthe book starts off here and really kindof talks about the relationship betweenthese two and really emphasizes andshows like how amazing both of themreally were they were both remarkablepeople um babit if you could fault himit's because he couldn't finish anythinguh and and you know we've all knownpeople like this you know where you gethalfway through the project and you losekind of interest in it because there's abetter project that you can do andbabage was kind of that guy over andover and over again so he uh he builtCastles in the Air and he built half themachines sort of and then all of thepeople that he had convinced to helpfund him and stuff would bail out on himin the end and uh he he was reallyleft with this kind of half career orhalf set of projects with nothing everdone nothing ever finished just thistrail of detritus along the way a fewlittle machines here a few ideas theresome Grand beautiful ideas but none ofthem ever brought to fruition that's notto say he never finished anything therewere other things he did do he wrotesome books and he he did some otherprojects like that but the big things inhis life uh he left half finished orless than half finished very interestingguy yeah that like anyone we know rightPrime I don't know anybody who wouldn'tfinish a project I not definitely not meI I can tell you that much I'm justwondering was Charles babage a twitchstreamer or like youknow he was a a social butterfly is whathe was so if if there had been twitch atthe time he would have been on it uh buthe had um all the big names in inVictorian England at the time you knowhe knew people like uh like uh oh crapthe name who wrote The Christmas CarolCharles Dick Charles Dickens he knewCharles Dickens he knew uh wheatstone heknewum George bull he knew all these guysyou know Michael Faraday you know heknew all these guys from that era andthey would all go to each other'sparties and he had Mammoth blowoutparties and he would go to Mammothblowout parties uh he was he was a sosoci character very successful in thatbut then he had this itch to buildsomething technical to solve this reallyinteresting technical problem which Ithink once he had solved it in his brainhe wasn't really so interested infinishing I can relate heavily to thatwould you say that um would you say thatin some sense Charles babage was likethe modern software engineer trying toget VCS to invest in projects comes upwith the great ideaget some money poured in comes up withthe next idea get some money's poured inyeah except that he never did do a youknow sellout there was no exit strategyfor the guy exit allinvestment I mean he got a lot of moneygot a lot of his own money into it toobut he got a lot of money for the thingand you know blew a decade on it uh andthen everybody finally abandoned it evenhis friends you know it was veryembarrassing he had he had wrangled awhole bunch of his friends to help outwith that and then they allsaid never mind we don't actually needthe machineanyway I do think um maybe for some ofthe people who aren't as uh aware oflike what the machine is maybe we canstart with a little bit of background Iwas like I knew that people you know ofcourse before we had you know TI 84sright people had to handw write downcalculations and everything obviouslyright um but like what was the originalproblem back just trying to solvebecause I had never heard it you knowlaid out so clearly as in the bookimagine these two guys sitting outhaving a picnic and the the task thatthey've set before them is to validate aseries of tables created by two separateteams the two separate teams aresupposed to create the same tables thetables are tables of like 60 digigitnumbers something absurd like that andthe one guy reads a 60 digigit numberand the other guy looks to make sureit's the same number right and then thenthey just keep on doing that over andover4,000 ofthem and at the end of it babit exclaimsI wish to God these things had beencomputed bySteam and that sets the thing motionthat sets the motion in his head he wasgoing to do it by steam in the end hedidn't have a steam engine he had acrank butyou have the idea let's mechanize thisthe the goal was to solve um tailorexpansions you need to know the sign ofan angle you do a tailor expansiontailor expansion is just a longpolinomial long polinomial can be solvedthrough the method ofdifferences which you know read the bookto see a really nice example ofthat uh which I did enclosure on on mylaptop uh but very you can reduce theproblemto a number ofadditions instead of calculating each ofthose Pol horrible pols with factorialsand stuff like that you can reduce theproblem down to a bunch of additions andthat's what the uh that's what was onthat those sheets of paper that theywere they were validating you know themathematicians had come up with theformula they'd hand it over tohairdressers who who could um add yeahand these hairdressers would do you knowthousands of additions of 60 digigitnumbers and then it was up to um babitand his buddy uh to validate them thatwas just one of the one of theinstigators of of this machine of hishis machine was going to be doing allthose additions that's really all it wasit was a great big adding machine withuh a bunch of memory in it you know andI didn't realize how the sort of rangeof things that they were using you knowlike sign calculations for they're likeoh we need it for like navigating inboats and like for building stuff orlike for and like oh so the you knowthis was like a real a realjob people just like and I mean this iswhere computer I don't was it originallywith babage or was it later that theyhad this job title ofcomputer the word computer in those daysuh referred to a human right yeah did itstart as the job title in bab's time orwas that later oh that's a really goodquestion um I don't know if they calledthem computers in in babbage's day umthey were they were very low paid menialmanual laborers and they usedhairdressers because the FrenchRevolution um caused a lot of unemployedhairdressers um so could you I don'tknow if they called can we just back upwhat do you mean the French Revolutioncaused a lot of unemployed hairdressersdid it caused a lot unemployed everybodyand hairdressers were particularly goodat addition or was it specificallyhairdressing that really got hit thehardest let's just say that they werefewerheads all makes a lot of sense all of asudden I'm not I'm not Jing aboutthis that's I like that one I'mdefinitely stealing that one for later Idon't know how you're gonna steal thatexceptionally specific piece ofknowledge for later I'm gonna I'm gonnabring it up just randomly to my wife andthen she won't get it and won'tlaugh hey Prime yeah have you heard oftoday's sponsor code rabbit let me guessit's an AI code review tool that peopleactually use and is good yeah that'scorrect let me guess code rabbit's beingused in over a million repositories andhas reviewed more than a 5 million pollrequestokay two in a row that's a little weirdlet me guess it's not just AI butthere's tools built on top such as asgrep linters and more are you StephCurry because you're hitting every shotlet me guess it works on every majorplatform it has Enterprise features suchas sock 2 and it has pluggable llms okayare you that Turkish Guy Mr shooter ifyou know so much about code rabbit whatshould our listeners do they shouldclick the link in the description andinstall code rabbit in their open sourcerepos for free but seriously check outcode rabbit it's actually really good inthe description so I think um you knowin this period of babage I think the Ilove this quote from the book so I'lljust read this and then we can talk alittle bit about this I think before weyou know end up talking a little bitabout ADA as well but the there'ssomething magical about the idea that bysimply applying a physical Force to amachine the machine would do somethingthat had previous previously belonged tothe the domain of thinking which whenlike for us it's so out of common placeright that like I press buttons on themachine and it gets out the rightnumbers like you know we just like typin these little numbers well BL and thenout comes new numbers but man that musthave been crazy for them at the timewell you can you can there's a goodanalogy here I mean we are currentlyAmazed by large language models rightthese things are behaving in way that wefind startling uh that was the same withthem I mean you could add two numberswith a machine what only humans could dothat and all of a sudden you have amachine doing it so it's the same thingit's just at a differentscale yeah I was about to say during theCharles babage part when he was doingthe night or the the parties andinviting people over and then he showedthis kind of you know magical machineoff that people would say like oh mygosh the machines are thick thinkinglike they used like that type of phraseright and so it's like there is a verystrong relation between what Charlesbabage and his people during that daywere experiencing you know maybe wecould say that ours is different but eeither way our perception of it isfairly similar in the sense that we'relooking atmachines thinking and some doing thingsthat only humans had done before yeahand and that's really the issue now youknow give us a couple of years and we'lllook at chbt and and large languagemodels is just machines that but youknow there's that moment when you thinkwow that that thing did that and thenlater on it's like okay it's still oldmachines whocares that that day does need to comesoon forsome okay so I I want to transition kindof to ad Loveless as well but I want tokind of ask more of a contentiousquestion what do you think is theprimary reason why people attribute somuch success to Ada and it almost seemslike babage is more of an afterthoughtor like ah he was there and like that'sabout it well you want my my personalopinion there there's there's a um hasbeen for many decades now a a societalneed to promote uh one gender overanother and and that's really the themotive there we all of a sudden you seeoh the very first programmer was a womanwellokay it's not quite true but you canunderstand why people would want topromote that people with a certainagenda can you can you kind of explainmore like oh sorry go onDJ say I think we see pretty clearlylike babage and you mentioned it in yourbook as well like he doesn't think of itas only manipulating numbers so I meanlike it's true he never finishesanything so I mean maybe he's never thehe's not the first programmer to finishuh British a project which maybe makeshim you know more more programmer righthow many of us havenever mark of a true programmer is donot finishanything it's fair prettyfair uh but it it does seem sometimes hehe gets a little bit shorted in thisaspect of like he only was concernedwith numbers but he he was thinking ofquite a few things in in some level ofsymbolic uh nature it seems oh mygoodness yes I mean he was he wascontemplating having these machines playchess right he he had worked out a amachine to play Tic-Tac-Toe knots andCrosses right he had worked all that outso he was well beyond the idea that thatthese machines were simply numericalprocessors he was well into the wholesymbolic idea and and there have been anumber of Publications out there thathave credited that entirely to Ada andthat's just not fair that's not that isnot the case babit and aah shared a lotof ideas they were um intenselycommunicative they wrote letters backand forth to each other they sentmessages to each other they met allkinds of times they were um they werepair programmers they worked reallyclosely when they could and so any ideathat one had would get cross fertilizedto the other and back and forth so wouldyou would it be more fair like if if therecord were corrected into like maybe aproper historical perspective is thatthey both shared and created this ideaof the symbolic nature of computing andit's not just numbers that they wereable to co-create this idea of beingable to create a machine that couldactually do something more than just addtwonumbers I think they fed the idea backand forth to each other but the originalthe original concept was was babagebabage was thinking about playing chessand playing games long before a gotinvolved now once AA did get involvedthere was a lot morecross-pollination she just loved theidea she she was one of those remarkablepeople who who has um a deep Insightfrom the barest possible evidence youknow she saw one of babbit's mockupmachines and it just kind of sprang intoher brain like oh my God what could bepossible here she was compl completelycompletely over the moon with the ideaof a machine that could follow a set ofinstructions moving data from memory toprocessing and back to memory she had itdown if she had beenborn a hundred years later she wouldhave been a a a significant programmeruh let's see a fun fact um aah Lovelessright she was very connected in theworld right in the sense as she is sheLord by 's daughter what was what washer story Byron's daughter Lord Byron'sdaughter for those that don't know LordByron in influenced Shelby to writeFrankenstein in his summer Mansions wayback right like it's like a really oddlyconnected group of people and she was apart of this odd connection that existsthis was the the middle level nobilityof Victorian England he was uh the Lordof uhof something or other I can't rememberwhat it wasbut uh he was also a jerk he was he wasum the word leio does not do him Justicehe uh was a gambler a drunkard he nailedevery woman he could get his hands on uhincluding some of his relatives um he hewas not a great guy this also the authorof DonJuan Lord Byronyeah the uh the author of Don Wthe the HebrewMelodies very very accomplishedpoet and uh really nasty guy and he heuh wrangled um adah's mother to marryhim and he SED the one child and thechild was female and that that reallybothered him and um through one set ofQuasi rapes after another he was finallyejected from both his home and thecountrynever returned toEngland uh and never saw his babydaughter more than once ortwice and yet she wanted to be buriednext to him and named her children afterhim very strange stuff going onthere it was a confusing time okay youknow we like to say that the 60s were awild time but I think the 1860s mighthave been a lot more wild backthen there were definitely things goingon Theory with Mary sh is fascinating umbecause this was the year of a bigvolcanic uh explosion and it was calledThe Year Without a summer right so youhad uh crops failing all over Europe andall over America and freezingtemperatures inJuly throughout most of the continentsand these guys hit out in in uh TheMansions because they were very rich sothis the mar Alle connection wasfascinating they were all hiding outbecause it was cold and yucky and rainyand they would tell ghost stories and itwas uh Lord Byron Who challengedeverybody to write a ghost story andMary Shel used that OPP that opportunityto write Frankenstein or or thebeginnings of Frankenstein so we havethis lovely connection from Charlesbabit all the way toFrankenstein and lo Behold a summer at avilla at AA was uh gave us a birth tothe uh what's called modern sci-ficategory it's kind of wild to thinkabouta volcano that caused the world to be inWintercausi get commit best feature ever getpush get pull rebase best[Music]feature Sentry can't fix this but it canspeed up slowdowns and prevent crasheswith just five lines of code so you canfix what really matters even if youcan't fix everything else I do think umone of the interesting things thoughthat like I wasn't aware of when I wasfirst uh reading about a was just howmuch she and babage were talking andcommunicating and some of the work shedid in originally translating and thenadding more stuff could uh to hisoriginal uh difference in analyticalmachine could you talk a little bitaboutthat well babit um went on a a tour atone point he was invited to give a talkit was the only talk he gave on theanalytical engine and he did he gave itin in tourin Italy and um he had he hadextracted a promise from the conferenceorganizer that the conference organizerwould write up a document about this butthe organizer did not for two years andthen finally delegated it off to a youngLieutenant the young Lieutenant wrote upconference notes in French and bch gotthem but he's like okay what do I dowith this now and aah was there and aknew French very well so a decided totranslate them into English and whilethat was going on and that was actuallya a gift a a surprise present between AAand wheatstone who had decided to uhpresent babit with the translated notesand babit was so impressed with the withthe translated notes that he told AA youknow you're capable of writing a paperon your own why don't you write your ownand if you don't want to do that letjust add some stuff to this one and AAthen went on to write the famous youknownotations that describe the analanalytical engine from her point of viewand boy does she geteffusive in those notes she's just she'slike glowing and talking about all thegreat things that could possibly happenwell this that and the other thing shegoes over the moon overthis so they're all just doing the VCwork out there really is what you'retrying to tell me you know he I they Idon't think they had any thought thatthey were going to getfunding babit was pretty convinced bythat time that nobody was going to givehim any moremoney the Prime Minister was walkingaround saying how do I get rid of thisguy he's such anuisance so I think he'd blown all ofhis credibility by then but they didthey did um spend a lot of time planningthat machine davage went deep into thedesign of it you know it was how thegears would mesh and how things wouldmove and he had invented this entireDynamic notation that nobody had everthought about before right because mamachines usually were pretty simplethese machines were complicated they hadsteps they were actually like finiteState machines and he had to he inventedthis notation that would allow him totrack from moment to moment to moment tomoment which gear would move and whichclutch would seize and which lever wouldtwist this way so that he could modelout the behavior of a very complexmachine but then unfortunately like manyother babage projects he doesn't finishand spends a lot of money in the processand it kind of lays like somewhat Idon't know dormant in a way for quite awhile um and then I think maybe the yeahmaybe the next interesting character tobring on the scene would be maybe uhJohn Van Newman maybe you want to giveus a little intro on on him and how hesort of comes into this world ofcomputing because it's quite a quite afun Story how he gets started here justJohn Von Newman might might have beenthe smartest person ever born I mean youyou'd have to put that title on VonNewman or Charles or or Einstein orMaxwell somebody like that this this guywas a soring intellect uh he gotinvolved with uh relativity generalrelativity he got involved with quantummechanics in the early days he gotinvolved with nuclear nuclear physicsand nuclear reactions and he gotinvolved with Computing just aremarkable guy and he again he's like anA A A Refugee from from from Europebecause he's Jewish so you know the theanti-semitic winds were blowing prettyhard and he bailed out real fast gotinto the United States got to Princetonwas one of the first guys to get intothe advanced Institute studies atPrinceton and then brought a whole bunchof others over you know like why don'tyou invite Einstein why didn't youinvite all these guys get all these guysover here and a lot of themcame and then and then it's World War IIright and and vanon Newman because he'sa math di he's really good at math he hestarts to work for the ballistics peoplethe ballisticslab and they're trying to figure out howto calculate the trajectory of a of aballistic shell you know Cannon shell uhas it as it travels through thestratosphere because now these thingswere going 101 15 miles high and theywere they were going 45 40 50 miles downrange oh okay like this is World War IIand the big ships on the big gun the bigguns on the big ships they could firewell over the horizon how how do youplan that how do you plan thattrajectory right because these theseshelves are going up into thestratosphere where there's differenttrajectory different pressures differenttemperatures whole different regimes andthe only way to do that properly is toiterate you've got to break it up intotiny little segments and walk your waythrough the atmosphere and then backdown to calculate where they're going tobe so the computational load for ModernWarfare grew well outside the bounds ofhumanbeings and you know they tried to solvethat by having armies of humans armedwith desk calculators that could do addsubtraction even multiply and divide butyou'd still need too many of them andthen they got the IBM card machinesthese card readers really early cardstuff that you could program to do asimple addition it would read a fieldfrom a card it would do an addition itwould punch the result on another cardand then you could move these batches ofcards from machine to machine to machineto machine as they went through verydetailed calculations and Von Newman wasat the heart of that and he was he wastrying to do thesetrajectory comp computation he was alsotrying to do blast computwhat is the best altitude to explode ahigh explosive at and it's not on theground then it's not too high in the airyou've got to find the the best placefor the Maximum Destruction so he wasdoing all of those calculations rightand then he gets he gets this phone callFun's over in England at one point andthe war is Raging already and he'slooking at all the fancy Little Machinesthey've got over there NCR had a cutelittle machine that could add andsubtract and stuff like that and he'sover there and he gets this phone calland he says you know what need you backhere and the phone call is from J RobertOppenheimer nobody knows what that'swhat's going on at that point but weneed you over here Von Newman was theonly scientist the only human as far asI'm aware who had the right to enter andleave the Manhattan Project at will hecould come he could go uh nobody elsehad that privilege I'm not even sureOppenheimer had that privilege but VonNewman did because he had to keepworking for the the ballistics peopleand he needed to work on the ManhattanProject to help them calculate theimplosion characteristics of a plutoniumcoreuh one of the guys who was working withhim uh a young man at the time wasRichard fin working on those cardmachines moving cards around they hadthose card machines running247 week after week after week just todo the calculations in in the crudestpossible way and Van Newman was at theheart of it and Van Newman's looking atthis going this is not sustainable we'renot going to be able to design theseweapons with punch card machines and hewent on a an exploratory tour you knowwhere can I find the machine that willhelp me and he saw Howard Akens mark onebig big machine that was an awful lotlike babbit's analytical engine and hesaw the aniac which is a great bigelectronic machine and none of thoseworked none of those would have beengood enough and he conceived with thehelp of the guys who designed the aniache conceived of theidea that data memory and program memoryneed to be the same memory becausethat's the only way you can getspeed you have to have highspeed programmemory to cycle the instructions quicklyyou have to have high-speed data memoryto get the data in and out fast and youcan't ever sacrifice one for the otherand that was that was the greatInsight that led to the Von Numanarchitecture which we all use today as Iwas reading this section of the book Iwas cracking up because the last sort ofphrase you do when you're talking aboutthis was saying the program had to bedata and I was like oh okay Mr closurelike okay yeah you're letting yourinternal bias these leak here okay I seeright through you on thisone oh I was laughing I was laughing atthat although I get it yes he was rightabout that but you know maybe Lis tookit too far youknow something that kind of took like Iguess the part that I remember the mostclear was I guess I didn't think aboutthe consequences of these machines inthe sense that people had to work 24hours a days on these machines eitherdebugging or attempting to get them towork there was no uh indirect access tomemory it was like the thing you alwaysworked on there's no such thing as apointer any of that but the the partthat kind of blew my mind is that therooms in which they worked in were overa 100 degrees Fahrenheit whatever thatis in fake uh fake land I forget whatit's called Uh Celsius I'm I'm going toget some angry comments that that wasjust me fishing for comments really uhbut it was like it was extremely hot inthose rooms and people would be in therefor hours like it as a sweat box justlike trying to make the these thingswork to actually have this be successfulthat that is just mindboggling to methat it was that hot that was actuallythe univac was that the unac I thoughtthat was the mark one well the mark onewas was a great big machine too but theunivac ones when they built the univacunivac had memory and the memory was uhColumns of mercury that that carriedsound waves but the Mercury had to bekept at 40° C in order to get the rightspeed of sound so they had heaters inthose Mercury tanks that would heat themup to you know 110 degrees fenhe 40degrees C something like that uh and uhof course they radiated like crazy sothe room would get hot they didn't haveairconditioning so they're working in thism in this room with these hot tanks ofmercury no air conditioning and they'retrying to debug these machines they'retrying to wire up these machines anddebug them and they they wound upwearing nothing but shorts and wentshirtless and DOW themselves withbuckets of water just to keep working inin thatenvironment my chair is not ergonomicenough that was actually my firstthought was like they don't even have akeyboard or a chair like like those twoweren't even things yet okay sorry Ijumped a little ahead in the story okayit was the univac that did that okay mybad sorry it was very exting a veryexciting moment you know just to thinkthat just trying to relate like I haveno relation to this part of the story insome sense like I don't think the lasttime I thought about the reliability ofmemory of any kind like you know I I Idon't think I've ever thought of rambeing unreliable it's just it's just nota a facet of my of my thought processlet alone the uh the ability not to havea poter let alone the ability to work ina room that is my room is nicelytemperature controlled and it it feelsgood I'm wearing a hoodie because it'snot 100 plus degrees in this room and solike that whole notion this this stuffthat the work with it was justmindboggling comparatively to what wehad the the viability of memory theaccuracy of memory was a problemactually still is a problem it's justthat we've solved it so well that nobodythinks about it but in the early days itwas a huge problem because the Dropoutof a bit wassignificant it was not uncommon for abit to just not be there and when you'rerunning a program you can't have thebits drop out so so there had to be away to recover and they invented allkinds of schemes parody schemes uh inthe early days of core memory every bitehad an extra core the ninth bit whichwas the parody bit some of them had twoextra cores so that you could recomputein case one of them dropped out uh therewas a lot of that stuff going onespecially and in the early days ofdynamic Ram there was a lot of thatstuff going on probably still is butit's buried so much now that we don'teven think about it so I think it's so Iknow Prime skipped ahead oh go ahead Iwas about to say since I skipped aheaduh sorry TJ took that one right from youuh but you know uh I think we're goingto probably enter into the figures thatI think most people probably have atleast minimally heard of and thatthey're that they're very very familiarwith uh would you mind because this islike a huge historical figure at leastduring my college and all that would youmind kind of giving like a briefintroduction to the next character inthis little character Walk we're doinguh Allantouring Alan touring uh what aninteresting fella he was um all right sothe one thing everybody knows about alenTuring is that he was gay let's get thatout of the way right the away he was a abrilliant young man very smart and yetin only very narrow ways he wasmathematically oriented he liked Maps heliked recipes he liked chemistry but anyother topic and he just wasn't therecouldn't couldn't deal with it he wasnearly expelled from school because hewouldn't deal with social issues or oranything anything outside of the verynarrow Focus if was interested in it hewas deep he went really deep sofascinating guy eventually manages to umbecome a significantmathematician and uh there was thisproblem that mathematicians were workingon at the time David Hilbert the greatGerman mathematician had posed theseproblems and the problems were aboutmathematicsitself is mathematicsconsistent is it decidable all thesereally interesting deep questions and uhKurt goodle blew um blew him out of thewater pretty early on mathematics isneither complete nor consistent um asGLE proved and then it was touring whocame along and touring proved the lastof these which was the decidabilityproblem you can't even decide if amathematical problem is solvable or notthere's no algor gthm that you can runto prove this and the way touring setabout to prove that was by inventing amachine we call them nowadays touringmachines but it was just a a thoughtexercise machine you imagine a a machinewith an infinite tape and it's got asingle window you can move the tape leftor right one cell at a time in thiswindow you can read a a symbol or writea symbol doesn't matter and the operatoris a human being and the human beingdoes all of the op operations accordingto a very simple script which in ourparlance is just a finite State machineIf the symbol is this then do that youknow it's very very simple um and usingthatmachine it's it's the most remarkablepaper to read if you've never readtouring's 1936 paper you know on oncomputable numbers it is just aremarkable paper to read because the manstarts with that very basic idea andthen invent Assembly Language andmacros everything so that in the end wecan prove that there are certainproblems that have no algorithmicsolution proving that that um Hilbert'slast question was no mathematics is notevendecidable it was in the pursuit ofHilbert's three questions that moderncomputing was born and Hilbert saw allof his goals defeated and yet in thatdefeat came came our our modern industryof computation just fascinating touringgoes on you know he writes that paperit's great big paper Von Newman readsthe paper oh that's really cool heinvites touring to Princeton they coupleup for a while then touring goes back toEngland and gets involved with codebreaking and and it's all of this compational ability that allows him toparticipate souhpotently in uh code breaking but he'snot satisfied he wants he wants babbit'sanalytical engine he doesn't say thatoutright but that's clearly what wantshe wants a machine like that andparticipates in the design and theprogramming of the first one or two suchmachines ever to bebuilt like his life goes on and andthere's of course the whole gay thingwhere the the government persecutes himfor being gay and and they you know usechemical castration which doesn't reallywork on him he just goes to Europe uhand and then in the end they um theyfind him dead in his bed with apartially eaten Apple next to him andhe's been very clearly poisoned byCyanide and the rap is that he committedbut his mother says no no way he did nothe was working on with gold he was atgold plating exercises and cyanide isone of the the chemicals you use in thatprocess and she believes that he in amoment of carelessness got a littlecyanide on that apple and when he atethe apple he started to recognize thesymptoms and he knew there was no hopeso he lay down in the bed and that'sthat's his mother's view I actuallyadopt that view I don't I don't thinkEllen touring waswas going to think about in any sense hehad a lot to live for he was he was onthe cusp of some great stuff so you knowI think I think the his mother's view isthe betterview I not I had not heard that uh likeuh alternate proposal for it which islike both both options are very sad youknow what I mean like it's very sadeither way but yeah I hadn't heard thatone in the one case you could at leastsay you know the man died doing what heloved you know okay you know and you canimagine being you know somebody thatsmart and uh all of a sudden you'restarting to get symptoms and you look atthe Apple and you think oh damnit Y come on what was I thinking andthen okay well I know what's gonnahappen next might as well lie down makemyself comfortable not much I can doabout it it definitely changes a lot Imean I I've never heard this eitheruntil this moment I can't believe you'rejust now sprinkling this on me I don'tremember that in the book this is likethis is mindblowing right now but itjust it changes so much about it becauseit's like it it almost in some senselike feels way more sad it wasn't even aself-choice it was just it sounds likean accent like there's a whole worldthat exists in which he could havecontinued to produce amazing things thatwe just miss out on by by sheer OopsyDaisy it soundslike well that that would be mypreferred view um I I think I probablygave you guys a um a draft some earlysome of this stuff got in later okaythat explains flabbergasted right nowyeah that was that was news to me Ididn't catch that in the in the draftthat we had gotten for it but one of thecharacters you had mentioned that I Ithought was very like funny was Hilbertand the quote from him that I thoughtwas uh hilarious right is that he'stalking to Einstein and you know he'strying to convince Einstein that it's soimportant that we figure out all thislike you know lofy math things andEinstein just says like this is sotrivial why do we even care like why areyou worried and Hilbert Hilbert repliesif mathematical thinking is defectivewhere are we to find truth and certitudeand it like cracked me up because itjust reminds me of programmers arguingabout stuff online right now like ifrust safety is defective where could wefind like f never change like they'rejust still angry sending each otherletters on the internet just now it'sover Twitter no my truth hadstarted yes there was the recent rustmemory leak I forget which Linuxcomponent and people are just like it'sover Russ Le memory we screwed it all upthere's no truth in life where's yourGod nowLinux and Einstein's like oh come on getover yourselves yeah that's that what Ipicture is like Einstein quote tweetingthe situation and he's like guys this isso trivial why are we even worried aboutit right like they're all fighting andEinsteinempirically it does doesn't even matterright let's move on that's sofunny only if only historical figurescould tweet I think the world would havebeen a very hilariousplace there's hey Bob there's a bookidea for you re-imagining historicaldisputes as tweet as tweet storms that'swhat I want to see that's a good blogpost minimally I want to see Hilbertarguing with them over tweets andsuddenly someone got a twit longer outI'd like to apologize for what I saidlastmonth T you know John or wait who isHilbert's like main acolyte was itTuring V Newman replying like I'm sorryI wasn't familiar with your game likethe Sha Meme and he leaves he leavesHilbert after oh man that that would bea good one TJ has a whole startup goingon in his head right nowI need to go make a bunch of YouTubevideos with this that only seven peoplewill laugh at because they're reallyinsidebaseball all right you know we thinkeverything's different now yeah but it'sthe same it's the same yeah they theywere doing just exactly that stuff yeahthe the next character though that I didwant us to to talk about and I thoughtthis was a really interesting framing uhwas Gra Hopper and in in your book yousaid that she was the first softwareengineer I'd love to hear you you knowwhere you're coming from on that angleCU I really appreciated in the book andI know Twitter's gonna be mad becausewe're saying engineer but I think itactually applies to her like we're notEngineers but she was yeah she wascertified there were certifications withher I don't I got none ofthat Grace Hopper um fascinatingcharacter um mathematics teacher one ofthe first uh females to graduate Harvardor something like that with a mathdegree she taught at Vasser for a longtime she's in her mid to late30s married to a man I guess it wasn't avery satisfactory marriage uh PearlHarbor happens and she says I'm joiningthe Navy let's get divorced I'm joiningthe Navy so they get divorced and shejoins the Navy she figures she's goingto be sent to a cryptography unitbecause she's a mathematician so shegets her you know she goes through Bootand she goes through officer trainingcomes out as a lieutenant JG whateverthat is in the Navy uh and then um isappointed to uh to Howard aen now Howardaen is this guy who dreamed up of acomputer and thought well we should makea computer an electromechanical machineright should be able to add and subtractmultiply divide should have memory weshould move move things around and itshould follow instructions from papertape that was kind of the limit of hisum his uh uh contribution but heconvincedIBM to build the damn thing actually todesign and build the damn thing uh whichthey did the Harvard mark one a alocomotiv sized machine with a great bigelectric motor that spun at 400 RPM thatdrove all the gears and the levers thatdid all the adding and subtracting andthe memorizing of data and the uh thething was programmed with paper tapewhich the programmers had to punch onehole at a time when you were writingcode you wrote your code on paper and itwas code right in code in the sense thatit was just raw numbers and then youwould take that sheet of paper and youwould push individual buttons on a PAPor tape punch to punch the holes thatwould drive this machine and uh Hoppergets in there there's two other guysthat know how to work themachine and and aen is not one of themaen is off in his office he's thecaptain of the ship he's not going tolet anybody bother him they just have toget the work done these two other guysand she joins and she joins as uh ain'sright-hand man second incommand first officer of the ship if youwish she's got to learn how to operatethis machine she knows nothing about itshe knows nothing about computation ingeneral aen says I want you to calcul atthe the uh the um inter interpolationcoefficients for Arc tangents uh and andyou've got a week 23 digits you gottaand by the way the machine is busy sodon't bother the programmers and uhmaybe we can sneak some time on it butuh you know you're not going to get alot of time which she pulls off shepulls it off and begins to learn how toget real things done on thiscantankerous pth loud machine that'simpossibly slow from our standards butthe fastest calculator alive at the timeand she begins to learn how to do it andshe with her two companions work out thedisciplines for writingcode fornotating Comm code for punchingaccurately for saving routines that theycould reuse over and over they calledthem subroutines they began to put together whatyou and I would consider the mostprimitive parts of a programmingdiscipline but there was none then andshe was the one who was instrumental inthat she wrote the first programmingmanual ever she taught the firstprogramming course ever she inventedterms she came up with a glossery ofterms terms that we use now without eventhinking about it terms like address andandpointer anddebug you know terms that we now justkind of toss around bite bit all ofthese things she wrote down shedrove the community as the as theprogramming Community grew she was theone driving it she came up with thefirst user groups she came up with thefirst computer conferences she was thereat the heart of it all and in the midstof all this the machines were gettingbetter and better at first her her firstone was electromechanical you couldn'teven do a loop I mean you could put thetape in a loop a physical Loop but youthere were no jump instructions therewere no if instructions right so yeahthey did actually do that tapes in Loopin Loops sometimes but usually notusually they wrote instructions to TheOperators about how to reposition thetape if the registers are this otherwiseposition it over here if the registersare that so the if statements and theloops were actually executed by TheOperators at 3 in the morning you knowas they shunter through the thecomputations but later on she gotinvolved with the electronic machinesshe was deeply involved at univac uh andand uh started really programming thesewere the univac machines were vumanarchitecture machines right they hadmemory the data and the programs werestored in memory she was writing in theAssembly Language at the time the thatwas actually the machine language at thetime the machine language was notnumeric it was alpha numeric and so theinstructions were kind ofpneumonic sortof she got involved with that she beganto realize oh this would be like1950 she began to realize that thebottleneck in computwas going to be finding enoughprogrammers that had not been theproblem early but it was starting tobecome a problem we needed to find moreprogrammers and most programmers weren'tgoing to tolerate the Primitiveconditions that she had begun to enjoyso they she recognized the sushi dinnerswere super important is what you'retrying to say like right away she saw itso ping pong tables everywhere is thatthe right yeah yeah yeah we need playareas for the kids yeah yeah all of thatstuff no she was she was really focusedon the languages she said there must bea better way to phrase these languagesthere must be a simpler way it's notquite as complicated and she she came upwith a number of different levels andwith each level they got more and moreadvanced now she wasn't the only oneworking on this other people wereworking on languages too but she was themost dedicated the most disciplined shehad fought through the issues more thanmost people had so in the end she cameup with this idea for the language thelanguage to own all other languages andin the darkness bind them and came upwith probably the worst language everconceived which wasCobalt her her view her her concept wasglorious let's let's use English let'suse English as our language why can't weuse English as our language and theneveryone will understand it which didnot work so question question did it notwork uh because there were because youknow like there's a lot of things thatbecome popular because they becomepopular like there's the whole phraselike C++ is largely popular because uhBJ was just like so forceful with itspopularity that he helped kind of likemake it popular by his own willpower washer language because it's hard for me tosay her language was bad CU I never haveprogrammed a computer back in those daysso it had to be a Great Leap Forwardcomparatively to its counterparts atthat time period but at the same timeother languages were coming why wascobal not like successful is it purelyjust championing what is it it wascertainly a Great Leap Forward there'sno doubt about that nobody had ever puttogether a compiler of that complexityum then it was competing with Fortran atthe time but but very very uh impressivekind of language the the problem withthe language was the motive for creatingit in the first place she she believedthat business would not be interested incomputation if business did notunderstand the programs and businessused English and and she was adamantabout this she she actually at one pointthreatened to walk off the committee andnever talk to anybody again if they didnot adopt English as the language shewas determined about this other peoplewanted to see mathematical formulas sortof like for trand like we use todayin Java and c and C++ and languages likethat uh but she would have none of it wewe're not going to use mathematicalformula right we are going to useEnglish multiply a by B giving C roundedperiod That's how I I've always wished Icould write programs that way that justsounds so much more funny yeah oh yeahyeah me too yeah um and and I did Iwrote some cobal and my fortunately mybrain survived but it was um it was aharrowing experience it's so inefficientand the data model is just so bad andand then you've got to write this theseEnglish statements and they're so wordyso I you know you can tell that I likethe language a lot uh I think it was itwas a great mistake to build thelanguage that way but they did in thelanguage was wildly successful and westill have cobal programs running todaycan't fault it for thatis it successful because if I remembercorrectly uh very integrated with IBMand IBM kind of really integrated withall the banks and then the banks wereall trapped on Cobalt and then no onecan translate it's like we're foreverhere because that's ATMs and that'sthat's just what we all live on for therest of our lives it was not just IBMback in those days there were a lot ofcompanies that were making computers sothere was there was GE there was NCRthere was IBM there wasunivac and they all had um language thatwere kind of similar to Cobalt and andin fact Cobalt took from a lot of thoselanguages and integrated it so they wereall ready to accept it so cobal went ina lot of different directions it wasn'tjust IBM now if you add a few years tothat IBM dominates but at the timeCobalt came out IBM was a significantplayer but it wasn't clear that theywere going to be the dominant oneawesome well this is where I wanted tostop for this episode and people have toread the book If they want to know aboutmore of the history and or maybe we canhave you back on and we can cover thenext era of computing um like a littlebit later in Grace Hopper's career andas a few other people sort of show up onthe scene so we're gon to transitioninto our Q&A section oh can we take aquick pause there could you kind of likeelaborate to everybody uh things wedidn't even talk like don't don'telaborate in any sort of detail butthings we didn't even talk about that wedidn't even cover during this timeperiod because there is quite a bit morewe just kind of really glossed over thatoh my I we did not talk at all all aboutum um Dennis Richie Ken Thompson um thethe inventions of Unix and C what astory that is g Christmas you wouldexpect you know something like C wouldhave been invented by serious peoplethese guys invented C so that they couldplay SpaceWar it's a just a tremendously funnystory and you know they Chang the worldthey changed these guys just to playSpace War they changed the worldwonderful wonderful story we did nottalk about um John bakas the inventor ofFortran what an interesting characterJohn bakas complete nerell could not didnot have any interest in success or lifeor anything he just wanted to party andhave a good time and and magically hebecomes the uh the the most consumateproject leader to date for that timeright just just remarkable so yeahthere's a lot of stories that we did nottell in this in this session but they'rein there and they're fun very much so itwas it was such a good it was such agood read I absolutely love it okay nowwe can go to the Q&A part okay flip tothe Q&A well yeah but I also have aquestion I moderator's prerogative hereum so one of the one of the movies youreference in the book is the forbinproject which is a ridiculously good anunderrated movie in my opinion not verywell known um what's your favoriteprogrammer or like computermovie oh my my favorite computer moviehas to be 2001 nice H9,000 there's chat gbt foryou take a look at the uh at the waythat computer moves through that thatscript and other than the self-motivatedpart how was self-motivated but otherthan that you could see chat gbt doingjust about all that stuff all theselarge language models and and large youknow big learning machines they couldeasily have been doing a lot of thatwork so that's really interesting to meI think of all of the um movies aboutcomputers that one is the most accurateas far as looking into the future gotthe dates wrong but other than that a h9000 kind of device seems to me to befeasible yeah I mean that's is that whatlike 01 really is it's just giving itmore power to keep on running itselfyou're just kind of like let a wild Loophappen around Chad chippity and you canget yourself into a h 9000 situationyeah I'm not I'm not convinced it's assimple as that self motivation is is uma complicated problem to understandrightwell how do you how do you how do youcome up with a machine that queriesitselfmeaningfully it's prettyinteresting but another one of themachine the movies that I liked an awfullot uh from a computer point of view wasJurassic Park because that was realexcept for the one moment where she saysI know this this is a unic system buteverything else was great Dennis n was aterrific character Iit's just wonderful and the other guyright I hate this hacker[ __ ] I mean we still get the meme todaylook at this guy look at this look atthis guy he uses Vim nobody cares[Laughter]see still love that all right let mestart pulling some questions because Ithink one of the first ones right outthe gate is actually pretty good uh sohe says considering the journey from Adato AI if you look 15 years ahead whatpath do you think sof programming willtake do we think we will have moreFrameworks and large software systemsbuilt entirely by AI or will the userwants Factor remain Beyond ai'sreach uh the user the user wantsfeatures will will remain well outsideof ai's reach because they they remainwell outside of most programmer's reachas well um it's very difficult to builda system that that a user wants uhbecause you have to decide you know whatto ignore that the user said and howbetter to to uh address the user's needsand we don't have large language modelsthat can get anywhere near that thehuman will be involved in writing codefor the foreseeable future as far as I'mconcerned it'll get easier uh we'll getthese these things will be a goodassistance they're already kind of fairassistance sort of sometimes but I thinkthey will get better they would becomegood assistants you could give them a atask can say hey write this up for meand then you'd better check it becausethey'll get it wrong so you could thinkof them as a you know a uh collegestudent or something like that uh but umI think that will be a growth inutilitarianism but not a growth inInsight or creativity or uh humanIngenuity I don't I don't think that'scoming anytimesoon we're going to get closer to GraceHopper's uh future right moreprogramming with English maybe at leastfor some small parts of your system coalwas right yeah I mean yeah the query thequery language will probably shift moretowards towards English although mysuspicion is that it will formalize nowwill become a formal query language muchmuch like um lawyers use that certainwords have certain meanings and certainphrases have to be used in certain waysand we will wind up with programs thatlead lead that read like legal documentsuh and will be just as impenetrable totheLayman that sounds that actually soundslike the worst possible future thank youfor making me actually hate my life Ichanged my mind I want the I want the AIto take my[Laughter]job okay I I've got one I like this onea lot um so did switching over tofunctional programming with closurechange or soften any of your views onthings like solid principles or testdriven development oh no not at all umand and the even the idea that it was aswitch over isn't quite right I didn'tswitch over to closure I just startedusing closure um did was there afundamental shift in the way I thoughtno there was a minor shift because I Ihad not been used to uh immutablevariables uh and that was that was kindof interesting for me to get my handsaround and and and you know it's notquite fair to say that I wasn't used toit because I had used other languagesbut this was a a more significant shiftbut that's just a small thing in thepanoply of software holy C most of thestuff I do in closure I used to do inJava I used to do it in C++ used to doit in C most of software Remains theSame just okay it's a little moreconvenient in closure and that's reallyreally all it comes down to do I stilldo test driven development yes do Istill use the the design principlesabsolutely do I still use designpatterns yes I do in fact I wrote a bookabout that topic called functionaldesign um okay this one's not meant tomake you feel old uh but what was itlike growing up at that time period wasthe attitude similar to how people seeAI nowadays I'm not exactly sure whichtime period she's saying but I assume itjust means the ever increasing amount oflanguages and expertise kind of fallingaway the I think uh what what is itcalled it's something like real mendon't eat kich there's that whole topicabout program real programmers don't eatkich and it's just like we use spinningdrum memory because we can program itthe most efficiently and all ofthat I I saw my very first computer atage 12 it was a Plastic Machine it hadthree flip-flops six and Gates uh youcould do three bit problems with it andit was just a little plastic thing thatI could hold in my hands and manipulateand I completely fell in love uh notjust with that little machine but withthe concept of the machine and it it'svery much that at that point I made thecareer decision of my life I knew what Iwanted to be I could see thepossibilities well beyond that three bitdo little machine and I started gettinginto Electronics I built some stuff outof electronics I you know I put togetheryou know machines that could add andsubtract multiply divides in electronicsback in those days it was pretty easybecause we had begun to get integratedcircuits so wiring things together upwasn't too hard card I got um my fatherwould take me me and my buddy to thedigital equipment sales office which wasabout 30 miles away and those guys letus play on their PDP eights and PDP 10sand we would go like everyweekend summer winter didn't matter we'dbe D around on the PDP eights and thePDP 10s in those offices teachingourselves Assembly Language teachingourselves binary teaching all this stuffI wasabsolutely committed to it it was mylife I was going to do this period andthe the Viewpoint at the time just ingeneral was unlimited possibility thatwasn't just me that was everybodyinvolved in the industry unlimitedpossibility we could see Mo's law wecould see that exponential growth youknow we were experiencing it in thesmall but we could see where it wasgoing and that was an exponential curvethat we we all knew we all knew we weregoing to ride that roller coaster to thetop so so and it was a hell of a rideyou know back in those days I don't knowif you you experienced this you couldget a computer you had to get a newcomputer every every year or every twoyears right because the old one was soslow and so small that it just wouldn'trun any of the newsoftware that was just it was it was awild wild time I started out withmachines that had four ofcore and I thought that was a lot rightand and it was every year oh 8K 16k 32ka megabyte two megabytes 12 megabytesthe discs the discs would have maybe amegabyte on them maybe depending on thedisc and they were great big things andthen you know the discs get smaller butthey get bigger inside all of a suddenyou've got 20 megabyte discs and andthen you know 100 megabyte disc then agigabyte oh my God a gig I rememberseeing my firstgigabyte gigabyte those were those werevery headydays you know I got I got to I luckilygot to grow up in some of that era Iremember installing doom and UnrealTournament and having to buy likegraphics cards and then when I went toUnreal tour or I went from unreal toUnreal Tournament it's like I have toget a new computer to be able to run thenext generation of games and everycomputer I got was like 300 or 100megahertz 200 400 800 I just thought itwas going to go like I was too young toknow about Moore's Law and I remember inhigh school like seeing the decline inlike sop sophomore year or yeahsomething like that where was like 1.6and the next year was like 2.2 I waslike hey that's not as fast as it's beenand all it was like 2.5 and it was likejust kept on not going any I'm like whatthe hell's happened in here whathappened all my like what happened tothis I thought we're going forever notgoing forever yeah I mean programmerstoday are going to live in a verydifferent world than Ilived right they're going to live on theplateau now it's a hell of good Plateaubut it is a plateau and that takes adifferent mindset I think so uh sorrysome of uh the people in this chat areborn in this Century uh unfortunately II can't relate but so their question iswhat's the most unhinged fact you foundresearching the book it like uh I don'tknow if you use unhinged it's just kindof likeabsurd the mostabsurd Tale in the book and I'm going tosay it's absurd and yet it's completelybelievable was the path that KenThompson took toAT&T Ken Thompson uh was a collegestudent that's all he ever wanted to bedidn't want to graduate didn't didn'twant to leave school he loved it atschool he knew the uh he had he hadcommand of the big computer room andthat washis he was the operator he waseverything uh nobody touched the machineif he didn't say so and he would usethat as his toy computer at 3: in themorning he uh he decided he was going tostay there forever his his uh professorseventually had to uh fill out the formso that he could go into graduate schoolwhich he kind of reluctantly did hisprofessors had to call up AT&T and saidyou really need this guy and the AT&Tguy comes out and and you know Thompsondoesn't want to talk to him just blowshim off couple of times on the thirdtime the AT&T guy says you know I'dreally like to talk to you and Thompsonfeeds him um what was it fig Newton'sand apple cider or something like thatsome ridiculous and and the guy sayswe're gonna pay your way out to Bellabbs you said I don't want to go wellcome on we'll pay your way out andThompson says well I do have somefriends I could visit out there wellyeah visit your friends and come out toyeah but I'm not taking a job not takinga job and he goes out to B labs and he'svery impressed with with um some of thenames he sees on the cubicles oh he knewsome of those names but he went to visithis friends anyway and the offer letterfollowed him somehow followed him to hisfriends on the east coast and he got thethe offer letter and he opened it up andyou know maybe I'll take the job justcompletely ridiculous you know so if ifyou want to talk aboutunhinged there's aguy and that that particular story it'sjust one of many uh where you think okaythat's the guy that changed the worldokay that's actually pretty fair it'sit's shocking that he literally changedthe world in the sense that c is now themost Mainstay language of potentiallyall time and we're sitting there hecouldn't even get out of college that'sman I could relate to this guy so muchexcept for the whole success partuh when I was reading it I since I'mgoing to join in on this one there Ican't remember who it was so you'regoing to have to refresh my memory butthere was a beard Club to identify ifyou were or were not working on aspecific project because IBM I believedid not allow beards and there's thebeard cult and I was just like this isthe strangest story I have ever heardthat there was that was d d That's rightdude that was so good don't give anydetails away it was so good because itwas just too good all right TJ pickanother one um I so this one's uh fromcodir thanks Cod girl after seeing somuch evolution in computers does it feelridiculous what computers are now do youhave the same Fascination now as you didwhen you were younger I am an absoluteawe of these machines I here we are I'mtalking on one well it's not one it'slike 80 but okay fine I am I am usingthis machine and it is doing things thatI could only imagine in my wildest dream30 years ago and here we are what andokay we've got some problems you know itdrops out from time to time because theinternet was never designed to doanything like this ofcourse but I'm in absolute awe thesemachines are Miracles and even the factthat we're on the plateau now right andthe machines aren't actually getting youknow better by a factor of two everyevery year or so they's still Miraclesand look look look at our society wecarry these things around with us we'got phones we got airpods the airpodshave more computer power than you knowthe NASA had when we went to the moonright I mean the the um the ability tocompute is just so incredible that wethrow it away we just burn it in in inCrazy configurations we program inlanguages like closure which are 30times less efficient than C but whocares we've got the Cycles to burn it'sit's a uh it's a remarkable time rightnow and I am in awe of all of thesemachines I I hope that awecontinues yeah I so I have three littlekids and I like always think about howmy kids expect to be able to talk to anyscreen and have it do something rightthey like expect that if they say likepause something will pause you know whatI mean because they hear me say likepause the music right and it pausesright or like they just they've neverhad a world where the like the computerscan't speak back to them and likerespond and do something and play inEnglish and that it just like magicallyworks like my kids don't think aboutWi-Fi like they're four you know four toand newborn okay so they're not thinkingabout Wi-Fi anyways but I saying youknow like they're not thinking like ohit's cool that I don't have to plug thisinto the wall and listen toskirt you know like like that's me I'mthinking of dialup you know and thenlike my kids yeah it's just crazy tothink their expectation is like allcomputers talk and understand my wordsand do something which iswild I still think about this thing allthe time which is that I used to playthis online game that had a 30 megabyteclient that I had to download and thiswould take an enormous amount of timeand to this day every single time I seea download bar I still think back tothat 30 megabyte download bar going thisis like I'm watching that game downloadevery second it's just like how is thisnot like the greatest thing in theuniverse I still get like all pumped upby download speeds which is just itfeels trivial and ridiculous but to methat's just like the coolest thing inthe universe feel so grateful for it Idon'tknow we live in an age ofMiracles and the best the best emotionyou can feel about that isgratitude speaking of gratitudewhat like I I feel like there's a lot ofuh you know just likeuh especially around the job marketespecially as a junior engineer uh whatare like some words or something thatyou could help kind of kind of bolsterthem up because obviously you are on oneside of your career they're on one sideof their career and theirs maybe feelsless tenuous or less uh achievable thanperhaps your side did maybe I I I don'teven know if that's true true or not butwhat what can you kind of tell them topave the way for the next 20 years shallwe say yeah one thing is is you know Cokind of threw a big big bolus into thejob market so we're trying to get overthat and I think we will very quickly umthe demand for programmers is verylikely to continue to Skyrocket uh forat least the next 10 years you know I Ithink we we double the programming staffin the world every five years so we canprobably continue to do that for a whileI don't I don't think we're going tohave a problem withemployment if you're a programmer andyou want to become a better programmerum you need to read a lot you need totry things a lot you need to experimenta lot you need to play a lot think ofyourself like Ken Thompson right you'reG to play Space war and that's going tolead to Unix and C play a lot get intoit enjoy the hell out of yourself umdon't get fixed in one spot and and Idon't mean by that an employer I mean bya language or a system kind you knowspread yourself around a little bitlearn a little bit about financialsystems learn a little bit about roboticsystems learn a little bit aboutrealtime systems yeah there's a lot ofreally fun stuff to learn in that inthat environment and the more you learnof different environments the moreGeneral you become the more you see therelationships between them and thedifferences between them and the moreyou can cross-pollinate so that's veryimportant also learn more than onelanguage learn a lot of languages makesure there are different kinds of Langlanguages you know Java is fine ifyou're a Java programmer maybe you'reusing roster maybe you're using go whocares but then find some language that'scompletely different right like uselearnforth learn forth what a what a reallyinteresting language that is you knowlearn prologue nobody uses prologueanymore but learn it anyway it's reallyinteresting language and if you've neverprogrammed in C you should program insee just a little bit just to get toyourroots just to get to your roots if younever done any Assembly Language youshould probably spend an afternoon uhdoing some Assembly Language and thenpray to God you never have to doit it's pretty it's pretty primitive uhdo all these things read learn how towrite and I don't mean write code learnhow to write uh your language English orwhatever it is learn how tocommunicate right learn how to organizeyour thoughts into a nice a nicedeliverable that you can hand to otherpeople and they can go oh I see whatyou're saying that will that will helpyou a great deal with yourcareer and learn how to teach because inthe end the best way to learn is toteach you will learn faster and harderthan you've ever learned anything inyour life if you if you find yourselfhaving to teach it so I there's a wholebunch of advice I could throw out on thetablethat's reallygood I would say that was that all W'sin thechat yeah those are very similar to alot of the things we like telling peopleI think there's like a big fear for somereason that like you might spend aweekend on something and it's not likeit doesn't go anywhere or like it's notgood and and it's just like but that'sokay plus like the alternative isprobably like you're complaining tosomebody on Reddit or something likeit's not like you're so optimized withyour time anyways that you couldn'tafford to waste it like you're probablywasting it anyways you might as wellwaste it trying something new like whocares you know and I think uh therethere is this like feeling like oh Ispent the weekend on the wrong languageand now my career is over you know youknow you it's it's very true one of thebiggest mentalities I see right now isthat it's like if you're not on thewhole modern web whatever it is andyou're not constantly making some greatmodern web app if you're not becomingthe most specialized most awesome hyperyou know focused on this one technologyyou know this is just taking Twitter forexample then you're just falling behindlike in lie of the fact that mostprogramming isn't web like web is justone slice of many different forms ofprogramming yet it's been like foistedon many young new incoming uhprogrammers that this is the endall orthe Beall of programming and it justcauses this weird disproportional viewthat if I'm not progressing in this onenarrow vertical therefore am failing andI can see everybody else fall you knowthis guy made Doom capture and I justfailed at this thing therefore I'm theworst programmer it's just like H wellreally you learned that's the that's thebig thing the web is going to goaway okay that's like the biggest in theuniverse keep going goaway okay all right yeah so the web isgoing to go away and when the web goesaway it will go away very fast becausesomething better will come along and itwill sweep through like a storm so beready for that storm it's coming don'tknow when but it'scoming that's a very interestingperspective because I guess for whateverreason I I this is the same thing thathappened to me in high school it's thesame thing that happened to me inseveral aspects of life is I look atcertain moments or time periods as likeEternal like this is the this is the endthis will be the thing that will alwaysbe around but you know life already hastaught me that that has never been truebut I've I guess I've never thoughtabout the web ever going awayI'm gonna have to think about that oneyou just you just ruined my day thanksUncleBob we'll pick a happy question we'llpick a happy question in said uh what isUncle Bob's favorite aha moment he's hadin programming like like get up and havea happy dance level of aha happymomentum well it was probably when I was 12and that dumb little computer that I wastalking about with three flip-flops andsix and Gates I could not figure out howthat worked it was magic to me you knowI could I could put the the programmingelements on it I could cycle it I couldsee the bits change didn't know how orwhy it worked and uh I got the advancedprogramming manual which they sent mefor a dollar I think took six weeks toget to my house uh and I read throughthat it taught me Boolean algebra and ittaught me um basic stuff de Morgan'stheorem and so on uh and then I was ableto write programs for this littlemachine and that was a big aha momentfor me because all of a sudden I couldsee not just the inner workings of themachine but I could see how to makebigger such machines and better suchmachines and I began to understand whatit would take and where this industrywas going so I guess that's the biggesta moment for me awesome well I pr unlessyou have another question we'll probablywrap up okay awesome this is our time towrap yeah thanks Bob for coming on anduh really appreciated uh maybe you canplug the book one more time tell peoplewhere the best place is to get it we'llput a link in the description too forwhen people uh we programmers that's thetitle of the book we programmers Iwanted it to be we the programmers butthe publisher thought that might be toopolitical so weprogrammers and that's a little takeoffon Isaac ASM off iroot so okay kind ofget that idea and and you can get it onAmazon and you can probably a wholebunch of other places too I don't know Ido know it's being delivered so I'veseen I've seen them out there although Idon't have a copy myself yet mypublisher will probably get it for mesoon and by we programmers you don'tmean oui right not like we weprogrammersprogramwe awesome well thanks Bob it's been alot of fun and uh we might have to haveyou uh back on like I said to discussyou know more towards the the the laterparts of the book too it would be funsure sure anytime",
    "summary": "The YouTube video features an interview with \"Uncle Bob\" Martin, a legendary figure in software engineering, about his new book, \"We Programmers,\" which chronicles the history of computing from its origins to the present day. The conversation delves into the stories of influential figures like Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, John von Neumann, Alan Turing, and Grace Hopper. The discussion emphasizes the importance of understanding the historical context and technical challenges faced by early computing pioneers, highlighting how their innovations paved the way for modern software development. Uncle Bob shares insights from his book, focusing on the relationships, motivations, and groundbreaking achievements of these individuals.\n\nThe interview explores the contributions of each figure, starting with Babbage's conceptualization of the mechanical computer and Ada Lovelace's vision of its potential beyond numerical calculations. The discussion moves to Von Neumann's architecture and contributions to World War II computing, Alan Turing's theoretical work on computability and his role in codebreaking, and Grace Hopper's pioneering efforts in programming languages and software engineering practices. Uncle Bob discusses the shift from electromechanical to electronic computing, the challenges of early programming, the evolution of programming languages, and the societal and historical contexts that shaped the field. \n\nThe conversation touches on various topics such as the role of women in computing, the impact of war on technological development, and the philosophical implications of machines performing tasks previously thought to be exclusive to human intelligence.

    "transcript": "99% of AI startups will be dead by 2026.Now, one has to ask the question, isn't99% of startups dead by 2006 or 2026?Isn't that how it always goes? Isn't itIsn't the amount of startups thatactually work fairly low? I'm justsaying. All right. In the late 90s, Iwas a student at Berkeley. Watchinga.com boom unfold like a fever dream.Traffic equated to revenue. Adding.comto the end of something made investorsthrow money at inspire aspiringentrepreneurs. The startup with nobusiness model bought Super Bowl ads andmany people became uh payair preparemillionaires overnight. During myinternship at Sun Micro Systemystems in99 man dang by the way 99 microsystemystems Sun Microsystems. That'slike that's some pretty legendaryengineering going on right there. Pair.Yeah, dude. It's Pare Millionaire. Okay.It's a little bit different. I drivedown 101 by the way. Driving down the101 is like an activity for people whowant to hate their life. Okay. I don'tthink this is the flex you think it is.Nobody.Yes. Saying I worked at Sun MicrosSystemystems. That's a flex. Drivingdown the 101. That's That's like, hey,hey, would you like to have an anxietyproblem? Well, I've got the interstatefor you, right? It is just god awful. Itis the worst place on earth. Officebuildings wrapped in billboards for AltaVista. Excite and other names destinedfor extinction. By 2001, those buildingsstood empty. The following summer, Iwent to a launch party where a startupdropped uh what must have been a half amillion dollars just to announce theywere going to start charging for aproduct that they had been giving awayfor free. The room was filled with VCsand no one blinked. By the time Igraduated in uh in December 2000, theparty was over. From Berkeley, I had aperfect view just across the bay fromthe collapse. 25 years later, we areback. It's kind of interesting tocompare I guess the N. So for those thatdidn't grow up in the 99 I was justwatching the stock market. I was aboutwhat in sixth grade, seventh gradewatching the stock market. I loved towatch the stock market as a kid. Ithought it was really reallyinteresting. And I remember watching allof this explode when I was alive duringthis time. I was always watching thestock market. I really enjoyed watchingthe stock market. I'd have it on everymorning before I'd go to school. I knowthat sounds really weird for like aseventh and eighth grader to be like, Iwatch the stock market every morning,but it I just thought it was the mostinteresting thing back then. And I justrememberso many I still remember uh Books aMillion. So for those that don't know,there was a company called Books aMillion. I wonder if you can pull up thestock the stock chart stock books amillion. Let's see if they still havesome sort of historical chart for itbecause that would be so sweet if we hadsome sort of historical chart. Yeah,books a million. They're claiming itwent all the way up here and then itjust it was just such a sharp incline.Look at that incline. Is there a way tolike select an area?Anyways, Books a Million was one thathas just like absolutely crushed it. Uh,won't let it won't let me go any furtherback in this in this view. Oh, wait. Itwill. I'm going back. We're going back.We're going back.Dang. It stops right here. It stopsright here. I thought there was going tobe more. Anyways, Books a Million uhQualcomm.Uh, Qualcomm, if I'm not mistaken.Qualcomm stock. Uh they may have split.So this will be kind of Dude, I alwaysforget to do a little googly on there.This was during that time. Qualcomm.Okay, they so they did split, butQualcomm at the time was $900 a share.And so it's just like they exploded andthen it took them literally what by thetime they actually caught back up, ittook them almost almost 20 years toactually catch back up to that uh stockprice. Like this was crazy time. Iremember this like you put money intoany stock in 1999, you made money. Youmade ridiculous money. But they did.Well, yes, that's because Qualcommactually sold a real product. But still,their valuation went ahead 20 years intothe future. Like, think about that for asecond. Think about being 20 years aheadof schedule. That's crazy. IPOs werealso off the chain. Dude, it it was aninsane time. For those that don't know,it it was the most magical time. It waskind of like investing in uhcryptocurrency in 2016. Like you didn'thave to be smart. You just had to putmoney into a thing and it just went up.You're just like, \"Man, I'm I'm afinancial guru. Move over, WarrenBuffer.Warren Buffering, I got it.\" It's kindof an interesting the reason why this isan interesting uh reason or interestingthing to compare to is that it is truethat there is a lot of AI startups thatare kind of exploding also reminds me alot of 2017 crypto. I still rememberwhen 2017 crypto like was that was thefull force of it and John McCaffy uh RIPJohn McCaffy uh he came out and saidplumbercoin and like shield plumbercoinand at that point I knew that was theend like that that was officially theend of everything like there was no morewe are now officially in dum zone theend uh let's see the labels have changedbut the logic hasn't and so I kind offeel like AI is having something similarin the sense that so many companies aregetting massive amounts of investmentbut then you have to wonder like what isthe purpose like are you actually ableto do that like obviously cursor iscrushing it but not a lot of people arecrushing it like a cursor uh the labelshave changed but the logic hasn't AIpowered is the new.com startups pitchrappers yeah that's also crazy being arapper is kind of an insane thing liketo be selling you are just startup youare just literally AI incidental by thistime many don't even pretend to own thetech they're built on let's look closerat the houseards. Rappers rely on OpenAI. Open AI relies on Microsoft.Microsoft needs Nvidia. Nvidia owns allthe chips and that let's see that powerat all. No one's in charge. Everyone'sexposed and no one's acting like that'sa problem. Nvidia is the real winnerhere. Can we all just agree Nvidia isthe real winner here? But by the way, Idon't know how much OpenAI relies onMicrosoft anymore. I don't I don't knowif that's true. Aren't they able to notrun on Azareware now? Like they'recontractually required to run onAzureware and now they're no longerrequired to run on Azareware. Um,and soby the way, it's not that being a rapperis bad. It just depends on what you meanby being a rapper, right? Like what whatare you doing with the because let'sjust face it, like you can't build theAI yourself. Most of us don't haveaccess to like a billion and a half andand GPUs to be able to build the thingitself. So that's it's okay being likeeverything's an AI rapper until you haveenough money to be not an AI rapper, butit's just like what are you providingother than just being a rapper, which iskind of interesting. Uh, you know, is itjust slightly more convenient? Well,that's not really a business plan. Ilove how you guys just love the idea ofcalling it a rapper but without the W.Most so-called AI power tools are justpretty interfaces wrapped around open APuh AI's API. Yeah, I think that's okay.First off, if you can do a really goodtool, then there is a lot of value inhaving a good rapper. It hit me when Ilooked under the hood for a podcastproduction tool I'd signed up for. Thepromise, upload your transcripts, getback social posts, summaries, and evennewsletter drafts. Clean UX smoothworkflow, $60 a month. And then I didthe math. If I dropped the sametranscript into a folder and called theOpen AI API directly, I could replicatethe entire workflow in 5 minutes forunder $4, even without writing code. Icould just ask Chad Jippy to walk methrough it. There's one problem herethat I think a lot of So this is what Icall the programmer's problem, which isthat every programmer that gets to acertain experience levelbelieves they can pretty much make allproducts. And so when they see somethingcharging $60 a month, they go, I canjust build that. Why why would I pay whywould I pay $60 a month I when I canbuild that? You know what I'm going todo? I'm gonna spend a long time buildingit, spending effectively thousands ofdollars in my time, and I'll just buildmy own. Save that $60 a month. Easy.Easy. What they don't realize is thatthere's an entire generation of peoplethat don't even know what a file is.Okay? Like, that's a real thing that'shappening among genzers is that they'vegrown up on iPads and these like appsand phones and iPads and they don'tactually they don't even know what afile is. So, when you say, \"Oh, this isstupid.\" like this tier pricing thing.You got to remember that who's theperson running these podcasts? Is it atech person that understands thedifference between a client and aserver? Or is it just simply some personbeing some person that has no clear ideawhat computers are doing and so they'rejust like, I can pay $60 a month for youto do something that cost me hours uponhours every single time. There was nosystem, no infrastructure, just uhmarkup. It's not just markup. It'sprobably this pretty nice, you know,it's this nice rapper. That's when Irealized these aren't products. They'reprompt pipelines stapled to a UI. Yes,that's I mean, that's that's okay,though. I I I like where this guy'sgoing. I like what he has to say, buthe's also, I think, slightly incorrectbecause he's seeing how simple it is tocreate it himself.But if you can get people to use it,it's worth a lot, right? Uh input atranscript. process a few uh let's seeprocess a few hard-coded prompts likesummarize this turn it into a tweetgenerate a LinkedIn post outputformatted text and boxes no backend noIP just API calls on Rails yeah that'sokay that's that's okay I think I Ithink there's this thing that is brokenin programmers heads where they forgetto discount convenience I don't thinkhe's wrong and I'm not sure if I'm theone that's wrong in this situationbut just because something can becopied. I think the real danger here isthat if your product can be easilycopied, somebody else can create it andthat could cause you loss. I thinkthat's where the real danger is is thatyou don't have a competitive moatagainst competition. But I want you tothink about something else.You could have said, can we all agreethat we could have said the exact samething about cursor,right? Like cursor did not have a moatto begin with. They were they forkedliterally Microsoft's editor.They they absolutely had no competitiveadvantage. If anything, Microsoft hadall the money, all the access to open aAI. They had all the internal APIs thatyou're not even allowed to have as VSCode users. They had every singleadvantage to win. And Cursor just gotdone raising $900 million in a whatround C one. Yeah, only two years later,they all have hair like Elon.That's called making some serious money.Okay, it's a good example. It just showsthat just because something's a rapperand just because something usessomething that doesn't look like it hasa strategic moat doesn't necessarilymean that it's bad or good. I I don'tknow enough about windsurf. I've heardwindsurf is more about like so just justI've never actually used windsurf. I'veused the crap out of cursor. Open codeis next for me. SST open code whichlooks super cool. Uh I'm going to Iactually have a little project thatwe're going to build this week to makeuh open code super useful at least inthe way I use machines. So we're goingto be doing that next. But wind surfhere is more like uh like the full AIproduct which I think makes it hard forme to use because I don't want a fullAI. Like that's the reason why I lovecursor is because you press tab. It hasits really great integrated tab featurefor people like me who like to justcode. Like I'm a coder. I am not aprompter. And so when I have somethingthat allows that really accents mycoding, then I like that. Windsurf isthe same as co cursor. I I thinkWindinsurf has a slightly differentapproach than cursor. Uh they'recharging 50 to 100 month to do whatanyone could uh replicate for pennies,not just overpriced. It's dishonest. Anentire business model relies on usersnot knowing how simple it really is. Howmany people pay for convenience? Like,if I could pay $50 to never call anairline and have my thing just booked,I'm going to do that. If I could paymoney to not make to make certain thingsin my life go away, of course, I'm goingto take that. People pay for convenienceall the time. This is convenience. It'slike, yeah, I could do this, but if Ihave to spend 20 hours of my timesetting this thing up to make it work,then it's not worth it. Because if mytime is worth more than say $50 an hour,then I've just spent over a year andsome amount of time in their in theirsfor me to get up to the same likestarting spot and it may not even be asgood. So anyways, that's the heart ofthe term LLM rapper. It's not a product.It's a disguise. Well, it's it's usingan LLM to make something that couldpotentially be a product. I I understandwhat he's saying is that there's thereal he's I I think the general argumenthere is that the real the real value isin the LLM which the real value is inthe thing that powers the LLM which isNvidia which I'm not even sure if that'strue. I think the LLM has a lot of valuein in in of itself. I think the Nvidiahas a lot of value and if you can comeup with a really good use of it I thinkthat has a lot of value. I.e. cursoropen AI's hidden weakness. Everyonetreats open AI as untouchable. theintelligent layer of the entireindustry. Obviously, the very simplething is that I I don't even know ifmodels are that big of a strategic moatanymore. Models used to be the bigstrategic moat. But what happens now?You can now just query a model and trainyour own model and use that to draft offof it. I.e. Deepseek. Deepseek didn'ttake that much money to train. It took awhole bunch of money to get the to getthe hardware. 1.5 billion in hardware,but only 5 million to train because youcan just draft off someone else's model.So, I'm not sure if models are as muchof a a moat as they used to be. Sincelate 2022, nearly every rapper, agent,and productivity tool has stood on theirshoulders. They built the strongestmodel. They had the earliest lead. Noone has reshaped the mark and more. Andyet, they are exposed. Their dominancedepends on distribution. Distributioncomes from the very rappers everyonedismisses. All those SAS tools built ontop of Jippy 4, they're not uh justpassengers. They're OpenAI's customerbase. And if even a few of themcollapse, API revenue goes with them.This is the hidden risk. Rappers burncash on premium users. I do. Okay. So,there is like some small amount of thisthat is true in the sense that there isa bunch of these rappers that are allgetting funded that are all making abunch of calls to open AAI so thatthey're getting extra dollars, but it'salso true with anthropic and all theother model carriers. I'm not actuallysure if this is a real thing cuz I don'tknow the port. The problem is is likeare we over are we oversubscribing to aproblem? If this is all of Open AI'slike requests for tokens is thesestartups, do they represent this or dothey represent, you know, like this?Those are two very different, you know,those are two very different things. AndI I have a sneaking suspicion thisproblem that he's identifying, which Ithink he's correct on, is the smaller ofthe two circles. It's actually a rathersmall amount. You know what I mean? It'sactually Is that an eyeball? It's aneyeball in a ball. You know what I mean?I I think it's actually a rather smallamount.And I think that all these startups,they're not the they're not the lionshare. I think it's the hundreds ofthousands or the hundreds of millions ofpeople that just come in regularly oncea month and ask some stupid question ofchat GPT or five questions and they'reslowly using it more and morefrequently, right? Like I think thatthat's a much bigger use case than thesetokenheavy workflows cuz tokenheavyworkflows it's like yeah it istokenheavy but is it actually a hugeshare? The rappers eat uh eats the cost.Their entire business model hinges onconverting fast enough to outpace burn.Some will most I will say so so there'ssomething that's kind of missing in thisargument which is the useful rapper. Letme give you an example. There's aprogram called I mean Airbnb will havethis a hospitalitos hospitalable Ibelieve is a program that has this andwhat it is is that if you're running saya communicationsheavy platform one inwhich you have to service some set ofcustomers so Airbnb is an obvious one tobe able to press a button and generate aresponse and then lightly edit it is soamazing for a lot of people do you knowwhat I mean it's so amazing for so manypeople in this area and so there's ahuge amount of these kind of rappersthat like literally it's just a rapperbut the cost is forwarded on to all theusers and they're able to produce outmessages a bit faster and they don'thave to think as hard and you knowthere's a lot of people that their wholejob is just communicating and so if theycan have like the basic template come upand go okay I got to edit this this andthis boom we're good to go you don'thave to kind of come up with everythingand so even yeah it's just a wrapperit's like actually super useful and so II foresee a lot of those rappers notgoing anywhere because they're builtinto part of the product they make lifea little bit easier here. People likethem. That's how I kind of think aboutit is it just depends on what the rapperis. Yeah. Better email templates ishuge. Yeah. People discount, you know,as a coder, you discount the value of uhof word calculator, but then everythingbecomes the same. Yeah. Welcome to Oh,like welcome welcome to opt welcome toefficiency, you know, like that's that'swhat it is. I I don't I don'tnecessarily like it, but at the sametime, do you need your MPA cabin thatyou book in the Black Hills to have itsown bespoke way of communicating withyou, or would you rather get theinformation you need out as fast aspossible? The reality is you probablywould rather want the latter than youwould the former. And yeah, it stinksthat like kind of that personal touch isprobably going away, but if it gets youthe good stuff, if it gets you the rightinformation quicker, you like you justdon't care as much. But Terminator,well, Terminator is not going to comefrom an LLM. The only way an LLM isgoing to come from Terminator is we haveto be like super stupid for a very longperiod of time.Like we'd have to like let the LLM, we'dhave to somehow a we'd have to figureout the idea of being able to havesomething that continuously runs andevaluates non-stop running LLM. Thenwe'd have to give it full access to abunch of stuff and then we'd have towait like two decades while it sitsthere and slowly builds up the abilityto actually have robots if even if itcould build up that I mean you'd have tofirst I mean you'd have to give it thedirective of build up a robot army andthen it would have to take God knows howlong for that to work out. I don't knowhow long it is. You're gonna have to askthe big man upstairs how long it's goingto go. And then that's going to have togo for a long ass time. And then at somepoint way deep into the future, you'd belike, \"Oh my gosh, it's a robot army.Crazy.Challenge accepted. I can't believe it.\"You know, like it. Come on. And whenthey vanish, open a Open AI feels it.I'm not sure if they do. Again,I think that thisis that I don't think I don't think it'sout here. I think that it's really uh Ithink it's really small. The paradox,OpenAI owns the tech, but not the users.Rappers do. And those rappers arefragile. Uh thin moes, heavy burn, uhlittle lock in. If they fall, Open AIdoesn't just lose customers. It losesdistribution layer that's propped up bynon-Chad Chippity revenue. Again, I'mnot sure if I buy this. I I I I likewhat he's saying and I think he'sabsolutely correct that there's a wholebunch of rappers that will fail. But Idon't think it falls back onto Open AIbecause for every rapper that fails, forevery 10 rappers that fail, for everyhundred rappers that fail, there's onethat's going to stick around and that issuper sticky because their businessmodel isn't a rapper. I think what I'mactually really hearing, the more I sayit and the more I think about it, whatwhat we're really hearing is that justbeing a rapper probably isn't as good ofan idea long term. And maybe there's alot of really great short-term plays.Just being a rapper itself isn't great.It's having a product that people like,use, or find useful. You know, again,I'll just use like hospitable as anexample. Hospitable, people really,really like. You add AI to it. Peoplestill already use you be like they thewhole purpose isn't just AI. It'shospitable. Now, you've just given themsomething that makes it even moreuseful. you've just made your yourproduct hospitable more what's it calledmuch more uh sticky and so now peoplewant to use it even more and so it'slike you're not a rapper you just accessto and so that's kind of what I'mhearing is just don't just just don't bea rapper right uh you have to actuallyhave a product that people find usefuland then the rapper is fantastic it'snot just one way dependency it's aclosed loop open AI owns theintelligence rappers owns thedistribution everyone's pretending thatuh the other isn't critical but the uhbut the economics say otherwise also thefact that open AI Okay. Again, I'm alsoso confused that Microsoft missed theball on editors. I'm just shocked thatOpenAI also didn't jump in the editorwar until now. Open AAI is obviouslyjumping in, right? The whole Windsurfthing. They're trying to get Windfur.They're trying to do that. They're goingto be making their own products at thatpoint. That makes way more sense cuz I'malways so confused. People who use awhole bunch of this stuff right here,right? I By the way, I was playing withEngineX yesterday. I had a weird problemwith a header being too long. Anyways,it doesn't really matter. Every tokensent through a rapper, paid or not,earns Open AI uh Open AI money. Multiplythat by millions of premium users. Andthese startups become unpaiddistribution arms, subsidizing Open AI'sgrowth while bleeding out. Well, notevery token is worth it, right? Open AAIalso allows premium as well. So,obviously, it must be working. Uh it's aclever uh setup, but it's brittlebecause if rappers go down, OpenAI'sreach shrinks. They can uh try toconvert those users directly, but mostof them weren't signing up for a chatGPT pro. They showed up for workflow,not raw model access. OpenAI has a moat.They have the model, but they don't haveinsulation. Their reach depends onfragile ring of rappers, most of whichare loss-making, undifferentiated, andburning investors money to survive. Whenthat money dries up, OpenAI loses morethan partners. It loses the scaffoldingbeneath its revenue. I don't I don'treally like where this article went inthis direction. I'm not I'm notconvinced that this is true at all.Right. I'm just not convinced at all.You don't have to squint to see it. OpenInstagram. Scroll through your feed.Dozens of AI tools promise arevolutionizing note-taking, healthrecords, procrastinating journal withall clean branding, all powered byJeopardy, and all running in the samebackground pattern. By the way, please,I don't want you to open up Instagramcuz I know a lot of your feeds aren't abunch of AI tools, okay? Okay. I don'tknow what your AI feeds are, but they'remost certainly not that. Take yourinput, send it to Jippy, parse aresponse, drop it into a UI, call it aproduct. That's it. Open AAI gets paidon every call, no matter how thin thedifferentiation is on the surface.That's the real exposure. Brittlenetwork of SAS shells acting as bothcustomer base and growth engine. Allmargin negative, all interchangeable,one policy change away from failure. So,you think I'm exaggerating? Here's whatmost of these products are under thehood.Look at that Python. Look at thatPython. Uh, then they call it from theterminal. That's pretty funny. That'sthe product. Everything else is CSS,billing, and Stripe integration. Uh, sawthe prompt, swap the use case. Wanttweets from a transcript? Adjust the uh,instruction. Want a meeting summary?Change the input. Uh, want a smart emailassistant? Uh, plug in Send Grid.There's no IP, no system, no moat. It'sjust well structured API calls, markup,and marketing. I mean, he is right. I dothink a lot of these things are going todie. Like tweet summarize, tweetsummarizing, I think is just silly,right? these meeting summaries, you'reobviously competing against somethingthat uh goo Google and Slack are alreadydoing. Like if you have a huddle rightnow in Slack, Slack summarizes yourmeeting. I made fun of Dax for nothaving something and in the summary itwas just like and made fun of Dax fornot having blah blah blah. It was prettygood, right? It was a pretty funnylittle thing. But I mean, he is right.Like that's the thing is this article islike right 90% of it, right? Most of theAI product landscape could be rebuilt bya junior dev in under an hour usingJeepy Stripe and boilerplate front end.I don't believe that. That's the enginebehind the hype, the silentvulnerability behind OpenAI strength,the survivability math. It's easy todunk on LLM rappers for being fragile,but the truth is more tangled. Thesetools don't own the intelligence theysell. They rent it. Most rely entirelyon OpenAI, Anthropic, or Claude. Theirproduct is a UI with a few promptsbehind it. Every time a user interacts,they pay the model provider. There's alot of I feel like there's a lot ofrepeat, too. Let's Let's Is there anymore meat left on this thing or or havewe have we got to the meat of thisthing? Unless they built realinfrastructure, memory layers, workflowengines, or distribution modes, they'rejust middlemen, and middlemen don'tlast. But here's the twist. Open AIneeds them, too. You've already talkedabout this. Rappers are the API growthengine. They bring Yep. All right.Jasper, a golden child, raised $100million, hit 90 million ARR, then gotkneecapped by Chad Jippy. Theyscrambled, pivoted to enterprise, addeda model routing, tried building lightcustomer models. They're still alive,but only after valuation cuts and execturnover. This is what survival lookslike when your product rides a rentedintelligence. Copy AI smaller scale samestory 16 million rays 10 10 million ARRhuge premium base but zero moat corefeatures are gypy with a UI they startedlayering workflow tools to addstickiness but switching costs are lowtheir pricing reflects the tension theyneed to grow but can't afford to givetoo much away notably niche researchtool like pre-revenue likely pre-revenuefully reliant on open AI offersummarization analysis features are nowcome bundled in chap chippity theirfeature sets overlap with nativefunctionality. That's not competition.That's extinction risk. Tome viralsuccess story. AI slide deck powered byEgypty 4 and stable diffusion. Millionsof users, but then Microsoft embeddedCopilot into PowerPoint and exposedTome's Achilles heel. They don't own theplatform they're distributing ordisrupting. Yeah, but again, I mean,believing that Microsoft's going to doanything useful. I mean, Microsoft ownsVS Code and here we are. And here weare. I'm not even sure if Microsoft hasthe ability to compete. I think theyhave the intelligence to compete, but Ithink they just have the red tape thatthey can't. And here we are. Yeah,right. Sonic, quite the quite outlier.Uh, raised a little, stayed lean, builttheir own small models to cut cost.They're routing dynamic uh dynamicallyacross Jippy 4 cloud claw and their ownengines. Not invincible, but modular. Ifanyone survives on operationalefficiency, it's them. I don't knowthese people. All right, let's let'sread it. Let's see what he has to sayabout uh Nvidia because now I'm justcurious. The silent kingmaker. Uh beforeAI, Nvidia was a gaming company. GPUs.Actually, before AI, Nvidia was just acrypto a crypto uh uh hash computer. AmI right, dude? Remember when you used tolike go and buy like GPUs? Rememberthat? And then then you just could neverbuy a GPU ever in your life because theywere all gone and you're like, why werethey all gone? Gamers are like thesmallest slice of Nvidia. Arguably theleast understood. They're not acustomerf facing, but their grip on theecosystem is absolute. They don't buildmodels, run apps show up uh in your chatjippity tab. But every time you use AI,you're using Nvidia. Almost every majormodel Jippy 4 claw Gemini is trained anduh served on Nvidia hardware. Over 90%of model training runs on their chipsinference. The process of generatingresponse is still 70 to 80% Nvidiapowered. OpenAI runs on Nvidia clustersinside as Microsoft is racing to securemore GPU supply. AWS even with itscustom silicon still depends on Nvidiafor key workloads. No one scales withoutthem. Nvidia doesn't just make chips.They control the AI supply chain. It istrue. They do control a lot of it. Is aIs uh AMD finally starting to actuallydo something by actually starting to dosomething. Do they have wide support orare they still like That's what I don'tknow. I don't run a lot of models bymyself anymore. We need AMD to fightback maybe. I think Nvidia also has abit of their own models by the way ifI'm not mistaken. If I'm not mistaken,they do. They don't need a a front-endproduct. They already own the pipeline.Microsoft the infrastructure middlemanwith all the leverage. Open AAI may bethe brain of the operation, butMicrosoft is the nervous system. EveryAPI call, every chat jippity response,every model fine-tuning runs onAzureware. That's not a footnote. It'sthe foundation. But yeah, but I'm prettysure OpenAI is trying to uh move off ofAsuware. Am I incorrect or correct onthat? I thought I I thought I readsomething about them wanting to move offand they're they they were contractuallyobligated to run on Aszuare for quitesome time, but I believe that contracthas expired and now they have theability to go somewhere else if theywant. Right. When Microsoft investsbillions into OpenAI, they didn't justbuy equity, they bought control. AsOpenAI's executive exclusive cloudprovider, Microsoft now sits underneathevery LLM rapper that uses Jippy. Everytoken is processed on Microsoft's GPUclusters. They own and orchestrate byAzuare and rent it back with margin. Inreturn, Microsoft got early access toJippy 4 and embedded it directly intoOffice, Outlook, and Teams. OpenAItrained the model, but Microsoftcontrols the distribution. Copilot issimply the brand face. The real valuesits behind the scenes. Microsoftdoesn't need to build the best model.They just need to own the infrastructurelayer. The best model relies on. And ifOpenAI ever tries to walk away, goodluck. Their entire stack fromorchestration to throughput is bound toadd Zuare. Microsoft doesn't just hostOpenAI, they own the terrain it runs on.I mean, I I think this is a good callout though on Microsoft. I think this isactually a really, you know, I I don'town any Microsoft directly as stock, butit's like maybe I need to own moreNvidia and Microsoft. I've always wantedto own more and more Microsoft becauseas much as I don't like the company,they have a lot of they've had a lot ofgood moves and they've continued to havea lot of good moves and make a lot ofmoney. Google is the big winner. wholevertical integration. Yeah, Google.Well, the hard part about Google is thatthey've they've really lost the mindshare. And what I mean by that is that Idon't know. I mean, how many people usea Gemini exclusively? The problem aboutGoogle is I feel like they started it,but they fell behind the usages of itall just because when I think of AI, I Iusually think of going to Grock or ChadJeopardy. I don't think about that. If Ithink about coding, I think about Claudeor Jeypity. I don't think about Gemini.And every time I've used Gemini, I can'treally tell a big difference between itand Jeepy. It always feels like usingClaude is like kind of my go-to wheneverit comes to programming. Grock is greatfor uh questions because it's alwaysreally up to date, right? It's reallyreally up todate. And so I like that. Idon't really care about, by the way, Idon't care about benchmarks. Someone'ssaying I'm behind on benchmarks. I don'tcare about the benchmarks, okay? Thebenchmarks are all cooked. They're allcooked benchmarks and they're allhorseshit. Okay? I don't care ifsomebody's like, \"Oh, well this thing'slike the 50th best coder.\" Like I don'tcare. Your measurement of being a bestcoder is crap. Okay. I produce softwarethat I have to use and maintain and makebetter. That has nothing to do with yourlittle little little nice littlebenchmarks. Oh, your little nice littlebenchmarks. Uhwow. Right. It benchmark maxing is hellacringe. Right. You're absolutely right.But yeah, I agree with it. They'rethey're not they don't make anydifference in my book. I don't use them.Like I Claude 37 did better onbenchmarks than Claude 35, but I thinkClaude 35 is better at coding becauseClaude 37 is just like, \"Hey, I'll turnthat button red.\" Also notice thatthere's this other button that was blue.Turned it red, too. Don't worry, I gotyour back, buddy. Bam. Claw 37. Andyou're like, \"Dog, I wanted that to beblue.\" All right. Hey, I turned thatbutton back to blue. Also turned thatother button back to blue just for you,buddy. Bam. You're like, \"No, I wantedone to be red and one to stop it, Claude37.\" Right? Like Claude 37 just doesextra all the time and it just isso annoying. And so it's like, yeah, Iget that it's way better on benchmarks,but it's not like better for me. It'sway worse for me. Just saying.Infer too much. Yeah, I know, dude. It'sIt's coming up with all the answers. Ifsomething happens to Nvidia, a supplychain disruption, a manufacturing delay,a ge geopolitical sanction, an exportban, the entire AI system stalls,training slows, inference bottlenecks,product development halts, and suddenlyit's no longer about feature velocity orfundraising. It's about access tocompute, whether you have it uh any atall. It's I I feel like this has alwaysbeen a big part of this is that accessto compute is such a huge selling point.Like that's the real winner right now.That's why AWS and Microsoft are suchgreat investments because it's aboutaccess to compute. That's, you know,this isn't hypothetical. It's alreadystarted. Export controls on high-endchips have tightened. Demand forNvidia's H100s is outstripping supply.It's been outstripped for a long, longtime. Jeypity or GPU rentals uh rentalcosts have surged in some cases,quadrupling when availability drops.These aren't market blips. They'rewarning signals. Every layer of theecosystem of this ecosystem fromOpenAI's API to Microsoft's copilot toindie rappers flooding your feed isbuilt on a supply chain that begins withone company manufacturing one kind ofhardware in one constrainted geography.That's not a stack. It's a fault line.It I mean this actually is a such a goodcall out, right? This is such a danggood call out on this one, which is thatthere is so much of our life that isdependent on a very fixed pipeline thatif any of this goes wrong, there's justthis giant slowdown. Like we forgetexactly how vulnerable we really are.You know, we are much more vulnerable todisruption than we realize. We have likeone Taiwanese company. This article is aroller coaster. This article is a rollercoaster. The black swan events thatcould uh change the AI economy. Thehardware choke. A disruption in Nvidia'ssupply chain, whether caused bygeopolitical tensions, raw materialshortage, or manufacturing slowdowns,would halt progress across the stack. NoGPUs, meaning no training, no inference,and no scale. Silicon uh is the oxygenof the ecosystem. The regulatory snap.If major government decides thatfoundational models are a nationalsecurity concern or public safety risk,regulation could shut down key parts ofthe AI pipeline. I'm still surprisedthis hasn't happened yet. Honestly, I'msurprised. I I guess I'm not toosurprised. In some sense, I'm supersurprised. In some sense, I'm notsurprised. My personal running theorywhy governments have haven't acted onthis is that the outcome of AI is sounknown and that if we were to halt theprogress of said AI China China will winand we don't know what they win. Mytheory is that the government is justcorrupt. I'm not I'm not convinced onthe corrupt thing. I don't know whatthey win but they win the the AI race.What whatever whatever the like whateverthe outcome, right? They can't fallbehind, right? So I that's like as faras I understand that is that is myrunning theory why the government hasn'twalked in and said hey wait a secondopen AI you've produced a lot of codethat has broken a bunch of licenses. Ithink we I think we're okay with like agiant class action lawsuit and we'regoing to take you down right like I'msurprised that hasn't happened becausethere's just massive amounts of problemsbut it seems like an arms race. It seethat's I mean to me that's what it seemslike. That's why we're not seeing thatuh one ruling one uh moratorwill probably do it. Europe willprobably be like, \"Hey, yeah, screw you.Screw you guys.\" Okay. Hey, screw youguys. This is what we want.And then it'll be uh everyone will belike, \"Well, we weren't producing modelsanyways in in Europe, so sorry. I willjust shut off your access.\" Right?That's that's where I think it's goingto end with them. They're going to makea stand, and they're going to make astand that doesn't help them. Oneruling, one moratorium, one complianceshift, and the infrastructure goes fromopen to constrained overnight. Thethreat isn't technical, it's political.This has always been a huge problem. Youknow, I remember way back at the day atNetflix, one of the biggest uh like oneof the the two big like obstacles forour future, this was back in like 2015,that uh the leadership used to say, waspirating and uh politics.One of those two things have moreability to hurt Netflixthan most other things cuz it wasn'tabout the competition. You know, youjust had to keep your head down. You hadto keep on working hard. you have tokeep on producing good content and weare winning. So it wasn't that it waslike will we be able to win pirating orwill pirating win right? Will piratingeffectively siphon away enough profitsto make the model like unusablebusiness-wise? Or B, will somegovernment just be like, \"No.\" And thenyou're just like screwed. The paradigmshift. Most destabilizing scenariosisn't collapse, it's irrelevance. Whatif someone builds a competitive modelwithout needing GPUs? What ifintelligence emerges from signal, notscale? What if a leaner, radicallydifferent architecture rewrites therules? A system wouldn't crash. It wouldjust get left behind. I mean, this isgoing to happen. There's going to beimprovements that are going to happen.That means our reliance on hardware willgo down. But our also the hardware'sability to process over the course ofthe next 10 years will increase by what32x. So we'll get 32x more powerfulhardware in the next 10 years along withuh what's it called? Probably betteralgorithms out there. So you probablyget what a 64x improvement in processingand inference. So it's going to getfaster. I mean things will get betterand you'll need less reliance on stuff,but then models will probably just getbigger. Uh the gold rush is the point.Every time a wave like this hits, thesame psychology takes over. People don'tchase opportunity. They chase belonging.They want to be a part of it. They wantto say they were there early, that theybuilt with AI, that they had launch, alanding page, and maybe a tech crunchmention. It's less about what's real andmore about what signals. It doesn'tmatter if the product is sustainable oreven useful. What matters is the optics,screenshots, traction charts, investordecks showing hockey stick growth curvesstaple to open AI's API. This is thesame playbook every gold rush. In the1800s, the miners mostly lost. The oneswho got rich sold shovels, lodging, anddenim. That's a Levi mention rightthere. The dot boom, it was the SuperBowl ads, the domain grabs. Now, it'sprompt rappers. Well, I mean, there'salso a bunch of companies that made itout of the dot bubble that are alsosuper super wealthy. So, it wasn't justthat. I mean, there was, you know,Amazon's like killing it. Now, it'sprompt rappers, fake demos, AIco-founders, and inflated headcount forwhat amounts to front-end skins on APIcalls. Most of the teams aren't tryingto build enduring businesses. They'retrying to look like they already havejust long enough to raise, get acquired,and catch the algorithm. This isn'tinnovation, it's theater, and most ofwhat you see is stage craft. All right.Well, there's still a lot more to thisarticle. And so, I'll let you guysfinish this uh article. There's still agood amount. It'll be linked in thedescription, but I I feel like I've kindof I've kind of got the summary that Ineed to get on this one. All the beejobs.Anyways, so it the the hypothesis to thearticle is very interesting and Iactually agree with a lot of thearticle. I the funny part is I've neveragreed so much and disagreed so muchwith an article ever in my lifetime.Like I'm fully convinced that it isabsolutely ripe that or right that mostof these startups that just purely arerappers on AI if they don't make anysort of change in the next two yearsthey will fade into irrelevance likethat is going to happen at some point. Ithink integration is is hyper important.The closer you get to where the work isdone, the better, right? Like GPTwrappers were or GPT was neat and all,but GPT inside VS Code is way neater.GPT is nice and all, but GTP on thecommand line is just way cooler. GPT inan email is just way better than it ison OpenAI. Like there the integrationwill just simply be Yeah, make itrelevant to my work. I know it's justthe closer you are to where the work isdone, the better it is. And that's whereI think you'll get a more enduringproduct. And so if you already have aproduct where there actually is a realplay, like I said, the hospitalitableone I think is like the best example ofthat where you already have peoplewriting, some people write literallyhundreds of messages to guests every dayin umin Airbnb stuff. So the ability to havesomething that can help generatehundreds of those messages where you'reonly tuning it, it probably makes agiant uh difference. So agents, I'm noteven talking about agents. Uh I'm justtalking about closer to where you work.If you can query chat jippy and have theresults applied to your code,which is just, you know, cursor, itdoesn't even have to be an agent. Thatthat already is much much better. Thatalready is a huge difference. Why is Xchat gone? Oh, I just got to I got to doit in assistant. That's already a gianta giant win. Obviously background agentsand all these things people seem toreally really like. I always have thesame problem with all these agents whichwhenever I use them and do stuff. Ialways find them just they they getstuff so wrong that I just I hate it andit makes me really frustrated and theneventually I have to rewrite stuffanyways and it doesn't avoid melearning. It just means that when I haveto learn I have to learn with a wholeproject scaffold. That's all it usuallymeans for me. I always it's like hey doyou want to read do you want to writethis now or do you want to rewrite itlater? Which one would you like to do?And then I always end up in the exactsame position. I'll rewrite it later.You just get me the UI up. You know,real talk, LLMs are just a way for me toavoid writing CSS. It's all I'm saying.If I could just avoid writing CSS, youknow what I mean? Like that's that's allI want to do with my life is just like,\"Hey, oh wait, you got you could writeme CSS. Hey, why don't you write thatCSS for me?\" Okay. Cuz I never want tosee it in my life. Oh, you want to useTailwind? Go for it. I don't even care.Right. What do you want to do? I don'teven care. Get it. Get out of there. Thename is I don't want to write CSSEN.",
    "summary": "The video argues that 99% of AI startups will fail by 2026, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble burst. It asserts many AI startups are simply \"LLM rappers\" – offering user-friendly interfaces on top of existing models like OpenAI's GPT, without significant proprietary technology or sustainable business models. The speaker argues these startups rely heavily on OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers for intelligence, and their core product is merely a user interface stapled to prompt pipelines. They lack robust intellectual property, competitive moats, and are easily replicable. The convenience they offer often masks the simplicity of directly using the underlying AI APIs, especially for technically proficient individuals.\n\nThe speaker highlights that many AI startups are burning cash to acquire premium users, essentially subsidizing OpenAI's growth while remaining vulnerable. Their dependence on OpenAI for distribution, coupled with thin moats and the possibility of OpenAI directly serving users, creates a fragile ecosystem. The video identifies key players like Nvidia (controlling hardware) and Microsoft (controlling infrastructure through Azure), and warns about potential disruptions like hardware shortages, regulatory changes, and paradigm shifts towards more efficient or independent AI models. \n\nDespite the pessimistic outlook, the speaker acknowledges that some AI-powered products, especially those deeply integrated into existing workflows and offering genuine value beyond simple API wrappers (like improved email templates or communication tools), are likely to survive. He stresses the importance of developing lasting products that users genuinely like and find useful, rather than solely relying on the AI label and superficial interfaces. The key takeaway is that simply being an \"AI rapper\" is not a viable long-term strategy; startups need to offer unique value, strong moats, and robust products to avoid becoming another statistic."

That'sone of the things I've done. I've done alot of things in my career. Yes. You'veworked on silo DB. You you've beenaround DBs once or twice in yourlifetime and very difficult timeproblems as you once told me over someuh very good Brazilian mojitos. Yeah,that's right. Yes. Yeah. He brought youto Brazil. So all the Brazilians outthere that this is the guy to thankreally. It was actually Globber's fullidea and their team fully executed it.It was only Globber. And I told I toldthe team, look, you know, just theprimogen just tweeted the word Braziland got like 160,000 billion impressionson Twitter. Now we are remote company atTurso. We're all remote and then we haveto meet somewhere once a year. And thenI I told it, you know what we should do?we should just go to Brazil and bringPrime with us. Uh and then we of coursewe had help. We had we had Azon. We hadother you know partners that help us tomake that happen. But it was it was agreat this year we're going to Turkey bythe way if you want to come. Turkey. Wehave we have a Russian national in theteam and he is very limited uh aboutplaces he can go. So, well, uh, one ofthe interesting things with yourbackground and some of the stuff thatyou know and, uh, some of the thingsPrime has lately been, uh, reacting tois all of this Rust for Linux stuff.Prime, maybe you want to give a quick,uh, background on sort of thedevelopments here and the current stateof things for people who don't know. Andthen I'm pretty interested to getGlobber's take on what's going on there.All right. So, generally, Alinus hassaid that he's optimistic or uh, curiousto see where Rust inside the Linuxkernel is going to go. So, so over thelast couple years there's been a lot ofeffort put into bringing Rust in moreand more into the development cyclesinto the builds uh into the staging andso as of recently some notablecontributors have resigned and a lot ofit comes down to kind of the conflict ofworking with the C developers and Ibelieve if I were to give it the mostcharitable take the difficulty that Isee among all the mailing list threadsis that there is not like a clear anddefinitive answer as to what is theexpectation of development with rust.Should rust belong inside these coremodules or should it purely be a proxyon the outside? You have to constantlymaintain the churn from within or shouldyou not be able to even produce a patchwithout all the rust builds successfullybuilding or can the rust builds breakeven on the builds? And so there's beenno clear direction there I believe ifI'm giving the most charitable readhere. And so there's just it appearsthere's a lot of confusion which isleading to a lot of fighting which isleading to people quitting and there'splenty of other problems but that wouldprobably be the nicest way. And soyou've obviously been on thecontributing side and probably thereviewing side and probably have senthundreds of Linux kernel mailing listmessages. Thousands. Yeah. Thousands.What is the kind of your take on thesituation? Yeah. So you know and just toclarify uh I I don't contribute to Linuxanymore in a while. I actually Iactually kept even after I was at Silauh occasionally I would find a bug in inyou know some driver or something thenthen then I would fix it but likeespecially now like as the founder of acompany I have very little time foreverything that's not like core to whatI'm doing so I don't contribute to Linuxdirectly for a while but when I look atdiscussions and and the other day I sawyour the video of you reacting to to apresentation that somebody gave aboutRust for Linuxvery little I think changed right so soI think the first thing that people haveto understand about the Linux communityuh sorry can I interrupt one second justto give the proper context it was aboutlike what six months ago that I did thisand it was a presentation where someonewas talking about uh Rust and they gotto like slide two of a 50 slidepresentation and the entire hour wasjust spent arguing over slide one twoand three so they got nowhere andapparently this is very normal regularyour comment your comment on the streamwas like, \"Look, they they can't evenlet the guy finish.\" And then what Itexted you immediately, it's like,\"Look, this was this is so pervasive inLinux that the first time that I went toa conference that wasn't a Linuxconference, I was actually flabbergastedthat people would just go through theirslides as it felt weird. I mean,because you have to understand like Istarted my career in the Linux car. Thatwas the first job I've ever had. Thatwas the first open source project that Iever participated in. uh and everysingle presentation like every singleconference was just like people fightingall the time. I I tell the story thatlike the first contribution that I hadto the Linux kernel uh was some fix fortheext3 file system at the time uh ext4 wassuper new. So you know ex ext3 filesystem might even have been ext2. Uhthat was in 2004 like so there was thefirst first time I officiallycontributed to the Linux kernel and wewere all we we all saw those guys inLinux as like demigods right uh and andI knew their names. I would follow themailing list and and you know we wouldread stuff about them. Uh and I rememberthat I sent this thing. It was very itwas a very emotional moment to me. Itwas like I sent I sent coach to theLennis Colonel. Uh, and then I see theemail popping up as a response allviral. It was one of those guys that,you know, I've only heard about and Ihad this dream like one day I want tomeet this guy. Uh, and then he had heresponds that uh, I've never seen codethis bad in my life. Uh,this you you managed to introduce threenew bugs in two new lines of code andpeople like you should never be allowedto get close to a keyboard again. Uh sothat that was my introduction to Linuxand and I started you know after after awhile I think I got a little bit betterI I I started introducing like one bugin one in in three lines of code andthen maybe zeroat like GitHub co-pilot speeds right nowyou know exactly you know so at somepoint you know and then I startedworking at Red Hat I started doing likerelevant stuff and then we we would goto the conferences and the conferencesare all like that like somebody sayssomething and then there's a flame warabout that something and and and it goesliketo your point, the Linux community is avery organic community. So, so likepeople don't not say things if if ifsomething crosses your mind and and thediscussions in the mailing list if youfollow the discussions like they go intotangents all the time and then somebodysays this one thing and people startdiscussing like that one thing and itgoes in wild directions. So what you'resaying about Russ for Linux doesn'tsurprise me, right? This thing about ohthere's no clear direction.Yes, I I I will be very surprised if ifthere was any clear direction in inanything. And and look, it kind ofworks. It it kind of works because likeLinux is an undoubt undoubtfully asuccess, right? Just so so uh there isno other uh open source project that isas successful at Linux, you know,depending on the metrics. Uh that's aclear, you know, there's clearly no opensource project that is as successful asLinux. So that that wild mess kind ofworks. Uh so look I I wouldn't Iwouldn't expect uh clear directions fromfrom anybody. Uh it's more like yeahthings are organically evolving that wayand and and Linux Linux spoiled me in inin a lot of ways because of this becausewhen I when I when I started working atSila for example I had this idea and Iand and I swear I didn't do it onpurpose but I kind of had this idea thatyeah I mean you don't have to test yourcode that well. I mean, you test it, butyou don't have to test your code thatwell because what happens is that youyou send you you you know, you send youryour code and it gets even if it getsmerged, 3 days later, you're going tohave 40,000 people commenting on it,right? And and I associate and Iassociated that with like how opensource works, but you know, it's not howopen source works, it's how Linux worksbecause everything you do has like10,000 people looking at it andscrutinizing from every single angle.So, you kind of get lazy in a way. So, Imean, I got spoiled by that. Uh, but youknow, you just have to think of Linux asthis massive community with likeliterally tens of thousands of peopledoing stuff all the time. And it's it'svery hard for anybody to have like cleardirections on the plan. I mean, I don'tI don't think there is a plan, right, atthe end of the day.But I mean, I love that idea that youcan commit stuff and people will justtell you immediately when you're wrong.It's the greatest CI of all time becausenot only is it wrong, they're probablysuper motivated. They open up the code,look at the patch, they're like, \"Youlook at this line right here. Who wrotethis garbage? You wrote this garbage.What was wrong actually is that you wentto do cast it.\" And you're just like,\"Oh, yeah. Of course.\" Thank you. Thankyou for that. Thank you. ThankAndrew Martin. Yeah. Andrew AndrewMartin. I've seen other people sayingsimilar things. I mean, I'm not evenclaiming I he invented that. I'm justclaiming I heard first from him. AndrewMorton at the time was like the when Iwas at the peak of my contributions, hewas the second in command for for Linux.Again, I don't know if it if that'sstill the case. Uh, and one day he toldme like, look, if if if you're notgetting responses to your your code,just send something wrong, right?Because becausesome sometimes people set likequestions, you know, should I should Igo this direction? I mean, I have this,you know, I'm maybe we should pursuethings this way or that way. And thenand then like sometimes people comment,sometimes people don't. And what he saidis like just code something wrong andand send it to them, you know, becausethat people will comment, right? uh andand you know it's just the kind ofpersonality I think that gets attractedto Linux and you know Giri has chargeduh people who really like to nerd snipeon things and and and go really reallydeep into into this one thing and andand it has this consequence like yes youkind of unear the the craziest bugsbecause people working on Linux and thatwas always been the case are reallyreally really good which again it's notit's something that I didn't appreciateuntil much later in in my career likehow how you're working like in a quoteunquote normal team with normal people.You don't have that like if you'reworking on the Linux kernel likewhatever you do and and you get muchbetter by the way. So if if you canstomach for for the people who are inthe beginning of their career, oneadvice I have just go work on Linux, youknow, because you're going to be more ifif you develop the thick skin of of, youknow, learning to live with that, it'sit was great for me, you know, uh andit's going to be great for you, too. Butbut as a consequence of that, I thinkthings a lot more organic than thanyou're used to, right? Things are a lothigher level in in skill level than thanyou used to. Look, I I worked for DataDog for a year and you know, Data Dog isa public company. It's a great company.They have amazing technology. But thatwas the first time in my life that Ilook around and I saw that, you know,I'm surrounded by normal people, right?Because the Silla folks were also anoffshoot of of of the same group that weworked with in in the Linux kernel. Uhand so so you know, just it's it's avery wild environment. uh it's a veryhigh intensity environment but also Ithink that the the other side of that isthat there is no direction forget aboutit right just and a lot of people end upleaving yeah a lot of people end upleaving like they say I don't know thisthose people right specifics right butthe case for me is that at some point Ialso got tired of of all the fightingright just after 10 years it takes atoll on you right so so it might havebeen I mean I ventured you guessed itthere might have been a component ofthat as well, right, Justin?I I I absolutely love that. Um, my time,the early days of working at Netflix hada very similar vibe in the sense thatI'd make a I'd make a change, no onewould really comment on it. I'd merge itin and then I'd be pulled aside by likethe old guard and be thoroughly chewedout about like, look at this ininefficiency. You know, we wereprogramming JavaScript at that time, butit was embedded JavaScript that we handkind of rolled into TVs. So like everylast allocation mattered and they werejust so upset that an object was createdper click and we had to like have a longdiscussion about how this was happeningand all. I was just like this is this isjust such a different experience justhaving this kind of like kind of freeworld to do whatever you want. But themoment like it actually got out therethen people just like clobbered it andbrought it down. And it was pretty f itwas actually a really great environmentand I probably learned the most becauseof that freedom to hang yourself butalso the freedom to uh or also theresponsibility of your co-workers tokind of like uplevel you even if it isin a little bit of a harsh way. But I dowant to I do want Oh, go on. I was justgoing to comment that the equivalent ofthat for us was essentially like whatkind of code would the compilergenerate? Uh it was some it wassomething like he he would do somethingand and then somebody uh and I have avery specific person in mind because hewas the king of that Peter uh PeterZustra the the guy from the he was oneof the maintainers at the time of the ofthe scheduler. Uh and again thescheduler really is a place where all ofthat matters. You're like fighting aboutcach line orientation and and andalignment and he would come at you andsay don't write the code this waybecause the comp the GCC is not great atgenerating code with this pattern. youshould write the code this other waybecause then if and then you go look atit's kind of true. So I learned a lotabout how compilers work just working onon Linux because you really have tounderstand you know for for you youwrite code this way the compiler tendsto generate code this other way rightjust to that sounds like a just aconstant losing battle by the way havingto try to guess or try to stay ahead ofcompiler changes on such a large projectto be like well new optimization justdropped boys let's get back to thatcompiler start rewriting stuff. Yeah,you know, there's there is a there's atrick for that which is autism. I mean,I'm not diagnosing anybody here, butlike I I think, you know, in ourindustry in general, there's a highprevalence of that and and I I getguilty as charge as well, but it itdefinitely it definitelyhelps to to stay ahead of the curve. So,so quick I I want you to kind of maybetalk a little bit more about Rustbecause you obviously with Terso haveleaned in heavily on Rust. you'rerewriting SQLite with Rust and thiswhole Rust for Linux thing. How do youthink there's a successful future forRust in the Linux kernel and and is thisjust a matter of attrition and waitingfor old hands to leave the Linux kerneland the currently young which will soonbe old hands in the Linux kernelmaintaining a 20-year wait to get uh youknow rust in? Is that the strategy orlike what what is the what's the playhere? I yeah I I am optimistic and andyou know first of all I like rust a lotand and I think uh the rust folks thatcontributing to Linux are doing in theright way uh because there's also I meanI I just described this environmentwhere like everybody's a super geniusbut there is a lot of garbage code inthe Linux kernel as well uh and thatcode tends to be in drivers because whathappens with drivers is is exactly likelook you as the maintainer don't quiteunderstand how that works because it'slike this graphic card that you know Idon't even have the specs for uh and andand you know just part of that is justwriting code. to writing code is, youknow, it's always the same like alsolike nobody truly cares. I I wrote codefor the core of the Linux kernel most ofof my career was things like theuler,file systems, you know, memorymanagement, resource allocation. So youwrite bugs and this kind of things. Yes.like 10,000 people will notice like justa somebody runs your code and noticeslike like I remember happened many timesthe day after my workload got 20% slowerand you know then then they get bisackto your patch and they send you an angryemail and say just the gloss just mademy my computer 20% slower and then yougo figure out a real story uh and thenyou go figure out why but in driversnone of that happens because first ofall nobody's running that stuff just aperson and Linux has always had thispolicy like we want to support everypiece of hardware out there. So there'sthere many pieces of hardware that likefour people in the world have access touh and and you know it's not somethingthat people care about that deeply. Soyou end you end up having a lot of youknow substandard code in in in drivers.Uh and this is exactly uh from myunderstanding what the rust for Linuxfolks are trying to do like let's writedrivers with this like nobody's pushingnecessarily you know let's rewritetheuleruh with with rust is like you know c ifwe have a memory safe language can wemake the situation at the margins of ofthe Linux kernel a little bit betterwhich I think is a great strategy andlook with I I don't think you need Idon't need I don't think you need theold guard to die out uh this this what'shappening sounds very ominous in thesense of people are leaving and likethere's this but this happened in theLinux kernel all the time I mean I can Ican remember fiveexamples you know easily on my headwhere people called an idea and andagain people are very harsh so called anidea like complete [ __ ] the worstthing I've seen in my life even Linuxgets involved and say only stupid peoplewill do this and and uh and and thenfive years later everybody's on boardyou know because people are also veryrational. So, so I think if if if Rustproves itself, it will face a lot ofopposition, which again I think is itit's it's harsh. It's hard to deal with.It takes a toll on you, but when whenyou look at the at the health of theproject, it's actually not bad becauseif you manage to win the battle, youhave something really solid at the otherend, right? So, and again, one exampleis the first thing I work withvirtualization. Linus Dvolds himself wascompletely against it. uh he said thingsat the time he said things like over mydead body Linux will ever supportvirtualization because that's a stupididea I don't see the value on it and andetc and etc and etc time and time andtime again um it's there you know everyLinux kernel today is also moonlight asa hypervisor another example I owe youring something that that you know I Ididn't work in the kernel too much Ifixed a couple of bugs but I used it asa user at sila and and and now uh limbouh Our new project at Turso alsosupports that. I've I used that at datadog and it and it's essentially Linosvothimself was very against the idea ofasynchronous system calls as a genericconstruct and then I ring came and andyou know did it in a way that wasacceptable uh and and now it's there. Sothere are many examples uh of thingsthat the community was viscerally andyou know brutally against and then youfast forward five years and everybody'son board. So uh my my hope is that thesame will happen for Russ for Linux. Itwill prove you know organic it may nothappen but I think what you will see isthat you're going to see this organicdevelopment. Uh people end up findingsolutions for their problems. Somepeople die along the way. Uh I Iremember you know that was in 2005 whenthe Linux 2.6 was coming out there wasthis one implementation from this guycalled Conivus. Uh he was a virtuoso. Hewrote like tons and tons and tons ofcode for the Linux kernel. Uh and he wastrying to prove that this the thespecific type of scheduler that he waswriting was superior to what Linux had.Eventually he got tired. He quit. Uh buthis ideas lived on and three yearslater, Lyn, you know, Ingo uh adoptedexactly the scheduler that this guy waspushing. So it happened time and timeagain. It it's not anything new. I thinkthat's what's going to happen with Rust.Uh I think Rust has a bright future. Andif it I if if it truly has, in threeyears, in 5 years, we're going to behaving a very different discussion.People are going to be on board. Thereis always the one person, the two peoplethat you know that people are stillshit-talking systemd years later asthere was like the worst development andyou know that's fine life goes on. Uh soyou have to abstract away the theviolence a little bit and and and theneverything makes sense. Yeah it is. Imean it is super common in just like anyopen source project to have a bunch ofthis stuff here. I remember when I wasworking on bringing LSP into Neoim, likepeople were pretty excited about it.Like I worked on it for a while and thenI like switched jobs and I didn't havetime to work on it so I stopped and thenlike someone else picked it up and thenthey had to stop and someone else pickedit up and then they finally merged itand then I also happened to come back bythen. I was at a different job again andI had a bunch of time to work on it andthen it's like now it's there. It's useda bunch. Everybody uses, right? So, it'slike it's a pretty common thing just inopen source that people for variousreasons like decide that they're notgoing to go and it's not always likesome mysterious flame war with politicalsubtext or something like that.Sometimes it's just like well I'm kindof tired.It well it it does happen but the tirein that case I mean this guy inparticular was very passionate and andhe just got tired of of of the violencein in a sense because I mean Lin Linuxis a very violent community it truly isand uh what what what happened uhverbally violent right I want to clarifythat I've never seen I've never seen anyyou know justmight have happened I'm not saying thatit never happened maybe at one of theconferences they were like I reallywanted to get to slide four guys I'mabout to beat you guys up if I don't getto slide for if it happened if ithappened it didn't happen to me or or inany situation that I was a part of butyou know just the verbal violence isdefinitely there uh and and you know atsome point you get tired and and and Ithink it was one of the factor itwouldn't was not the thing but it wasone of the things that led me to lookaround and say maybe I want to dosomething else now after 10 years ofthis I mean it gets tiring but here'sthe thing uh I'm running a startup todayright and and and a lot a lot in thestartup world uh people have those thoseterms of like product market fit and andand this and that and like how how doyou know like doing things is nothard figuring out what to do is the hardpart like doing things is easy comparedto figuring out what to do and what hasvalue what what doesn't have value andin a sense what you just describedproves that what you were doing hadvalue because you stopped doing it andsomebody else picked up right so so so II think the Linux kernel ends up beinglike this filter because look there arepeople doing stuff all the time andthere are people fighting all the timeand there are people dropping all thetime. the things that survive are thethings that have value at the end of theday because he had to survive thisprocess of like people bickering andfighting uh and and if it's just a fadlike sometimes it took me there was oneparticular piece of work that I wasdoing that it took me a year and a halfto get in from that's when I met Pekkaby the way and it's mostly his fault andit's why sometimes I have this lovehaterelationship with him because you knowjust but but you know Pekka being myco-founderat it It was a something that I had thepatches ready to go. I I worked it on onI worked on it for two months and then Ihad an idea of you know that that worksand it had me it took me a year and ahalf to get this merge into the Linuxcut right if it's something that doesn'thave value beyond like threemonths this work dies right so it itit's a sifting process to find out likewhat truly has value what tr what trulyworks what what truly should be here uhor not so you know just uh It's a it's ait's a beautiful process at the end ofthe day. It it can be taxing but it's abeautiful process I think. Is it do youthink it's the ideal process in thesense that when you read through thestuff it is a bit harsh of feedback orat least perhaps it's harsh based on myjust view of the world at this pointjust because I've been kind of I guessI'm not sure the proper word I'll justcall playgroundized uh for my for mycode feedback right which is you shouldnever say anything negative it shouldalways be like you know all those thingsthat kind of go in is it an ideal formdo you think there's things that couldimprove and do people quit uh because ofhow negative it is or is it just simplybecause of how slow it is? No, I'venever seen anybody uh quitting ofbecause of how slow the process is, youknow, just and in in fact as I said I Igot very spoiled because for me likesoftware development was in Linuxthere's no sense of urgency for anythingfor anything because it's always likelook we're going to find the bestsolution right just there's no argu likenobody ever makesarguments and again I worked at Red Hatfor for seven eight years out of the 10years that I was in the colonel and inthe company you have this idea of likehey look we we need we have thiscustomer issue we need to do somethingabout it and and and etc. But Red Hatwas a company that understood this verywell which is why they were sosuccessful. This argu you know thiskinds of arguments just don't fly in theLinux kernel because the way you know itdidn't evol it didn't start as acompany. It evolved as as like thisgroup of people doing things right andand you show up there and you say likewe're going to do this because I have10,000 customers in my company that thatneed this like the answer like it'sgoing to start with the it's the f word.It's really like I don't care. like whyare you even saying this like so sothere's no sense of urgency for anythinglike people send code uh and and theresponse you're going to get is like isthis the best is this not the best isthis the best direction and sometimesyou know Ican one time I I wanted to do somethingfairly fairly small in thex8664 architecture so it was somethingthe boot sequence and and I sent the youknow it took me a week and a half to towrite the code I sent this to themaintainer at the time. His responsewas, \"When I think about it, I actuallydon't see a reason anymore for the x86,the 32-bit version uh of the code andx8664 to be two differentimplementations. They should be the sameimplementation.\" Uh so, so this yes, youwant this thing that took you one weekto do merge into the Linux kernel.before I accept that I want you tocompletely rewrite the boot sequence forboth processors to be the same. Mhm. Andand like there's no sense and if youdon't want to do it then you don't wantto do it like you know that's fine thenbut but I'm not going to merge the scorebecause I think it's moving us in thewrong direction. The right direction isthat those two trees should be the same.M uh and then I spent another and Ispent a year and a half uh merging thetwo trees together for me by the way wasfantastic because I learned so muchabout all sorts of you know things uhand okay now that I did a year and ahalf of work I can go back to that weekproject that I have and then merge itin. So there's no sense of urgency butbut in a in a sense I mean it's actuallypretty awesome because you don't havethose pressures like there's no pressurefor compromise but what I saw manypeople leaving for is you know theharshness that that that is somethingthat I think pushes a lot of people awayand um is is it the ideal process Ithink if we could have the process ofLinux without the harshness uh then Ithink it would be much better uh soobviously you know I think it will bemuch better. I don't know if you canthough. I mean, being being quite honestbecause it's it's it's one of thosethingslike we some some if people dance toomuch around things, what what ends uphappening is that you bury the truth,right? Mhm. Uh because you you you youyou think something but you can't reallysay it because it's not the way. And Ithink I think this this harshness thatyou see in Linux is just a result ofpeople being very direct all the time.This is what Inow you could do this without callingpeople morons and and and some peopledo. I mean there are some people in theLinux kernel by the way there are somepeople that are fantastic. I mean AndrewMorton is one of them. Like I neverscreamed at anybody. Pekka neverscreamed at anybody that you know Pekkacan be a little bit rough sometimes butnever at this like this uh uh Yens Expothe guy from IO ring is a fantastic guy.Uh Greg was Greg Crow Hartman was likewas always a a very welcoming person. Soyou have those kinds of people with within the Linux community that so it'spossible todo but you know it it Linux attracts akind of people that usually doesn't havethis this level of self-awareness andand and so so in practice I don't knowif you know I would love to see it I Ithink if they if if Linux can evolve toa point where we can resolve thosedisputes by telling the truth withoutyou know telling people that you wouldprefer that they never get close to akeyboard again. I think it would be anet win for the community and I hopethey get there. I just But it's easiersaid than done. I think that's whatthat's my point. I just Yeah. I thinkthere's two difficult like sides of ittoo. There's the the other side is Ithink a lot of people when they receivedirect feedback, it's like just as harshif it says like one mildly criticalthing as as it would be harsh for themto receive as like, \"F you. You're sodumb. you should never touch a keyboard.those are equivalent like the way thatthey feel about getting that feedback isthe same which also like makes it verydifficult to have the conversation cuzsometimes you're like I all I said was Ithink we should do it different like whyis why is that person so upset right sothere is also you know sort of this thisflip side too of people need to come youknow prepared to have any kind offeedback and I don't necessarily seepeople always like being really wellprepared for that either. So even in theideal world, everyone somehow figuresout how to give direct feedback withoutcalling names. A lot of people stillaren't ready to receive the directfeedback anyways. And and it's somethinglike remember like you know I rememberyou weren't there. Neither was I.You have those things today likesometimes somebody posts a exam fromfifth grade in 1965 and like this supercomplex stuff that that just today'slike college level math. Uh so there'ssomething to be said about the bar aswell, right? So so so yeah, I mean youdon't call people names which by the waya lot of people just get used to. It'sjust not my personality because I'm I'ma friendly person.uh and and then you moved to just directeven if you could enforce it because youknow that's the hard part even if youcould enforce it. Yeah. The bar is now alittle bit lower and now people starttaking offense to the direct feedback,right? It's just so that that's what Ithink in practice it it's hard. Uh it Idon't think it's the ideal development.Uh but I think it's the developmentthat's been working for for for Linux ina sense, right?Speaking of open source projects, youknow, with trying to grab a lot ofdifferent contributors and and workingsort of all over the world on a reallydifficult thing. I'm interested in someof the experience you've been having uhwith your I I guess it really can becalled a SQLite rewrite, right? Thatwould probably be the the proper term inlimbo. But maybe before we jump directlyto there, uh you could talk just realquick for some people who don't know howyou got to the place where it makessense to do a SQLite rewrite because itsounds pretty insane uh off the rip.Well, you know, it's a insane is notnecessarily a bad word. So, I'll takeit. But uh but you know in the Linux oneof the things that we alwayswanted m maybe we can go to I can go totherapy here with you guys right justI'll lay down I have my couch rightthere you know it could it could be justyou know back and I always wanted tohave this experience of the Linux kernelagain right so you know maybe we'remasochists we like to suffer but butwell without the violence right so thatThat's the that's the you know the thegold standard like can we do this and uhwe two around two years ago we we knowwe love SQLite is you know whichofficially I've been calling Squeitemostly because of Brian you're welcomewhich I I think it's a it's a greatpronunciation but we love we love it Ithink it's a great database a databasethat that goes everywhere and I you knowI don't come from this web background uhup until very recently I never touchedJavaScript in my life. Do not know howhappy I was. Uh and and so so SQLite hasthis appeal of like a database that runsin embedded devices. It runs in in youknow it works everywhere. It runs on onon military fleets and and and whatnot.Um and and I want to be careful withthat because I sometimes I get flamed onX for two reasons. First because I thinkpeople just like it. you know, it's parttalking about Linux, you know, it's it'ssomething human about us. People justlike fighting. People say they don't,but we really do. Um,so but the reason I sometimes get flameis that it people understand that I'mattacking the SQLite development model.Uh, which I'm not. Okay, this is whatI've tried to make it always very clear.So what is the SQLite development modelfor those who don't know? Because a lotof people actually claim that they didnot know this. Solite is a project thatis called open source but not opencontribution. So they don't accept yourcode. They just don't. Uh it it ismaintained by three people. Uh and thatis the SQLite community of developers soto speak, right? Um so the test SQLiteis known to be like probably the moststable piece of software in the world.They're maniacal about like gettingeverything tested thoroughly tested, youknow, but the test suit is proprietary.So, so you can't really if you makechanges to SQL, you can't really test ituh your your changes.And I don't I'm not saying that there issomething like immoral about this whichis you know what some people sometimesunderstand or or fundamentally wrong butI do think that that's not how I wouldrun a project. Uh and I do think thatthe idea that some people have that thisis the only reason why SQLite is greatbecause it's kept you know the the onlyway to make something great is if youonly have three people doing this andyou know if you take this away thatwon't work anymore. I think this isfundamentally false and the data pointthat I have for this is Linux againbecause Linux started as Linux startedas this you know very small if you readthe the letter that Linux originallywrote it's like yeah this is a toyproject this will never work outside ofmy computer and look where it is todayuh and well you know it it would getbloated right SQLite would get bloatedif you hadcontributors no because again Linuxworks in supercomputers and he works onembedded devices and it workseverywhere. So I mean it is it ispossible to do and and Pekka and I havethe experience to to do it. Uh so wealways wanted to create like a whatcould SQLite be becauseyou you give something away like thecreativity that comes with Linux withthis organic thing the community comingup with like this thing that you neverimagined something would ever do andthen one day this person shows up anddoes it. uh you know I remember thefirst time I read about KXAC. KXAC issomething that was essentially a way uhthat this guy Eric found out uh toreboot your kernel into another kernel,right? So, so it is insane what what hehas done and then he started peoplestarted using this to essentially likeif it crashes you you if the Linuxkernel crashes it it boots it into the Kexact kernel and then I can extract acore dump from a kernel right so so andlike I nobody ever thought this waspossible to do this one day this dudeshows up and does it right uh so youknow this wasn't on anybody's plan thiswasn't on anybody's road map you know soyes I May maybe you don't have theviolence just there there are advantagesmaybe granted you know of keeping thingssmall but you lose in this creativityyou you lose in this idea of like heyyou know people coming and contributingand doing crazy stuff. Um so we wantedto recreate this with with Sikolai. say,\"Hey, we love Sikolai, but what if whatif we could have a open contributionversion of Solite?\" That was the dreamfor us. That that was like the, youknow, what we wanted to do. Where couldwe take this thing and two years ago wewe looked at this problem andand there's a a lot of that is like alot of people are talking about. I thinkpeople are rediscovering SQLite. SQLiteis a database that we always love thatwe always, you know, used in in in inmany ways. So we had this idea, what ifwe fork SQLite instead? What what if wefork SQLite, right? Just and and andjust run withthat. The argument against the fork isusually when you fork, you fragment thecommunity. But but in our mind is likethere is no community. So, so, sothere's nothing to fragment and and uhwe we're going to fork it because thenwe don't have to worry about maintainingcompatibility and we can start from froma base and and and we we can go fromthere and that's what we did. So, twoyears ago, we forked because of that.But in the back of our mind, what wewanted to do mostly because it's fun wasto rewrite it, right? And and we thoughtwe were being like the adults in theroom. Yeah. It's so fun to rewrite it.But but and and and I guess the lessonhere is like unleash your inner childsometimes, you know, because the resultsare better sometimes. Prime's prettygood at that. Yeah. Yeah. And when itworks, it works, man. And we wanted torewrite we we we figure, look, look, arewrite in Rust or Zig. We we we look atboth languages. Uh will be fantastic. Uhit will be super fun to do. I think itcan take us very far but we kind ofdecided to fork it instead because ofthis is you don't lose too much byforking you know there's no communityandand but over time it it started to feelthat maybe it wasn't the right decisionlike technically and and and I think alarge part of that a large part of thatis the fact that it's very hard to testyour changes because the test suitforite is proprietaryuh and also again I'm I'm going to saythis on the most charitable way posspossible. Coolite is a great end resultpiece of software. But when you'rewriting software for yourself thatnobody else will ever contribute, youwrite things in a specific way. Uh andwhen when you write code like for Linuxwhere where you expect people to comeand contribute, you you write softwarein a completely different way becausereadability, maintainability, and andthings like that are a part of yourdecision-making process. And when whenyou're writing code just for yourself,it's a it's a different thing. AndSQLite is like that, right? So so makingchanges to SQLite to the SQLitearchitecture like there's no modularitylike things cross boundaries all thetime. It's very hard to understand thechanges that you're making and how theythey impact the and then the test suitis proprietary. We added a lot offeatures to to to our fork called lipSQL but it was very very hard to makefoundational changes and and and then westarted playing with the idea of arewrite right so what happened is thatin December uh in December2024 it got to the point that it canread data from SQLite just fine uh mostqueries work uh you can't write data nowyou can but without transactions but butthe project started just really as aside project that that we were playingwith like we we didn't have any likeTorso as a company didn't havenecessarily an idea to use it. It was asa side project if it works sure I meanin a couple of years we we we might useit for instead of what we have today.But in December 2024 we announced itthat we had this idea because it it wassomething that was just Peka and Italking about it and a couple of otherpeople who showed up. This was on hisGitHub repository. It wasn't even on thetorso GitHub repository or notorganization, not repository. Mhm. Andlook, the results were wild, man. Theresults were wild. Uh we had 8,000GitHub stars in less than a month. Uh wehad we have now 87 contributors to theproject. 87 contributors to the project.So, and again remember for us this wasall this attempt like can we recreatethis community of contributors and thiscreativity of like people showing up anddoing crazy things that we haven'tthought about is already happening.Yeah. Right. There there is this thisdude you know I I I I don't know how topronounce his name. Uh it's uh so I'mnot going to even try not not to butcherit but he's coming and and like doinglike very interesting work uh in thesimulator specifically. I'm going totalk more about the simulator that it'snot work that we we thought about doingand he's improving a lot the way wesimulate right and and it's notsomething that wasn't on anybody's roadmap. We have this guy in prison uh whichI recently learned is not the same asjail uh that that that came and startedlike doing tremendously goodcontributions. Uh other people and andso we're starting to form uh thiscommunity which is what we truly trulywanted our and when we ask those peoplewhy are you spending your time on this?What we hear time and time again is thatlook, we all agree with with your ideaof lib SQL, the fork, the SQL, I can bemore, that we can do more, but you know,this is the stuff that excites me likethe the a full rewrite the blank canvas,the the the opportunity to just doeverything from scratch.That is what excite that. So, so the wayI've been describing is like with thisanalogy for from chemistry likeactivation energy with lip SQL the forkthe reaction almost happened but itdidn't quite got you the activationenergy and with the rewrite like it itreally did. Uh so so I mean we we wecan't use it in our product todaybecause it's not it's not ready rightjust yeah but but we made a lot ofchanges to the company to allow us tohave the the mind space and the and theresources to really which is essentiallylike anything else that we had on theroad map for this year cut it drop it oror modify it. uh and and we need to putpeople uh to and and and yet yet withoutus contributing to the project again wehave 87 contributors week after week wehave more and more and more commitsbecause the community is really coming.So what we think what we think we can dois like get this project which is like adatabase that can run everywhere.Database that can run on your headset onyour toaster on on airplanes. Hopefullynot the airplane in Toronto that thatjust flipped upside down but you knowjust a uh everywhere and and get acommunity of people to run with the samelevel of quality that SQLite has for forus. This is the important part right? Ifit doesn't have the same level ofquality that SQLite has, then nobody'sgoing to use it. Because people useSQLite, not because it's fancy, butbecause you can trust it. And the waywe're doing this is throughdeterministic simulation testing, whichI know prime is is something that youenjoy a lot, which is I love the idea ofit, which is it's actually extremelydifficult to really execute well. That'swhy I'm so interested in what you'redoing. And and again we even if we'renot doing well this dude is came and andand and he is doing and and and I knowhe's associated with a university and Iknows him a lot better uh you know justand might be you know might be becausehe's interested from his thesis or or orwhatn not I don't know but this is thekind of people you attract and this iswhat we want to do. Uh and the idea ofdeterministic simulation testing isessentially how to code with no bugsright in in a way it's not it's not thatthere are no bugs but you you have afuzzer attached to a simulator and thesimulator makes abstracts all the IOeverything that in the system that couldbenondeterministic timing interrupts uhevents uh IO like a data returning fromfrom storage sometimes it takes longersometimes it t It takes right and and inevery system you you start having thosevery weird interactions like oh this bugonly happens when the disk is nearlyfull and then appsync took a little bitlonger and like you have all of thosebugs and then in the simulator with afuzzer you can simulate all of thosescenarios. So hundreds of years ofexecution in one day and if it fails sothe bugs are there. So it's not that youdon't have bugs but when it fails youyou can reproduce every single stepexactly leading you to that point. Mhm.Uh so you you take that the the crazyreasoning about like cuz that's how wedid it in Linux by the way like thosethings would happen like there is ascheduler bug you have to spend like aweek reasoning about how okay so maybewhat happened is that like this thismemory got access when this other thinghappened it takes a week just to come upwith a theory and with deterministicsimulation testing if a bug happens youyou you know exactly like you canreproduce this exactly to to everysingle step. Uh so the bugs are therebut you find them quickly and and yousolve them very quickly and we thinkthis is what can be the replacement tothe mythical SQLite test suit rightinteresting. So, how how do you knowthat you're like I guess when it comesto this simulation testing, you'reattempting to do everything is truly thefuzzer the thing that you're relying onthe most or what makes it so that youhave such a high degree of confidencewith simulation testing, you're not justcategorically missing huge chunks thatyou just don't even know about, right?Like the unknown unknowns ofdevelopment. Yeah. Yeah. So, so yeah, soit's mostly on the fuzz on the fuzzer,right? and and on the fact that that youhook into the IO subsystemuh because the the the things that youwant to simulate so first of all the wayyou verify the system is throughproperty testing so it's not like youwrite a unit test and you expect thisresult is like those are the propertiesof the system that need to home right soso you know more or less right just whatthe if something happens that doesn'tkeep those properties there's a bugRight. So, and then you go investigatethe bug. Uh it's it's less it's lessdirect than a unit test. When a unittest fails, you know exactly oh okaythat this thing here is exactly whatfail. Uh this should be zero now it'sone. With property testing is lessdirect than that. It's like I we encodedexpected behavior of the system. Uh andthose behavior failed and now I need tounderstand why exactly they failed. uhbut I'll give you an example ofsomething that that we're chasing at themoment. Uh which is a fairly easy one tounderstand. Uh if the SQLite databaseyou can run an integrity check on thedatabase uh and verify that the thepointers of the database are allpointing to each other right that thedatabase is is not corrupt. Uh if any ofthose thing if the integrity check failsit means that the file is corrupt. Uh sowhat you can do is that you run thefuzzer you do everything and then yourun the integrity check and and you seethat the database is corrupt or notright so this is an example of propertytesting when that when you see that thedatabase is corrupt you don't at thatpoint understand why I mean it's lessdirect than than a unit test you have tonow go and investigate but you knowthere's something wrong uh and why isthe database corrupt because apps failedor or a a the operating system returneda partial right or or because the datawas supposed to be written here and itbecause you had a pointer error andbecause the databases was too big andand you had a off by one error at theend, right? So, but those are exactlythe things that the simulator is doingbecause it's hooked on the IO subsystem,right? Is isfaulty things uh and the combination ofthose many faulty things because this isthe hard part, right? You want to youwant to you want to do you want to testone thing. Sure. things that we testedat Nauseian in the past like how doesthe database behave if there's no spaceon left on the device right you can testthat but what if this happens at thesame time that this other thing happensso the fuzzer is just trying to createall of those weird combinations ofthings and then you run a property checkfor example integrity check on thedatabase and see is this corrupt or notuh and if it is corrupt now you knowexactly every single step that happeneddeterministically one after the otherthat led to that and and and in two daysyou you you have the fix for the issue.So does that mean you you don'tnecessarily codify like expected values?It's more that there's certain set ofstates now that is it sounds like you'realso kind of getting close to the NASA'spower of 10 programming uh which is aset of 10 rules in which they'reclaiming produces highly reliablesoftware. I think uh uh tiger beetle isreally into it with their tiger style orat least some subset of all of that. Uh,do you practice any of this highlyreliable stuff? And if you do, is itactually that painful or is it reallyenabling you to go faster?Well, yeah. So, so I practice a lot ofthat. Not not not as much as Tiger Betobecause Yuron is frankly insane. Uh, youknow, in in in in the most loving waypossible. Uh, and he makes talenteddevelopers look completely hamperedcomparatively. Yeah. So, so you knowjust a I don't think we would go andit's because it's not necessary like uhit's great but it's unnecessary and it'sunnecessary at all stages of thedevelopment as well like but Euron isfrankly insane and again I love him andI said this on on the best way possiblebutum they're they're also and I think itworks for them in in in in a beautifulway but you practice a lot of that. Sofor example, one of the things that thatuh we we don't use in in in ourreimplementation is any async runtime.So you're writing you're writingasynchronous code because one of thethings that we already do verydifferently from SQLite is the SQLitehas a synchronous interfacewhich means like you call SQLite stepwhich is their main API and then thatreturns synchronously. Now, we want tomake it asynchronous because it'seasier. It's and and people conf getconfused with that sometimes. It doesn'tmean we use an async runtime. It meansthat the API that I'm offering you mayreturn I'm not ready. That that's allthat means, right? Because then if ifI'm not ready, what that allows you todo things for example back this databaseonS3 because the data is not local, right?and then you ask me for a page that Idon't have it locally, I return notready and then the async runtime thatyou're using later calls into me. Likeif if you were to implement this S3backend for SQLite SQLite has asynchronous interface, it would blockuntil the pages are here. Like and wedon't have an S3 backend for limbo yet,but you could have an S3 backend. Wehave it working on the browser already.uh and and you do cool things like thatbecause you have an asynchronousinterface but we don't use aasynchronous Rust runtime and the reasonwe don't use one of the reasons we don'tuse a Rust asynchronous runtime is thatthose runtimes we will introduce a lotof non-determinism like they they mayback something by threads uh they theythey may put memory allocations inplaces that you were not expecting andand so so you yes you you one of thedisadvantages is that you kind of haveyou have to go through some level of andand rewrite things, right? More than youuh expected that you more than you wouldotherwise if you if you're just like afree to consume from the ecosystem. Uhwhich you're not when you're doingdeterministic simulation testing. Doesdoes that mean you kind of uh Oh, sorryTJ go. Does the like lack of using aRust runtime directly does that help youguys embed in a bunch of differentplaces too? Like you said you wanted tobe able to run anywhere, right? Like Ithink not all of the rust like I'm notsure Tokyo runs like in WASM and stuffor at least easily. Exactly. Yeah. that.So, uh, one one of the things like withwith flip SQL the fork, we did a lot ofthat, you know, so we didn't go all theway into into this level because it wasa fork. Many different reasons as towhy, but we had a lot of troublerunning. Uh, so one of the things thatpeople kept asking because Dusso, thecompany that that you know that that Irepresent, uh, we have a syncing thingthat syncs SQLite databases to and fromplaces. uh and so we we can use this forexample that you don't have a cache soimagine you have a your SQLite databaseand you write into this database andthen I put a copy of this database inyour server uh so you can keep readingfrom this database at microscond leveluh speed right that that's awesome uhbut the community kept asking us that'samazing but do this on the browserbecause I want to put the database likein the browser uh but but with Tokyo andand and all the runtimes and and andstuff like that it's pretty hard so Sowe never done it. Uh now uh the browseralso has a lot of requirements forthings to be asynchronous like you can'tblock on the browser because you youblock your whole tab. Uh so so it doesit does help us running with with themission of running everywhere, right?But you also have to be very consciousabout dependency like SQLite has a nodependency policy. They do not have anyany any dependencies and part of that isbecause they want the code to be publicdomain. like our code is MIT. We believea proper open source license isimportant for what we're doing for tocreate the sense of community. Uh we donot have a no uh uh uh we don't have anylike no uh dependencies uh policy. Infact, we are a lot more lax in the Cbecause SQLite comes as well with with ashell. We also have our shell and in theshell you're a lot more relaxed. I meanyeah the shell doesn't have to havethose requirements, right? Uh so so soyou can relax this a little bit. Uh butbut but we are very careful with thedependencies that we bring in because weneed to make sure that the they will notdo anything that will make the simulatorlose its determinism. Yeah. So part ofthe reason why you return these like notready yets and all that is it becauseyou are making something that canintegrate with futures really easily orpolling really easily. Is that kind ofthe idea is that you make it hyperembeddible in async but not necessarilyasync itself or because look if if youhave something that can block the theway a asynchronous runtime has to dealwith that is I had to spawn a thread.Yeah. Specifically. Yeah. Yeah. And thenit runs your thing right. Uh so when youdo something that is nativelyasynchronous the the the runtime thefuture's runtime can just call you andthen and then if you're not ready itcalls you again, right? So it's faster.it it's better in many ways. Uh andplaces like the browser may have a lotof problems like calling threads and andspawning threads and doing things likethat. So something that has that isnatively asynchronous uh is is better torun in those challenging environments.If you're running this on your on yourMac or like those things don't matterthat much. Uh it may matter forperformance reasons, but they don'tmatter that much. But when you'rerunning things in into complexenvironments, then they do matter. Allright, we're going to move into the Q&Aportion of the Top Shelf. We source thequestions from the TopShelf channel inmy Discord. And so if you're a part ofthat, you get to ask questions and weanswer them here on the podcast. So ourfirst question today comes from CodeGirl. What role do you Globber see LLMsplaying in the world of databases, ifany? The what what does he mean aboutthe world of databases? Is it writingdatabase code or or I think maybe morelike you can go wherever you want withit. Yeah. Yeah. Because look, a a largepart I know for a fact that a large partof the limbo code is written by Claude.Uh it's it's written by Claude Pekkabecause Pekka uses Claude a lot, right?Uh but but still at at at the end of theday, look, I I'm a I'm a fan of LLMs. Uhand I'm a fan of LLMs in particular incode generation. What I'm not a fan ofis the idea that some people have thatyou can get that code and pull it intoyour project, right? And the the the theway it works better is I have this verycomplicated thing that I need to do.Right? So I'm going to ask the LLM towrite it to me as if somebody else waswriting for example for the Linux kerneland now I'm playing the role of themaintainer and I'm scrutinizing right.So, so, and it's great because you canwrite like tons of code at once thatthat you would take you likemechanically a lot of time to do. Uh,and and andthe other day I was thinking about that.I came up with with with an analogy thatI liked. When I when I was inuniversity, which happened 25 years ago,so you know, maybe things have changeduh from from now to today. Professorswere introducing this amazing technologyPowerPoint. So instead of writing thingson on the check chalkboard, they wouldcome with a PowerPoint presentation andthey would tell you you don't need toworry about copying and they thoughtthat they were doing you a great servicebecause they're saving you the troubleof copying the lesson.What I soon realized is that by notcopying, I was actually not absorbing itthat well because in in in in the act ofcopying and and engaging and and doingthat thing. Yep. It it's manual work,but it's it's work that that has value,right? It's not it's not work withoutvalue. And I think LLMs are verysimilar. If you ask the LLM to generatecode for you and and then you just goand say ah look uh do put it put thecode there and you don't even know whatit's doing. That's the that's the badway of doing it. But if you're askingLLM, help me with this task, uh thenit's a great way to do it. And and thereason this is important is that thereare a lot of things in the databaseworld, they're very boring and I guessin many worlds, but they're they're veryboring to do. Uh they're they're verylaborious and you end up not doing it.uh right or or maybe maybe supporting adriver for a obscure language like oldcamo and something like that like maybethere three four users in the world uhand and you end up not doing it becauseit doesn't matter that much it's just acouple weirdos here and there like inJane Street and and and whatnot uhthat's actually just TJ emailing youfrom multiple accounts they let me havean email from them to trick people intobelieving Jane Street so the four that Icounted is really just you yeah it's mefrom my four emails yeah it's one of Iforget the name. It's the glasses andthe mustache. He's like, \"Oh, yes.Okay.\"So, I at the end of the day, I think solong as you were the one like still incontrol of like what goes through, whichis again a very similar work of what amaintainer in the Linux kernel used todo like there's a rand imagine that whatdo you trust more a LLM or a random dudefrom the internet? And and honestly theLLM in in a lot of ways is better likethe LLM is much better than than I waswhen I sent my first batch to the Linuxkernel that had three bugs in two linesof code. So and and and the maintainerhas to play this role of like readingthis and and saying okay not okay. So soso as long but but you know thosecontributions from random people theygive you this dynamism of like ohthey're doing things that are superboring to do and and I would otherwisenot do. So in a sense it's just you havea bunch of interns and it does allow youto do things you would not otherwise dobecause you wouldn't have the time, youwouldn't have the energy, it wouldn't bea priority. So so I think it will helpget it getting smoother, betterexperiences at the end. But you have tohave people that know how to use it. Uhmeaning like they are still the onessigning on the code, right? Just Yeah.And you also kind of have to have a bitof that visionary mechanic, right? theguy who did that really cool way to beable to fix crashes with Linux and beingable to read out what happened in thekernel and the core dumps. Like, you'rejust not going to get that from an LLM.You have to have somebody that's goingto have to first come up with a lot ofthe ideas and kind of footwork, ageneral conception that you can evendescribe that problem in a way that anLLM can even remotely come up with asolution that would work. And so,there's like a lot of interesting, butthe LM but the LLM helps in there aswell. The LLM helps in there as wellbecause I mean, you know, I just Ihappen to to to know Eric uh fairlywell. I I don't talked to him in a longtime, but uh he had to read a lot of x86processor specs, right? And and and so Ithink the way the LLM helps a lot isthat you have this idea, could I dothis? And then instead of instead ofspending like hours and days and maybeweeks like sifting through like obscuredocuments, hey, uh would that work? Uhand and and then he tells you something,right? And so so yeah, you're still inthe driver's seat. At the end of theday, you have to be in the driver'sseat, but it's not it's it can help youa lot in the ideation part as well. Oh,I'm thinking about implementing thisthis way or or maybe this other way.Would that work or not? Uh and and thenit's very good the because databases andoperating systems are are things aresystems where you deal with obscurestuff all the time. Uh and the LLMs canbe very good at unearthing those thoseobscure stuff and and and helping youdialogue with them. So, it's another wayof uh but yeah, you have to theconception has to start on your head andand then you use it as a as a soundingboard, right? Yeah. I don't know ifyou've tried the like research mode inany of the LLMs lately, but it's prettyinteresting like seeing it go and justbasically like troll through 50different articles and like getsummaries of them and then post links tothose articles and and to those papersand stuff which like is much better thanwhen you just ask it and it makes uparticles and then supports itself fromthem. Like but uh but you know like thatprocess like let's say you're like oh Ispent all my time working on Linuxkernel I just like get thousands ofrelevant articles put them in a spot andI like have it you know let's let's gothrough a real example prime is sayinghere like oh I I like I love the idea ofdeterministic simulation testing I Idon't necessarily quite know how how tomake it happen in practice. This isexactly I think the kind of thing thatLMS can help you a lot with. I want todo it this way. I don't kind of knowwhere to start. Like you're not evenwriting code. You're in the ideationphase, but but you're playing this gamewhere you know where you want to go, butyou know there are potentially five, sixdifferent paths to get there. Uh and youwant you want the the the machine tohelp you understand the concepts, right?And understand like how could you writethis and and so so it it's great. Ithelps you do things that you wouldotherwise not do. Do you see LLMs doinganything inside of the database?I don't even know how we're interested.Yeah.What what I think what what I certainlythink and and and it's one of thereasons that why I think SQLite is goingto be so important or SQLite or thealternatives which one of one of themI'm hoping to provide are going to be soimportant coming you know in the comingyears is that you're going to have a lotmore ephemeral data right just a LLMwriting code and then you and then youwant like 10% of that code to run anexperiment and etc. and you really justwant a database that cost you nothingthat and that's small and then you cantransfer here and there. Uh so I thinkthis will put a level of demand ondatabases that didn't exist before likeas people are writing this code. I meanwhat is the next step? research is isnow but the next step is like you wouldwant the LLM to essentially run test youknow do do all of that that going backto the analogy you wouldn't expect youwouldn't expect the the the randomperson like the 20-year-old Glober incontributing to the Linux kernel to justwrite code you expect him to have runthe code have done basic testing now youyou you're going to find your own thingsthat that that this person didn't findbut there's a level of expectation thatyou must have done all of those thingsand I think Over time, you you're goingto have the same expectation out ofLLMs, right? Mhm. All right. Number two.How did Globber's experience with SilabDB translate to starting Terso and LibSQL and all of that? Any mistakes in thesilo silab project that he learnedfrom? From Mitchie Richie. Wow. So, so Ithink I think one of the thingsthat one of one of the things that itdefinitely helped me to start to wasthat I I knew I could I knew I couldbecause in in in in a lot ofways and like there's this thing goingaround that people always talk aboutlike imposttor syndrome and etc. I don'tknow if that's the proper name or not,but I had a lingering sense of like canI start a company that sounds reallyhard, right? That that sounds almostimpossible. Uh because when you when youjoin something that exists and againbefore that I spent the beginning of mycareer in the in the Linux kernel, RedHat etc. Those are mature things. Mhm.It is very hard to understand how thingscome to be and and it's very hard tounderstand like what are the thechallenges of the early days ofsomething are veryspecular. Mhm. So I think being part ofa early company that neverthelesscreated a very good database uh very youknow highly regarded technically uh butI was there in the earlydays demystified this a little bit forme if if that makes sense in the senselike yeah I mean I I think I can do itand and also because a small company inthe beginning right today is not todayis a big company but uh at the I had todo all sorts of things I mean I had togo help the marketing folks and tellpeople why SILA is great and and and andI made many mistakes in in helping themdo that and led them in in wrongdirections and I had to go help salespeople close deals and and so it it gaveme a lot of experience about like heyhow do you bootstrap something fromscratch u and in terms of mistakes Imean I don't I don't know I think thebest person to ask this question isalways the sila CEO because well he seeswhat I see a mistake as a mistake hemight not see as a mistake and viceversa uh but I certainly I certainly lyfeel thatuh we at SILA should have spent lesstime committed to the direction ofrewriting Cassandrauh and and more time in in in the ideaof there is something in this ecosystemthat needs afacelift because the what became prettyclear tous once and again part of the reason whyI eventually left Sila is that I Idon't think that no sequel is today asrelevant as it was back then. Right.Mhm. And it became very clear inin in the beginning of the process whenwe published Sila. So he spent like ayear and something writing it and andthen you and then you put it out in theworld and I think it became very clearthat the biggest problem in data at thetime was not Cassandra wasKafka and and then like this othercompany came along uh Red Panda uh I'mgreat friends with the founder we andand they use the same to build silly webuilt an engine called sear uh to dolike uh high high performance IO andC++. So we built this engine to do highperformance IO in C++ and then we builtSila on top. What I think it becamequite clear is that the biggest marketwas with Kafka. So I think if people atSila at the time had more of like thisloosely like strong strong beliefsloosely held uh it would have beeneasier to notice oh maybe maybe let'sabandon this that we've been doing thisfor three months and let's go chaseKafka instead because it sounds like amuch bigger market like Red Panda todayis worth north a billion dollars. mayyou know potentially too. Uh soso this is part of and and and in a in avery in a very when we noticed this bythe way people we were very committedalready to like it was very hard to toto dial backand being very specific how that helpedme. This is why now we have a rewrite ofSQLite instead of a fork because we hadthe fork but we were but from thisexperience from Sila that both Beck andI had we had this idea that look we weneed to be ready to tounderstand that maybe we're going in thein in the almost right direction. Silawas in the almost right direction. Uhbut if you had just taken a little bitof a turn and said Kafka is the probleminstead, right? And it's what we endedup doing with with the with first thefork and with the rewrite. Yeah, we'regoing to do a fork. we're going to builda business on it. But we we need to bealways questioning uh okay is is this isthis the right thing? And we need to bequestioning at a moment in which we'renot so committed to this direction thatis impossible to backtrack. So you knowmaybe again maybe the founders of Siladon't see this as a mistake. I certainlydo. Uh and and you know they might havemore context that I don't but that's myopinion. uh and and I try to bring thisto to right just that can we keep thisfor way longer of to say are are we inthe biggest possible market or not andright justyeah that's interesting I think I've gotour last question here um we alreadytalked about limbo but what sort of aninteresting question uh referencing itwas what have you learned about SQLiteand databases that you or or like tersonever thought about uh before startingthe complete rewrite what I learnedabout databases that I didn't realizebefore starting. Yeah. Or or aboutSQLite in particular too if there'ssomething interesting there. Well, youknow, at that point it has to be aboutsquite specifically because I I wrotewith this this my third database whichisbut but you know it's just auh at at SIL I had this experience ofthings about databases that I neverthought before. Mhm. Um, man, I thinkone one thing certainly is is how messySQL is. I mean, SQL is pretty messy. SQLis pretty messy. Uh, I don't fault thepeople who think that they're going tocome up with something better. I thinkthey they're all going to fail. Uh, butbut they're going to fail because of theweight of the ecosystem. Uh, right.There's the weight of the SQL ecosystemis huge, but it's kind of terrible. itit's it's it's kind of terrible. Uh theyou know this the I knew nothing aboutsimulation testing. So there'sdefinitely you know there's definitelysomething there that that I think for mewas very critical. Um I don't think Iwould write a system today that wouldnot use deterministic simulationtesting. So there was that wasdefinitely something in in thattransition. Uh what else? It it's it'sinteresting. I I think a lot of peopledon't realize what what SQLite is andcan be which which is another lessonlike for example uh a lot of the when wetalk about synchronous and aasynchronous one thing we hear a lot isit doesn't matter because the SQLqueries are so fast like they take 300microsconds anyway uh so why bothersynchronous is fineand again this isn't true because a lotof SQLite queries take two minutes uhbecause you're just it's a it if ifyou're doing a CRUD query on on adatabase yes uh select age from userswhere id equals two that yes that takes20 microsconds orwhatever if you're doing a and and SQLis really geared towards this like ifyou're doing a very complicatedrecursive query for your businessintelligence of like find find me allthe users in the last three months whochurn with this criteria of churn whichis by the way queries that we do a loton thuso to to to understand like theuser journey those queries are very veryvery very slow so so sqlite can be veryslow uh for for those very complicatedqueries and I think this is something alot of people don't realize right uh soyeah I mean lessons we keep learninglessons every day but those three arethe ones that come from the top of myhead but to be fair they're they'regenerally slow in every database That'sbut that's my point. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Soyou you can't you can't afford to it'snot that SQLite is bad on those queries.Uh there are exceptions by the waybecause if you go look this is the waythis is the domain by the way where Ithink no SQL is awesome. Uh you havethis query that takes an hour twominutes whatever. And and this query ishigh value enough that you can build adatabase that lays lays out the dataspecifically for that query. uh and andthe best example is time seriesdatabases like so time series if you tryif you try to do time series on any SQLdatabase you're going to suck uh youhave then a a a time series databasebecause it lays down oh what you want isan aggregation so we're going topre-agregate everything we're going towe're going to lay down data in whichthe columns are all close togetherbecause you can just scan them you don'thave to be pointer chasing so so thoseare those are the domains where where Ithink like specialized database areawesome like those queriesbutyet you have your data in the SQLdatabase, right? And and in many cases,you're fine taking 2 minutes. So, youwant to do it in there. Uh and you don'twant to have that done through asynchronous interface. Uh the the thebetter SQLite 3 package for example forJavaScript is a synchronous package andthat's what they argue in in in theirreadme. Uh it's fine because SQLite isfast, right? and and it's not justbecause sometimes it's not fast becauseno other like you're doing a supercomplicated query. I think that'sprobably due to the fact that people'sview of SQLite is very one-dimensional.Oh, you just put very light usersettings in this or you put very smallthings. It's a very ephemeral or lightdatabase though therefore it's alwaysfast, right? But the argument here is noactually we're putting bigger things inhere. Therefore, that argument of lightor quick no longer exists or a differentbackend in the case of like turo. Yeah.Great. Great great point because uh oneone thing one thing I learned with thisexperience of physical is exactly thishow those things are relativebecause uh you know our our first demoof Sila uh so Sila for those you don'tknow is a horizontally scaling databaseessentially can horizontally scaleinfinitely you can just add more nodesand and if you add twice as many nodesas you have now it gets twice as fastthat that's the that's the it's notalways true but that's the selling pointright Um the first demo that we did whenwe launched Sila is like Netflix at thetime had this benchmark where they didlike a median rights per second with a52 nodes of Cassandra. Uh and then wehad Sila doing 1 million rights persecond with one node of Sila. Uh whichwas actually a pretty terrible benchmarkbecause what a lot of people understoodfrom this is that Sila could not scalehorizontally because you should havechosen two nodes. We should have chosentwo right two millions with two nodesbut We never expected that. But I spenteight years working with Sila, right?And and then when we started workingwith with SQLite, uh people would comeand ask me like I I have this very rightheavy workload. Can I use SQLite for it?And and you know, I don't want tomislead anybody. I would just say no.SQLite is not a database that isdesigned for heavy rights. But then Igot into the habit of askingpeople how how many writes are youdoing? and and I would hear answers likeoh you write to the database almostevery seconduh and and I said look that's fine youcan use you can use SQL just fine forthat right just so when you move whichby the way prime this is something thatI appreciate a lot about you this is themoment you know I and I said that inpublic before I want to say it again ohwe're going to have to end the podcastafter this yeah and because I do have togo he doesn't appreciate you TJ just soyou know oh camel man yeah I I alreadyheard him talking about me Okay. I I doI do have to go get my daughter, but butlike the you you have a very rare skillof like understanding that differentthings in different places work veryvery differently. And what we see a lotin the industry is just like, hey, whywould you ever have more than 5gigabytes in your database? Like whoneeds more than that, right? Just andand variance. Uh but look when you movefrom market to market, when you movefrom use case to use case, thedefinitions that people have of what isbig, what is large, what is fast, likethey change completely. Like you talk topeople and say, \"Yeah, we want thosequeries to be very fast. They have to bethey have to be done in less than 100milliseconds.\" Uh and then you go talkto the ad tech folks like the onesserving ads in your browser. Like ifthis query returns in more than amillisecond, they're they're calling youand so you know the database is freakingslow. So and and and then again and youhave a million rights per sec per perper second with with Sila uh and in thein the web domain like I have peopletelling me you know we write to thedatabase almost every second man this isheavy rights you have you you must beable to handle my my amazing rightswhich I'm not discounting it's just toshow and this asking me about what Ilearned like how like you you move alittle bit out to a differentdomain everything changes likeeverything changes whatever you learnedbefore doesn't apply right yeah forthose that don't know if you had a100,000 writes in a day, which is largerthan a lot of companies. A lot ofcompanies do not meet the threshold of100,000 writes per day. That is 69writes per minute. And so nice, right?So it's actually not as high as peoplerealize. That's on average. Obviously,it's going to be much more bursty andall that kind of stuff, but uh peopleoften overindex into what they think ishappening when you're like, \"Okay,you're not really on the millisecondscale or let alone the microcond scale.\"Like you got to realize that your scaleis much smaller. So almost all questionsyou're asking are irrelevant until youget to the billion users. It is veryfunny how uh you know if you're going tomeasure per minute versus per year,it'll sound like a lot or a littlebillion a billion rights per year. Oh mygoodness, they're huge. Well, that's howthat's how you pump the VC money. Butanyways, Glober, thanks a bunch uhpleasure for coming. We had a good timewith you and uh honor getting to chatwith you and we look forward to nexttime we can have you on. I wish youcould see the next Brazilian mojito.There you go. Let's Let's go. Let's go,man. Awesome. I'll see you in Thank you,Prime. Let's go. Yeah. We'll see youguys next episode.",
    "summary": "This YouTube video features a discussion with Globber, CEO of Turso, a cloud-based SQLite platform, and long-time Linux kernel contributor. The conversation revolves around Rust for Linux, drawing on Globber's experience in the Linux community and Prime's observations of the ongoing debates. They discuss the challenges of integrating Rust into the traditionally C-dominated Linux kernel development process, highlighting issues like unclear development expectations, conflicting viewpoints, and the inherent, often harsh, communication style within the Linux community. Globber shares his personal experiences of contributing to Linux, emphasizing its demanding but ultimately beneficial environment. He argues that despite the initial resistance and \"violence\" (verbal), the best ideas eventually prevail in Linux due to its rigorous, organic development process.\n\nThe discussion transitions to Turso's LibSQL project, a complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust. Globber explains the motivations behind this ambitious undertaking, driven by a desire to create an open-contribution alternative to SQLite and to foster a community-driven approach. A key aspect of LibSQL is its use of deterministic simulation testing, a novel method to ensure code quality and reliability by simulating various system scenarios and identifying bugs reproducibly. This approach is inspired by practices from high-reliability software development, avoiding async runtimes to preserve determinism. They highlight the importance of adaptable testing in the database world, as the scope varies wildly between different implementations.\n\nGlobber and Prime also discuss the role of LLMs in database development, emphasizing that LLMs should act as assistants rather than replacements for human developers. He highlights LLMs' usefulness in code generation, particularly for mundane tasks and exploring obscure technical details. Overall, the conversation offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of open-source development, the evolution of programming languages within established ecosystems, and innovative testing methodologies for achieving high software reliability, with a general nod to understanding your project scope relative to what is actually necessary."

that that cannot happen you have tomake sure that you able to make talkingabout appraisals andpromotions I think a lot of people wouldjust get overwhelmed by thispodcast again politics you know doimpact thr it grow but like Tech is veryrewarding the difference between someonestarting and someone quote unquote Proit is just the timespent 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairlycomfortable for most people if theysurvive till uh they offered 9 LPA mycollege after a year when I applied andwanted to join there I got selected6.5 and that thing hurts mebecause all right hi everyone andwelcome to a new podcast today we havearpit arpit how's it going all goinggood yeah thanks for having me thanksfor having me thank you for traveling sofar uh arpit was here to meet the super30 folks for the people who don't knowarpit has had an interesting journeywe'll talk about it uh but recently hewas telling me currently he's trying outa startup if it doesn't work out hisplan is to go back to Google as aprincipal if it doesn't work out hisplan sees to go to any company in Indiabecause all of his students are staffengineers at various companies in Indiathat's the kind of person you're talkingto there's this pyramid analogy that hegave a while back uh this isn't thepyramid this is the pyramid it'sextremely flat by which I mean there alot of people at the bottom but stafflevel principal level L it's really hardto find the right people he was tellingme there's this opening in Google openfor eightmonths so I'm going to call this thepyramid talk understanding how can yougrow up thepyramid sd1 level or you know pressurelevel how do you stay the middle of thepyramid to make sure you don't getfiltered out as you grow up with thatarpit yeah thanks for thank forsummarizing it but one change it's notfallback is not principal engineerengineer but the fallback is Staffengineer at Google but everything elseis true 100% it's definitely much moretapered pyramid it's it's sorry it's notextremely tapered it's very flat at topright so yeah very few good people atthe top perfect soit would love to knowyour journey from the starting when didyou join College I joined in 2008 and uhgraduated in 2012 then did my Ms in 2013to5 okay and what were your colleges myuh graduation College was College ofEngineering Pune and my masters was fromtriple Hyderabad all right very cool ohTri Hyderabad I'm assuming is a goodcollege very good one of the best outsyou in the country yeah so did you feelthat difference between bachelors andMasters so fortunately my graduationCollege was also good uh it ismaharashtra's best collegeuh the kind of exposure I got during mycollege time was invaluable both duringmy graduation and during my masters theone change or another two key thingsthat changed during my masters wasnumber one uh the importance of codingculture which I did not have in mygraduation college and the and thesecond thing was the importance ofresearch culture which again was lackingin my btech college so that exposure wasreally nice uh unfortunately a lot ofpeople who do Masters in India do it forplacement purposes so the crowd had somelike the core motivation of crowd wasdifferent the core motivation ofcrowding my B College was different butpeople who wanted to leverage the waythey would want they have leveraged theMaster's beautiful and the graduationbeautifully but the difference is isthere my B and master col all rightwould you say that was worth it goingfor a masters spending three years uh ifyou do your Masters within 3 years yesafter 3 years no okay because it's notworth it given if like if your soul a isto get a job or let's say go to us orsomething it's better to crack and thendo an internal switch without you losingyour salary or having the 2-year careerbreak you can uh reach to the positionwhere you want to but if you think thator or other your motivation is to godeeper into your subjects deeper intoyour domain and whatnot Master is reallygood uh but you have to be very clearwith your goal because you know therewill be people having placement I havejob job job internship internshipinternship placement placement placementbut then if you look at them and thenyou decide that such you could have donejob and then made an internal switch toa different country or different companyand whatnot right so in my case myintention was to first of all get a goodbrand on my resum I be brutally honestsecond was to uh because what happenedis after mygraduation um I was working for acompany called Sapa softwares my wife mythen girlfriend now wife worked atbasically Delhi MC M Bangalore and Iappliedand uh they offered 9 LPA my collegeafter a year when I applied and wantedto join there I got selected and theoffered 6.5oh and that thing hurts me because itwas not the disparity it was basicallythe parity that happened because of mycollege of graduation I was underassumption mra's best college but no onein Bangalore knew that and that hit mehard I alsobang at that time and they not my resumeand Irealized and that was the thinging hey Ineed a good brand on my resume and Istill need to pursue my passion forengineering which is where uped for gateand joined trip Hyderabad because theyhave their own entrance exam I did like500 rank in Gate uh 300 or 500 somethingI was getting it g at that time I go atthat time but then I chose to appear fortriple it exam cracked it and thenjoined that college and then made themost I could two years right on verycool so you graduated in 2015 so uh bch2012 Masters 2015 all right I wouldassume after 2015 your fresher Journeystarted again I was a associate softwareengineer at D that's how it started yeahall right oh so your first offer wasdeaw yeah and I it in a month and a halfin in a month and a half yeahinteresting yeah I'm too quick tojudge what was what was what did you notlike about Finance no it was not aboutdomain it was about the work that I wasdoing okay like even if I imagine youdoing your Masters and then writing webScrappers not so I was part of frontoffice part of oil Natural Gas andenergy sector so my job my job and mytech lead's job also was to scrapeenergy websites get the latestprices and then inest it in the databasefor Brokers to use right like no notgoing to happen not going to do this forlike 1 2 3 4 5 years of my life Iimmediately made a switch to pra andpror was aggressively hiring I a lot ofpeople from trip wenttoor right right right and then I joineddevop and then life took care of itselfyou said in practce you started todevops yeah oh super interesting so okayI would love to know more about this soyou uh I would assume in college howmuch devops did you do zero zero I didnot even know how server what is aserver how it starts what is a webserver how it connect I have no idea Ijust learned it on the go I go it soprao was a startup back then I was veryfast Peak at the 20152016 got it so how did you learn on thejob how did you make your learning curveso high while you were there so to behonest in for me what the fuel wassimple that although I graduated in 2012I was still a fresher in 2015 soeffectively I did my btech for sevenyearsright right so I had to make up rightfor because I was not making any moneyat that time one year I job one year ofjob I did I put it in my mtech fees so Ihad to cover up because my batches werealready senior software engineers andsome of them were teches so I had toover compensate and because I had toover compensate I'll go all in workedreallyhard made an impact got my firstpromotion in 6months so I was one of the two or threefreshers who got promoted out of batchof 50 50 or 60 freshes they hired andtwo or three got promoted I was one ofthem me a Bazar Raja I remember three ofus definitely who got promoted at thattime andandconfidence although the doain wasentirely new but I still did it and oneof the key highlights that was there washow although I was part of devops I wasalso part of an internal JavaScriptregulation team I had no idea ofJavaScript but my first principlethinking my thought process my attitudeuh I built internal portals and whatnotat that time react was just picking upand I started learning it it's funalthough it's not supposed to be done bya devop but I was still doing it andseeing that I was part of a internalteam for JS Guild where we like one Ffrom each team like we were like seveneight people team who were regulatingJavaScript usage in the organizationthat hey which packages should you usewill do the vulnerability checking thisthat everybody will download packagefrom the same Source not from thestandard npm right and whatnot got it sothe great thing was I never saidthroughout my experience and then Istarted climbing up ladder much fasterbecause of that very cool uh do youremember any experiences of I don't knowgood things that you saw at prao goodchallenges that you got introduced to Uconsidering the scale of the companyback then yeah so at prao um I washandling entire infrastructure so I washandling uh Dev infrastructure and inthe later half of my uh sprinted PR Iwas Al handling a bit of production soone of the key things that I learnedthere was how to manage elastic searchcluster so pract did not use a managedoffering used to run elastic searchcluster on ec2 instances at that time sowhat I had to do was I learned it firstand then applied it that how do you Urehow do you handle Hot Shot problem whatif one of The Shard is becoming piping Hbecause of all the load that is comingin how do you solve it how do youbalance and all those Concepts that Ilearned while managing my own clusterthat helps it still helps me when I amdoing database migration and I'm doinganything else because the underlyingConcepts exactly the same that is onevery cool uh and you worked at pror fortwo years one and a half year one and ahalf year what was your next switch thatwas Amazon Amazon oh interesting okay soFinance to Startuptoig and then I moved to so AmazonHyderabad was there I was part of teamcalled Fast data Technologies so fastdata so we used to take care of coldtearing of hot data so let's say theirmain database is transactional databaselet's say hypothetical example it's MyQit was not my SQL but let's take exampleof my SQL is a hot storage now what weused to do was we used to take data outand move it to a cold tier which is S3okay more important it's not Arch mostpeople think I moving data to S3 it'sarchive it's not archive i have toseamlessly be able to query across thedata right be it hot TI be it cold tierokay we do this to say cost mhm so wewere one of the largest customers of S3like my small team was one of thelargest customers of S3 like we werecompeting directly with Netflix withrespect to the amount of data we save ohwow so that's the scale of Amazon and Ijust learned it while it was there whatit takes to do this and whatnot so weused to run job jobs that used todownload that used to extract the datatransform it a bit create M databasestore it on S3 and more importantly notlosing an ability to query the data youcould see this in example as if you useAmazon app uh you go to orders page andyou see your past orders the most recentsix month orders come from hotstorage when you do it change it andlike that was literally our customerokay so when you change it uh before 6months that all comes from S3 all rightso that is the hot storage and ColdStorage uh that we did at that time verycool how how are you querying from S3directly how would you run so that's thething so that is where you have to storeyour data in a way that you have indexeson your ec2 instances because you stillhave to query it you will not be storingthe data on E2 ins you'll be storingindexes on E2 ins kind of and thenuh when you make a request it comes to acentral router that router checks thehot storage if it has the data it Servit if not it comes to Cold Storage ColdStorage is one of the servers thatserver has the data great it serves itif not goes through SD gets the datacaches it for some time and then servesit so but that when you're doing this onS3 it's not you can think of it as nineimplementation is one file for eachorder M but then you would have so manyfiles correct which is justimpractical so which is where you haveto create a bunch of embedded databaseswhere you store this key value store ina efficient format and that small indexis loaded here so that you still knowwhere to go and read the data and thenserve it so without losing an ability toquery the data on S3 so we have we didpointed reads of a fraction of datawithin a file on S3 all right so yousave a ton of money that scale of AmazonSuper same all right oh that's Prettcool so saying most data that's archivalin Amazon things like past orders someof it comes from hot storage a lot of itis S3 I would assume most of it a lotmajority of them is because you're verylikely to query your most recent orderyeah and not so likely to query yourolder order so all of that comes from usvery cool uh so this was your work atAmazon any other interesting project youworked on Amazon was this all right thenyou switch to there go for five yearsfor five years five years yeah okay Iwas pretty to join there uh 2018 FB iswhen I joined and left in2022 2018 FB so what were your whatnumber employee were you on in the techteam my employee ID was 1 123 oh wow itwent like a it like a dummy ID when Iused to say this everybody usedTock right so my employ C was 123 I wasmostly 12th 12th or 13th person in Techoh wow very early so I started I startedhandling search okay there buil entiresearch ground up uh then looked at thenwhile I was mentoring back end folkshere and there doing Cod reviews I was asenior most person in the at that timeoh so a lot of stuff uh had to behandled and all quite fun time um then Ijoined as a technical architect there uhslightly loaded titleButch architect I got and I wasmentoring backend people I was handlingsearch search a bit ofgamification anduh mentorship optimization databoptimization and all but a lot of myenergy was on search then I builtnotification center Ina notificationcenter uh Pura and then I transitioninto leadership role okay into eingmanagement then I built search sorrythen I built s team ground up again mydev's experience at pror helped me and Ibuil entire team count up and then Itook also took care of data engineeringteam five years passed gradu move toGoogle nice good times unacademy was mybest experience so far okay undoubtedlywhen it comes to people learning jobwhat what was the best part aboutunacademy working there to be honest itsound cringy but yeah everything becauseuh it never felt like it was someoneelse's company I never felt like anemployee never alwaystook but deep inside I knew how much Icared for the product how much I car forthe company to win so I still rememberevery Friday s used to go down me and myfriend becauseas we used to work andcome and make it uh make it up and rningagain while Techwe used to have game nights every Fridayand every Friday while that game nightwas happening the search used to go downbecause of the peak traffic that we usedto get right and then we sat once andforall so yeah people were amazing uh Techwas very nice I learned a lot of hacksthere that um and since then I've beensaying this um what matters is businessproduct and then engineering engineeringis always an unbl right nobody caresabout a solid principle liquid principlegas principle if your business is notsurviving cor or if your business is notdriving you don't have a goodproduct so I understood the importanceof that and more importantly how companytransitions no from a very small companya little startup and then when venturecapital is infused and a huge venturecapital is infused what it takes for youto operate at massivescale well by the time we could react wewere already a billiondollar and then so many[Music]people so much of stuff that werehappening that it was becoming difficultmore difficult by the day to manage itbut then that was my learningthing let's build deep ground up nowalready has an experience come an em andbuild a team right and so on so for soit was very nice combination uh butagain the curse of becomingbigger prior like things we used tosay now becomes officialGade and that is something that we didnot like it much like all the oldfolks we like better off we would do itright so a lot of those things scpt upbut that was a good learning that youunderstand how a company Transitions andyou have to adapt to it you cannot justsay it anything will still be chaoticright at that skill you have to havethose processes if you don't haveprocesses you know what all things cango wrong so that was very good uhlearning not just from coding codingside but also from what it takes tobuild a team scal team importance ofprocesses um setting up right processessecurity practices zero trust onemployees so that was very nice verycool uh yeah I lot to talk about yourjourney there considering I'm assumingwhen you joined the devop pipeline wasveryjanky and by the time you left I wouldassume since it was acompany you know everything was stableas you said employee management thingslike these Journey first I'm assumingyou L it an academ is also one productthis is when you open any Tex page yeahwhen it comes to the front end when itcomes to their you know if you've seentheir live video you've probably seen itnever seen a better one everyone elseuses Zoom unacademy has its own livetrue so would love toknow I don't know about the product wasgreat one of the best products thesecret source of an academy was thepassion ofpeople the people who are building itnever again I I again repeat he we allnever felt it was someone else's companywe all were very proud of what we werebuilding so first years was like thebest for us we neverthought we built video calling foreducator payments part unacademysubscription was when we were there likeentire business model changing we sawimpact of business model nobody had donesubscriptions in N Tech anad was thefirst one to subscriptions in Tech rightso that was fa and because we were soengrossed with the vision and we feltourvision plus we had some very amazingdesigners and all they the found thengavethen the business sorry then the productdesign guidelines were so in placethat everybody stuckto what was part of the uh guidelinesand all and it was very well taught sohim kov both are extremely focused on onCrafting great user experience and thatis shown through and through produdevelopment life cycle engineering wasour passionbusing then wealso we Cann make cor it very cool uh doyou can you talk about theinfrastructure at unacademy finally bythe time you left or is that INDinfrastructure is it what inra size ofinfra where did you guys deployed whatcloud what technology it was all AWS allAWS we already have blocks I'm notspilling the VIN here it's all out therewe were on AWS uh completely on AWS wehad uh almost no plans of moving outbecause of the tight coupling of ourservices deployment Frameworks and whatnot with AWS and and that was primarilyour infra um multi- region yes uhSingapore was our primary monolithicregion and live classes were driven fromMumbai okay because when an academystarted Mumbai data center wasn't thereright so that's why all the services allthe backend Services were in uhSingapore got it while live classesbecause of minimizing latency were allin Mumbai these were like key differentkey difference uh sizing and all wasabove average than most companies inIndia U we are playing a pretty heftyamount to AWS as our monthly bill whichwas pretty interesting I neverthought but that was that was a biglearning and more importantly that whenyou have this big of an infra it's oneof my biggest St was it's not the matterof what goes wrong it's matter of whereit goes[Music]wrong yeah if you assume let's say onein one year goes down onetime onaverage so when you have a massive infrait's not the matter of what it's matterof when when it will go down and youhave to be prepared for things goingwrong things shutting down abruptly umone of the most interesting challengeswe used to get and we used to shout atAWS for this is their EVS volume sothere so we use RDS to host the databaseand then EBS volume used to keepflipping rightand it used to keep crashing and then itit used to lead toour realiz that because of the size ofinfrastructure it's bound to happen andyou have to be ready with that rightlike what do you do to make sure thatyou are not impacted much right sointerest all right so not F facechallenges AWS is not able to handle ourload yet or our bandwidth yet it wasactually not AWS is not able to handleit's likeit could be because AWS is pretty vastand our traffic is not as much as like Iwas giving an example of what we did atwhat I did at Amazon the thing is thatyou cannot consider your infrastructureto be always up and running correct whenyour infra size is large things goingdown is much more C you cannot think ofit as an exceptional event it's notexception it's a normal you have to beokay with that so that was our biggestlearning thing being prepared for thingsgoingwrong having a fall back having a rightthat we had to ensure across all of ourservices also that was prettyinteresting and challenging very coolcool U 5 years at an academy thenGoogle back to Big Tech back to Big yeahbig Tech started big Tech yeah so yeah Ijoined Google I was uh India for dataPro Data proess managedEOS system man SP what actuallyunfortunately fortunately people haveAWS inso gcp equalent of that is data right soI was part ofperformance uh gcp data performance sowe used to take care of uh making surethat Apaches Park that we run runs thebest on gcp so we used to manipulateApaches those Vari of apach spark addour patches to it and make it hyperoptimized to run on gcp workloads allright so this way our customers get bestservice we don't use things out of thebox from open source right we optimizeit for uh our Hardware ourinfrastructure and then pass on thebenefits to the customers so I was INDfor data all right had you worked onsimilar problems before never so I Ihave to learn on the even at I was doingsearch I never worked on search atpractor I worked on devops I never workI never started a server right then atAmazon I was doing colding of big data Inever worked on that uh an academysearch never worked on notificationnever worked on feed but again for me itwas plus I never managed a team I neverbuilt a team from ground up uh never didinra rotation so there are a lot ofthings that were new almost always buthaving that right tolearn what's so tough in it nothingtough like you just have to put in thedifference between someone starting andsomeone quote unquote Pro in it it'sjust the time spent in that doain that'sthe only difference I agree if I spendenough time same time as that person Iwould be able to know the same thingsthe same set of things maybe even betterright maybe even more than what thatperson knows so with that it was easierfor me to like that was the mindset thatI I've always operatedon right makes sense that that leads totwo questions U one is how was yourinterview process at these companiesconsidering yeah that's the firstquestion so one thing I realizeis it's all about how you communicateduring intervie how how strong is yourconvictionH now most people they fear or they'reintimidated by oh my God this issomething new I will not be able to doit but if you showcase a high convictionin my case because of my personalitybecause of my slightly Ecentricpersonality I'm able to radiateconfidence better I'm able to speakbetter so it's about if I have highconviction that I'll figure it out Mthen the hiring manager also has a highconviction all okay and the interprocess is almost always like they judgeyou on your problem solving skills andthis and that if you're able toarticulate your thoughts well you'reable to solve the problems that havebeen asked in the interview you'll 100%be able to uh crack theinter definitely Stu is going there andmaking an impact that takes time so youcannot Bluff you cannotlike that that cannot happen you have tomake sure that you are able to make animpact after you join right so youcannot lie over here so your convictionneeds to be high but backed by your pastachievements right it cannot be likeany not to up then you lose your jobright so this is something that I alwaystell people that you should radiateconfidence you should have Highconviction in your abilities but itshould be backed by your past data rightbeen there donethat for and whatnot with Awardsrecognitions impact output outcomesome and uh interview process mostlythis and they see how Keen you are intosolving this problem most people are notkeen tackling the new new challenge mostI I worked on search I'll solve search Iworked on this I done this now imaginehow many people in India or even in theworld would be there who are working onopen source Apaches part and optimizingits performance you cannot expect thiskind of work to be like you cannotexpect to find people who have donesimilar work right right right rightpossible prodop you can still findpeople with similar experience for thisobscure type thing it's incrediblydifficult which is where your firstprinciple thinking right your at tosolve problems and all of that K in sointerview difference is more about youshowing your faith and themreciprocating in the right s and againit's their responsibility to evaluatebetter right if they have made a badcall hiring me for example they wouldchange theirinteressright either I either I or they learnyeah the second question here is willvery relevant for people people get veryover with the newtechnology so you know I think if I askmost people here they'll belike they're going to judge me onimpact so how do you think you did thathow do you think that is the thoughtprocess of people I think people don'tgenerally like computer science most ofthem said everybody has an inclinationright but why do you think people havethatattitude I think it's more like theyconfident in cracking interviews becauseit's cracking an interview is sort ofrigged right at some point it's it'slike preparing examination yeah youalways Tau to prepare well forexamination and that's end of storyexactly you nevertold that's a situation so most peopleone I realiz iswe are all taught to study a fixedsyllabus M crack an exam join a collegeor join a job what people feel incollege exact same thing they feel atjob okay how do I differentiate yeah howdo I crack marks how do I do thiscollege m still is there also you havelike different examinations to crackmarks soob people try to manipulate orthey try to have this as de[Music]theydraw right right right so everything sowhich iswhy bu for the problem it's in two partsfirst is startups and second is Big Techright now big Tech process is very uhstrategized it's very form you exactlyknow okay these five things I'm supposedto do and this is the rating I would getright so that's why good students alwaysdo well atBig because they exactly know what theyChing you have to have you have to beowner of at least one service you haveto drive business impact of at least oneif it's not written then manager wouldtell them because manager people arebecause manager is also chasing somegoals correct correct so good studentsdo very well at Big Texs you there is astructure right there is a checklistthat you are following exactly verysimilar to your checklist during yourcollege days and during your exampreparationphas but things become very interestingwhen it's a startup when it's ambiguouswhen managerknow and priorties keep shifting andthis and that this is where people willfind the hardest and to be honest morepeople work in these type of companiesthan big Tech correct correct so whichis why most people find it hard so onething I always tell key it does notmatter the the lines of quote that youhave shipped what isstable is it driving the impact it issupposed to because I've known I'veknown a person who has built threekiller features but none of themworked guess if that person would havegotten a promotion ornot I would assume nono again was that person's faultno but it was a collective failure offorexamp you're there you win your teamwins you cannot say because your theoutcome see output is in your controloutcome is not in your exactly outcomeis a collective effort it's Collectiveeffort of entire Team Managementleadership business marketing everythingright so whatever is in your control youdo your best and thenbecause in my case also there have beentwo products that have been completelyscraped after I work on it for 8 monthsdid I whine about it I feel bad but thenI had to make sure that I am havingenough other impactful stuff right andpeople need to understand and peoplefind it difficult because theyare amb envirment they don't find itright so having an ability to spot hethis is impactful or this is the bareminimum efforts I would drive the maximpact and I could go above and beyondhere is important I'll give a simpleexample like Extreme Concrete example isum let's say I know my project is goingnowhere now what should what should I doI know that this project is doomed tofail and I know I would not be getting apromotion what should youdo one okay here are ideas you talk toyour manager manager probably manag youare being so pyou are seeing it your manager is notseeing it exactly so that that part isclosed second is I would just makesure have some other impact that I canshow but then manag would say your yourentire should be hereyeah third option is you try to improveyour visibility in the same time rightcompany TI talk though ah okay helpother people Mentor few folks make helpotherswill you are collecting your brownypoints this is at one point this isliterally what I did really okay I wouldassum at Pig Tech not start upstart so because if you see thatsomething might not work you have tostart working on your plan B much soonerright right without telling other peoplethat this is my plan right and withoutyou showcasing your disinterest or yourpism because if you show your pessimismpeople working with you will becomenegativeyeah you should be very this that andwhat without putting yourself in badbooks you have to still drive inback because obious Seasons because thisproject is important for organization soyou start working on Parallel thingsright at least because then you that youcould not have done if you were busy ifthis was impactful very high focus youcould not have done that right so usethat time to drive other things andthat's how you still make sure thatthroughout your Span in yourorganization wherever you are workingyou have something impactful every monthcoming out right it may be your directwork it may be your indirect workthrough mentorship and all it could beyour visibility thing it could be yourinfluence it could be your new processthat you have introducedso you have to make sure that you aremaking you're delivering enough impactright in oneyear talking about appraisals andpromotions so I think a lot of peoplewould just get overwhelmed by thispodcast again politics you know doimpact show it grow um but like Tech isvery rewarding umeven if you're working you know in Indiaonly us it's very reporting even inIndia so what do you think if someone isyou know growing up the pyramidcorrectly paying their debts doingeverything right and growing up to thepyramid how much money can they retirewith in India uh you know humbly ifthey're working not taking any randombets they weren't early at zato and thatIPO they w at a Google and Amazon um youknow paid their debts so typicallysalaries based salaries would capsoftware around 1C even for a descent ifyou take that as ceiling 1C is a ceilingthat someone would hit uh to one CR for5years would be almost negligibleexpenses and all so roughly five to sixlike would end up making a milliondollars right 7 to8 CR on a aboveaverage basis rightright so if you're investing right andif you're you know just doing a job andI would assume there are stocks on topyeah so if you add that up um by thetime you retire you're probably prettycomfortable yeah most people would beextremely comfortable you just need onebig Tech experience or a well-knownstartup experience in your resume withinfirst 7 to 8 years okay then it's asmooth sailing after that gothen even if you do average or aboveaverage at least you'll getinterview you keep making you'll keepconsistently making that bare minimumamount right and so 5 to 6 to 7 CR isfairly comfortable for most people ifthey survive till4045 in Tech gotand last question let's talk about whatyou're doing right now so you leftGoogle 6 months ago I left in Januaryit's almost 11 months now 10 months nowJanuary 6th I left Google oh God so theclock is scking you told me in a yearyou can join Google back in a year yeahwithout an interview yeah clock isscking um what I'm up to is uh I I leftGoogle to start a different company withKrishna I built uh I I started with dwhich was supposed to be LinkedIn forpeople in Tech I realized AI is comingpeople are copy pasting from chat GPTthis is not going to work so then wepivoted into profile building and thenwe pivoted into interviews I don'trelate much with interviews so that'swhy I Ste down I'm still playing atechnical adviser role for them MH andthen I had a side project dice DB itstarted as a redis replacement uh twoand a half years back and now I'vereignited that project again reuvenhe I got a unique Insight after studyingpapers 6 months straight every singleweekend going through so many databasesSource Code Red dragonfly Juno pogress abit ofit and then got that one unique Insighthe this is one unique Insight that noother database in the world hasliterally no other database and this isone audacious problem that I want tosolve right so right now now as of todayI don't know what lies in the future butas of today I on a mission to solve oneof the hardest problem in computerscience sounds fancy I'm I'm a salesperson now so there are two hard thingsin computer science naming things andcash inv validation we want to makesecond one OB okay so that's the MissionVision we are chasing MH and uh we willbe a super cach um our hypothesis istoday every single microservice has itsown transactional DV and has its owncach correct we don'twant like each micros service having atrans DP makes sense because that's asource of Truth correct but what wehypothesize is that cash should becommon across allservices the reason is that if I want toif one service wants to access cash dataof another service they should be ableto directly access it rather than themstitching another data pipeline toreplicate the more most recent changeshere corre it should happen directlyright so that's a fundamental shift inarchitecture we bringing from a mtopology to a star topology whereeverybody talks to this and this will behorizontally scalable sharded bed allthe buzz words that you can think ofright it's right here all right and yeahthat's what I'mon it's a fun problem to very cool umone last question I will ask so thisspecific project now you you're buildingalmost database or a cache as youmentioned uh how did you gain enoughknowledge and insights to be able to dothat and now your answer is going to beread through code bases but how doessomething else okay tell me the answeris not through Cod the answer islearning on the go okay so again mostpeople operate like that perfectionistin reality they are not right rightright theywant I'll read Sudan I'll read this fivebooks and this 15 books and this blogand this thing and then I'll startbuilding it you're almost never readyright you are never ready to get marriedyou are never ready to become a dad youare never ready to do anything in lifeit's just about saying yes and thenfiguring out things on the go and it's avery cliche thing but and now I'm anentrepreneur and I feel it it'sliterally like jumping off the airplaneand then you're stitching your parachuteon while you are jumping right rightwhile you are falling down and you arebeing scaredevery two months we change our visionof figure out something so you have tohave that Knack of solving problem andlike for example I never implementedright ahead l in my life but I had to doit so I went through open figure outwhat it does how it does wrote the codeunderstood performance Chang it and thenimplemented so you being able to figureout the figure out t[Music]and this is true for almost all fieldsand all all domains and common allentrepreneurs but especially forengineering folks this is must this isnot just for entrepreneurship but evenfor you know when you are working havingan ability to Knack interestingchallenges or interesting Solutions orhacks andall are in a more situationmy beenlearning what thewor will be it will be not perform rightfor then it's it later just make surethat the code is extensible your code isplugable let say the voluminterpretation I was talking about Iwrote an abstract wall that does ballacross sqlite also and across up andfilealso supp up and only file is notperform and I figure out another I justhave to implement those three methodscorrect and then so being aware thatwhat you are writing might not be mostperformant and being and making yourcode flexible enough to accommodate futmaybe let'ssay let's say20x okay and I might not be able to takeit to 50x ever right but if this productdoes well and I hire a person whose jobis to optimize it can take it to 100correctright needproduction everything Cod isnot right that's the best part of ourright you can always Circle back andchange the things and all so that's theattitude and that's the difference iswhat I felt a lot of peopleare they they are selfconstrained it's not you start writingcode you realize how easy it is correctexactly if you don't write code youalways think it's very difficult yep I Iagree 100% I thinkthe practicallystart well guys lastly is great atgiving challengesyou have a challenge for the audiencesome random question that you knowthere's a quirky answerto I have a very interesting questionlet's see again folks who are watchingthis it's a very it's a very qu questionthe questionisum you have to write off you have to youdon't have to write a function you haveto write the signature of a sortingfunctionokay the function Declaration of asorting function function you can passarray also link list also okay but youdon't know if it's are or link list okayokay so in the function body you cannothave an if if AR do this if link list dothis you cannot do that okay you have towrite the signature of the function suchthat you pass it an AR it will sort ityou pass it in link you pass in a linklist it will sI just want signature of the function Idon't even want the function thefunctionimplementation some level of overridinguh things like equal to imagine no it'sClanguage norokay list is a specific data structurewe havecreated and in any way you would passboth of them as pointersactually you acting a void start correctcorrect it could be an err pointer itcould be this what would be yourfunction signature and if possible as anextension what would your implementationthen without and your Cod should nothave if this do this if this do thisrightsodayday I have I have an idea but stopyou have anything else for the audienceanything you want to share last partingthoughts parting thoughts be curiousyeah have right attitude most people uhstop beingcurious nobody should stop beingcurious I very childlike uh a lot ofpeople don't take me seriously becauseof that and it's totally fine so long asI'm not losing the smile on my face I'mhappy I'm making money and that's whatmatters but one thing that has helped mereach where I have reached is because ofmycuriosity and high bias for Action rightbecausecurios but if you're not actingon so a lot of people have startedlosing their cuity and I'm seeing thathappening so just want to reinstate thatfact cu the do is beautiful fall in lovewith her do and just dig deeper it's thebest thing amazing with that I hope tosee some of you at the top of thepyramid I'll see you guys in the nextone bye-bye thanksthank that's why you need compar that'ssyst so if it's you don't need a comparyou knowthat but you need to know how to accessdata now followquestion the function that you'repassing in is how you e the rightand you know Cas of list the element Ineed need to be element right below itbeforeit the thing is you don't care aboutcomplex here the key thing wasabstraction like how we thinking ofabstraction like finding the thingswhich are different and then abstractingthem out to either passing off afunction or passing an argument orsomething Havefunction soit's add could beanything basically so threefunctions abstractor slapping indexand 15 20 minutes able toand he knew that I was going to figureit out so they asmeI this question Stay With Me Something Iwas always like you never anticipatequestions[Applause][Music]",

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9gUFy-9uCM",

    "transcript": "so TCP is the most reliable way for twomachines to talk to each other over thenetwork the real question is how is oneweb server able to handle and servemultiple TCP Connections in this videoLet's understand this by building ourown server from scratch using rawsockets and while doing so we willunderstand system calls socketprogramming their limitations and thenwe tune our approaches to handlemultiple requests at once so let's jumpright into it so we all know TCP mostreliable way for machines to communicateto each other and The Logical entitythat wraps the entire thing aroundcommunication is called as a socket wetypically see connections to be of twotypes TCP connections and UDPConnections in this one will focus moreon TCP but UDP is very similar to itit's more about the guarantees that eachone of them brings in TCP more on thereliabilityUDP is more about basically fire andfolder you can read more about it onGoogle so let's start with the mostfundamental question what exactlyactually is a TCP server so to put it ina simple terms TCP server is a verysimple process that runs in a machinethat listens to a port which understandsTCP right so for example I can start anApache Tomcat server I can start aspring boot server I can start a flaskdevelopment server I can start anyserver which listens to a particularPort anyone who wants to talk to thismachine has to communicate over thisport that's the semantic right okay soif we want to write a TCP server fromscratch what exactly would we need wewould have to start a process which istypically what we do go run somethingand then we have to listen to aparticular Port so let's start with thisright so here I'm starting from anabsolute scratch I have no code writtenI'll start with creating a simple filemain.go the entire demonstration will bego base but you can pick your favoritelanguage to implement right so we'llstart with the simple thing so we'llstart withpackage Main and then Funk Mainwithin which I'll write fmt Dot printlnand I'll write hello Whitethis is a very this is a very simplehello world program in golang so I'll dogorun main.govand we can see Hello World gettingprinted on the console and it did rightso our goal is very much set up so whatdo you want to do when our processstarts basically what we are writing iswe're writing our own TCP server so whenthis TCP server starts we want to listento a particular Port so in golang thereis a package that does that called netso when I can do what I can do is I cando net Dot listen and I can pass in thathey I want to listenfor the TCP protocolon the port 1729 which is what I'll doright so when I write net Dot listen TCPand then the second argument I passwhich Port I would want to listen to itmeans that I am like this process is nowreserving a port1729 right so now I canjust run ghost run main.co and let's seewhat happens nothing actuallyprogram started and program finished byprinting hello world so did it even doanything it did it actually when theprocess started it actually reservedthis port for this process but becausewe did not do anything after that itjust released it just it just killedright because it just successfullyreturned right okay so now what do wewant to do let's see the return value oflisten so listen returns an error and alistener right so what we'll do I'lljust accept this I'll say l i s t e n er and error and in case there is anyerror we'll just do a fader right now iferror not equal to nilwhat I'll do is I'll do log dot fataland I'll kill myself and that is fineright because anyway it's a simple thingthat we're doing and I'll just do copyof listener and I'll just printlistener over herethat if I do again nothing would happenbut I just got printed hello world it iswhat is expected over here okay so nowlistening is done but now what afterlisten what's the second step this isthe first step so we havestarted reserving a port for us nowwhat's the second step the Second Stephere is that we wanta client to connectthat's really important right so whathappens is there is a system called callaccept the accept system call is ablocking system call so when you callaccept your program would block at thatstage and it would only move forwardwhen some client connects to it so whatI can do is the listener that we createdthat hey on this port whenever someclient connects then do something rightso this is a blocking call remember thisso now what we'll do is we'll write thissame part over here andjust close this off okay so here what weare doing is we want we have thelistener set up now we are waiting forthe connection to happen so I'll dolistener dot accept this is a blockingcall now what's the return value ofaccept returns me a connection and anerror so I'll accept it in theconnection objectand an error object I'll copy paste theerror in case any error kill myselfbut then whatever I got is theconnection I'm just printing theconnection at the end because it's theconnection that I got right now let'srun thisnow let's run this and see what happensso I have a separate terminal set up forthis exact same thing I'll do go runmain.go and my server has now startednow that my server has started what Ihave to do is I have to connect to itnow because it's a TCP server I canliterally fire a simple code request wehave not handled HTTP yet but what I cando is I can fire a simple curl requestbecause a simple code request intosetting up an HTTP connection internalit is also TCP connection so curl HTTPcolon slash localhost colon1729 willactually establish a TCP connection withthis server and then I should see itmoving forward so you saw that here Ihave Goran main.gov it did not killbecause it is waiting it is waiting forthat connection to be accepted right aclient to connect now let's see whathappens when some client connects soI'll just hit call on this and we sawthat it printed in the print I passedconnection it printed something and thenit exited which clearly sees or whichclearly shows that our server is runningit is bind it is reserving the port 1729it is listening on it it is waiting forany client to connect on it whenever aclient connects at that point in timewhat we are doing is we are printingthat and exiting right so we just builta very simple TCP server that listens toa particular Port it waits for a clientto connect to it once the clientconnects they are printing thatconnection and we are exiting right sothis is a very simple TCP server that wewrote now what's the third step thethird step over here is that once theconnection is established in the coderequest what we get we'd get HTTPrequest so what we have to do is when aclient connects to my server I wouldhave to read the request I would have todo some processing and then I would haveto write the response and then close theconnection so that's exactly what we'lldo soagain let's jump to our code and we'llstart making the simple changes sowhenever I'm getting a particularconnection let me write a simplefunction called do and I'll pass theconnection object over here and in thedo functionI will be passing net dot connectionnet dot connection I'll accept myconnection object and what it would dois add one connection to read somethingI want connection to write which is I'llwrite the response I'll accept therequest I'll write the response and thenI'llclose the connection right okay nowlet's see each of the methods parameterso what is read accepting readexaccepting a byte diary so obviously youwant like when you are doing read youwant to read the request and store itsomewhere which is what we are doing soI'll create a byte object simple I'llcreate a buffer of byte and I can passin a bit I'll have to do this buffer ofY is equal to make now passing of bytelet's say one zero two four the maximumrequest or the maximum length of therequest that someone can send me islet's say one zero two four charactersor other one zero two four bytes rightso what I'll do is I'll pass buffer overhere right so this is where what I'mmaking is I am now listening so when theconnection is established I am makingthis read call now what is this readcall this read call is also system callwhich means it is a blocking call sowhen this function is invokedmy process would not move forward overhere it willstop like untiluntil client sends me the request soonce the connection is established I'mmaking a read call so I am I'm waitinguntil my client sends me the requestonce the client sent me the requestlet's see what it gives me it gives me nand error n is basically the number ofbytes that I read and error so I haveskipped the number of bytes that I readbut if I see any error like always I'lljust do log dot fatal of n this is justmore about because it is demonstrationI'm just basically killing my processevery time I'm seeing anything wrongright okay but in production you mightdo something different so now that wehave read now what do you want to do wegot the request and then we have to dosome processing let's say we do someprocessing andfor us the processing is more aboutsleeping time dot sleep one into timedot second so what I'm doing is I'mmimicking a long running process todayit takes me one second to do somethingright so I'll wait for one second andthen I'll write what do I have to writewhat I have to write is the rightaccepts a bytes likes to be written nowwhat is this byte slice now I canrespond with anythingliterally anything I can pass in of byteand say I want to pass in hello worldeasy Quest we would want to send in HTTPresponse so that your girl understandsthat it got HTTP response I can sendthis as well but what we'll do is we'lljust format it in a beautiful wayso thatyour curl actually renders hello worldbeautifully so I'll just send HTTP 1.1space 200 okay which is 200 ResponseCode slash r slash n and then I'll doslash r slash nhere this is the protocol that we arefollowing and yeah we are writing thisand then we are closing the connectionso if all goes well where we should beseeing is when we start the serverand we fire the request we should seeHello World in the response let's see ifwe see Hello World in the response ornot be fired we got the request boomhello world and if you see it took sometime to do it because we added thatsleep of one second otherwise it wouldhave responded immediately so what wejust did is we send the HTTP request ourserver sent the response so now you canvery easysee that the changes that we did overhere is we you can see that whateverrequest we are getting we are capturingit in buffer you could you could extractthe HTTP URL and then you can write yourown fancy stuff that hey this is themethod this is what I would want to callwhich is exactly how your what your webbrowser does like your spring Boot andyour flasks and all they do exactly thisso whatever you get on the socket theyextract that information and see whatmethod needs to be invokedokay but will not go into writing thatbut you see how we read we processed andwe responded and then we close theconnection right okay so what's the nextstep we did all of this but few thingsto note thatthe read call is a blocking call theright call is a blocking call so whenyou invoke the read unless there issomething from the client to send to youyou would not be moving forward so it'svery essential that you exactly you knowwhen to call the read function you wantto be exactly sure when you're callingthe right function because if a clientis not able if your client is notreading why you are writing then yourprocess is blocked right so you have tobe very very very very very careful okaynow let's see what happens now the nextstep is we want to do this over and overagain now if you look carefully what hasjust happened is when I ex when I wasexecuting this I started my HTTP serveror rather I started my web server let'ssee it once again and then when I firedthe curl request what happened is I gotthe response and my server exited itexited successfully there was no erroryou could not see any error over hereyour server actually perfectly exitedbut is that what our web server does noour web server is continuously runningcontinuously accepting the request doingthe processing writing the response sowhat we'll do is it will change our codewe'll change our code to do exactly thisso what we have to do is we have to putthis in andinfinite for Loop simpleI just put everything in an infiniteformulaso now what would happen when I fire arequest the request would go like a partof the curve requested to come to theserver server do that processing andthen it would wait it would again comeback to listener dot Excel when it comesto listener.accept it would start Prosit would wait for a client to connectand then do the processing all overagain right so let's see a quick demoand see how it pans out so I'll do gorun main.go on the second I'll pass curlHTTP colon slash localhost 1729 we gotthe response but now you see our serveris still running without any problem Ican fire another request in one secondI'll get another response I fire anotherrequest I get another response thereason it is happening is because we putaccept inside the for Loop so what ishappening the control flow of our codeis looking something like this the codeentered over here it is waiting for aclient to connect once the clientconnected it do do Connection in whichwe side we processed and we output itright which is exactly what we did andonce we responded the connection wasclosed it again came back in the forLoop and we did this it again waited andthen again and again all over again soif I would have exited this for Loop myprogram would have exceeded becausethere is nothing more to execute whichis why typically web servers aretypically implemented as infinitelyrunning for Loops right now you see howweb servers are implemented now the nextstep we are doing this all over againbut then what's the challengelet's run let's hit multiple requests atthe same time and then let's see whathappens so before we do that let mefalsefully just add this response tolet's say eight secondsso what I'll do is the processing thatI'm doing let that processing happen for8 seconds so that we can see the demo oflike how things react so what I'll do isI'll start my server againgo run main.go in the first client thatI have top right I'll invoke the curlrequest I'll just quickly invoke thecall requestI got the end I find another colorrequest now if you look carefullythe server is doing something we don'tknow what we are doing we haven't addedlock statement but my client one gothello worldbut now it has been very long my clientwho has not got any hello now it gothello world hey what's happeningI thought we would get response atnearly the same time because we calledcurl from both the places in one shotbut it did not happen let's add somelogging statements to understand what ishappening so whenever I am acceptingso let me write this uh fmt or other logdot printlnwaiting for a client to connectand then when the client is connectedI'll writetill I'm connectedand on right so we're waiting for theclient we say client connected and we doprocessing it does the processing anddoes not so I'll just add one more lockstatement over here I'll writeprocessing the request it would give usenough visibility on what's happeninglet's run this let's run this and seewhat happensI'll just start the server againCtrl C oh sorry I've decided the serverI started the server and nowwe got the first statement it is waitingfor a client to connect which is exactlywhat we wantedand now I'll fire this client processingthe requestand when I fire the curl from here wedid not see anything getting printedthere we saw waiting for the client toconnect it then it returned hello worldthere then it waited for client toconnect and now we would see Hello Worldover here you see the execution issequential because we waited for 8seconds the total execution actuallyhappened for roughly 16 secondsright this is what why why is ithappening because the for Loop that wewrote is happening one after another sounless so what this shows us is let merun it one more time so that it justbecomes crystal clear that I hit curlover here I hit call over here you seeone process getting required like onerequest getting processed that gotresponded and then another processhappening now after eight seconds thiswould get Hello World in response so theexecution is actually sequentialhey this is what is happening so if Itake you through the source code whichis exactly what we wrote and we can'texpect anything else to be done what weare doing is we are waiting for a clientto connect once the client is connectedwe are doing something while we aredoing something in which we are readingthe request processing it sending theresponse and once that is done then weare waiting for the client to connect sothe server that we wrote is cannothandle concurrent request coming in theserver that we wrote can only handle onerequest at a timewhich is what it shows because this isprecisely what we wrote as a code thisprecisely what a single threaded serveris that on that's one server that youhave you are not able to accept multiplerequests because that's what our code isor we have an infinite for Loop we areaccepting a client or we are accepting aconnection then we are doing someprocessing and then we are returning weare closing the connection and then thecircle continues so unless and until wecome back to this line very quickly likewe want to reach here as fast aspossible but until this functionexecution completes we cannot come backover herethat's the thing that's the thing thatwe would want to address so what do wedo this is precisely precisely wheremulti-threaded server comes in parallelprocessing so what we can do iswhile we are accepting the connectionand then we are processing it our dofunction what if we do that do part in athread what would happen so when I amaccepting the connection and I'm doingthat processing what if that doing of orhandling the request happens in aseparate thread once that is spawnedinto a separate thread my main threadcan go back to the top of the for loopagain very quickly and make the acceptsystem call waiting for it to accept theclient or waiting for it or sorrywaiting for the client to make aconnectionwon't that work that's precisely whatmulti-threaded server does so the onlychange that I'll do over here is ingolang I can create a simple go routinelike this I can just prefix my statementwith go it would run it as a separate goroutine now what would happen now if Irun this exact same thing as my code nowlet's see if we can handle multiplerequest at once I'll start at the serverid.com I came back here I did occur andyou see immediately is this gettingprinted and I'm processing the requestand you see the First Response gettinghello world and immediately two secondslater we see second request gettinghello world we did not have to wait for8 seconds per second second thing tocome out so here we see that howmultiple requests now our server canhandle multiple requests at once themagic was that we wanted to invokeexcept as soon as possiblewe did not wait for the processing ofthe first request to complete before wecould go to accept which is why what wedid we spawned it into a separate threadwhich is precisely what multi-threadedserver doesright so let me once again show you thedemo so that it becomes crystal clear Iam invoking curl you see the messagegetting printed I'll invoke curl overhere you see message getting printedboth the requests are being handledconcurrently by my server in twoseparate threads first request respondedand now the second request to it respondthat's the beauty of this implementationthis is precisely what multi-threadedserver doesand this is how beat any programminglanguage be it any framework that yousee like Gene framework or flask orgionicon or any web server that youwrite which can handle multiple requestswhich are multi-threaded web servers ormulti-threaded TCP servers this isprecisely what they dothis is precisely what they do is whenthey are waiting so their main thread isconstantly just in this for Loop waitingfor a client to connectright whenever a client connects theyspin out or they spin of a thread tohandle that request independently andthen it waits again they for not anotherthreat and then it waits again and so onand so forth this way any multi-threadedserver handles the mult handles multipleincoming requests concurrently rightokay there is another class of TCPservers which are single threaded butthey can still handle multiple requestsI have covered it in my radius internalcourse in case you are interested youcan check out the link is in thedescription so but here our Focus was tounderstand multi-threaded servers soagain just to reiterate there is also acategory of single threaded serverswhich handles multiple concurrent TCPconnections the way they do it is littleinternals it's part of my Reddit scoresso I won't put it out in this video butnow you see what happens like how youcan build your own multi-threaded webserver right this is precisely whathappens behind the scenes and this ishow you build multi-threaded web serverso just understand like herethe baby went for it was that weunderstood what each system called itlike except read write we knew they wereblocking which is why what we did is assoon as we knew that our server wouldnot be able to accept the request unlesswe invoke the accept system call so wewaited so what we did we did it in themain thread while as soon as a clientconnected we fogged out a threadspecifically for that request to behandled which is exactly what ishappening so for every client that isconnected we are forking out thisrequest into a separate thread and thenit does its own read and process andlike e-read processing write and out andclosing right this is the idea this iswhat every single web server does so nowhere you start seeing some problemsproblem number one what if a largenumber of client connects to This Serverwhen a large number of clients connectto the server what would happen ifwhenever a client is getting connectedthey are immediately invoking a newthread to handle that particular requestso when a large number of clientconnects to This Server what wouldhappen for every request a new thread isspun up thread overload or rather therewould be huge number of threads on mymachinethat's not good which is where there area bunch of optimizations that needs tobe done which all multi-threaded serverdoes first of all you typically don'tspin up a new thread a new thread forevery request you have to limit themaximum number of threads which yourserver would be spinning up because aserver is not just accepting the requestand handling it the handling part itselfwould require multiple threads becausethere is this Hardware limit of theamount of memory in the CPU and theresources that you have you cannot justspin up infinitely large number ofthreads over there so which is where youwould have to limit the maximum numberof threads that you can invoke so that'swhat it does now for you to do thatthere is something called as a threadpool what would you do is you would spinup a thread pool that contains let's saythousand threads and whenever you need athread you go to the thread pool readthe thread do the processing and thenput the thread back to thread pull thisway you limit the number of threads thatyour process would ever havethen you would have you would needconnection timeout what if a client isconnected you are waiting for somethingwhat if that client never sends you therequest you cannot just infinitely waitbecause you are just hogging up a TCPconnection so what you need you need aconnection timeout so whenever a newthread is perked out there is a timeoutassociated with it that if my threaddoes not respond or if my client doesnot respond in that much of time I wouldkill that connection right so that'swhat happens with connection timeout andthe final one there's something calledas a TCP backlog queue which is anoperating system level setting that thatdetermines how many connections youwould want to keep in your backright just Google about it it's quite aninteresting field to explore so yeahthat's how you create a multi-thread webserver I hope I was able to spark someinterest on the internal side of thingsthe idea being that you just apply abasic first principles while buildinganything and you can literally buildanything around it right so yeah now youunderstood what system calls are why arethey blocking how multi-threaded webservers are even conceptualized and whatother factors you need to consider toimprove the performance of your web ofany multi-threaded web server now bebeat any web server Tomcat you pickspring boots or whatever they are usingG unicorn nginx all of them any serverthat is multi-threaded you can literallyopen that source code and you can seesomething very similar to this reallyvery similar to this and this is whatthe beauty of first principle thinkingis all about so yeah that's all what Iwanted to cover in this one I hope youfound it interesting hope you found itamazing that's it for this one I'll seein the next one thanksthank you[Music]thank you",
    "summary": "This YouTube video explains how multi-threaded TCP servers work by building one from scratch using Go. It begins by defining a TCP server as a process that listens on a specific port and accepts connections. The video demonstrates setting up a basic server that reserves a port, listens for connections, and then closes upon receiving one. It highlights the crucial role of system calls like `accept`, `read`, and `write` in this process, emphasizing their blocking nature.\n\nThe tutorial then walks through expanding the server to read incoming requests, perform rudimentary processing (simulated by a sleep function), and send back an HTTP response, complete with headers. It demonstrates how to loop the `accept` function, but highlights how the single-threaded nature of that approach prevents it from handling concurrent requests effectively, since it must fully handle a single request before it can listen for another. This leads to the core concept of multi-threading, achieved by using Go routines.\n\nThe video modifies the code to spin off a new Go routine (thread) to handle each incoming connection, allowing the main thread to return immediately to the `accept` call. This makes the server able to handle multiple requests at the same time. The video concludes by acknowledging further optimizations needed for production-ready servers, such as thread pools to limit the number of threads, connection timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion from unresponsive clients, and TCP backlog queues to handle pending connections. The presenter encourages viewers to apply first principles when building complex systems and offers insights on other TCP architectures."

    "transcript": "Vibe coding is growing in SiliconValley. Vibe coding. Vibe coding. Vibecoding. Been vibe coding. Vibe coding isthe future. Vibe coding. Vibe codingseems like everyone's favorite buzzword,but I'm not necessarily sure it reallymeans anything. On one hand, it's thething that we expect to do when we usesome AI codegen tool and spit out abunch of code and never look at it andmake features. But on the other hand,there's a bunch of books coming out onhow to be a good vibe coding engineer.And I'm not sure that these definitionsmake sense at all anymore. BIPE codingis a cool concept that started whenCarpathy made a post about how he'sthinking about code and not thinkingabout code more importantly. But nowsince the term is so cool feel like it'sbeing used in places that make no senseat all. I felt this way for a while butI started feeling it much more stronglywhen Simon Willis made this post. Ifyou're not already reading Simon's blog,I highly recommend it. Not just becausehe covered my SnitchBench thingrecently, but because he's the creatorof Django and he's quickly become one ofmy favorite people in the AI world. Hecame in late, similar to me. Not as lateas me at all, but came in somewhat late.Quickly established a awesome spot beinglike realistic but also excited aboutwhat these things can do. One of themore reasonable AI bros by far. And thispost hit me hard because it's a thingI've already felt that he put reallysimply. And I want to dig in a lotfurther here because I at this pointdon't even know if vibe coding is a realthing. So, before we can dive into whatthe hell vibe coding is, we have somebills to pay. So, quick word fromtoday's sponsor and then we'll getstarted. I need to be honest with youguys. I'm scared for people trying tolearn today. Be it a new developerlearning from scratch or an experienceddeveloper trying to pick up a new toolor part of the stack. Making sure youfind reliable resources that aren't someAI hallucinated slop is super difficult.If you don't know what you're doing yet,making sure you're learning from theright people is really hard. And that'swhy I'm hyped about today's sponsor,Frontend Masters. You've been around fora while. You know how skeptical I am ofcourses. Sure. You know the old phrase,those who do do and those who can't doteach. But what if you put together aset of courses that were madeexclusively by people who are alreadydoing? And what if their jobs andcompanies were so relevant that youwould put their names right underneaththe name of the instructor? That's whatyou get with these guys because RichardFeldman built an IDE from scratch inRust. Or Melky, who is still somehowemployed at Twitch. Okay, joking.Melky's a good friend. He knows hisstuff really well. And you've probablyseen his videos, too. If you want tolearn Golang, there are a few betterplaces to go than him. Or JohnCoopermanman, who's one of the mostlegendary people in the TypeScript andwebdev world working over at Bloomberg.You got Prime in here, who used to workat Hulu or something. I don't remember.You got Katie, is one of the smartestpeople in the React Native community.Seeing her in here actually gets mereally hyped. I kind of want to gothrough those courses myself once westart building the T3 chat app. If youhaven't already made the plunge and youhave a job, there's a good chance yourcompany will let you spend the educationbudget on front-end masters. Either way,if you use my link, you'll get 25% off.So check them out today atsoyv.link/masters.So as Simon puts it in this post, twopublishers and three authors fail tounderstand what vibe coding means. Vibecoding does not mean using AI tools tohelp write code. When you are inside ofcursor and you click command K and tellit to do something and it does it or youtab complete as you're making changes,none of that is vibe coding. Those areusing AI tools to assist yourdevelopment process. Vibe coding is whenyou command I and go in here and alsoclose all of the files and never look atthe code. I would go as far as makingthe argument that you can't vibe codingand cursor because once it starts makingthe changes you have to look at thecode. It always does. Whereas on aplatform like lovable, which if I recalldid not initially even have a code tabwhen it shipped. It was just the view ofthe thing that it was building. That'svibe coding. When you're using AI togenerate changes to a thing or evengenerate it from scratch, not evenlooking at the code, just running thething, and if it does get an error, youcopy paste the error into the chat andsay, \"Fix it.\" Give it no additionalcontext and trust the AI to vibe it outand make it happen. That's vibe coding.I'd make the argument that coding andvibe coding are almost like opposites.They are diametrically opposed. You areeither coding or you are vibe coding.You can assist the coding process withAI, but vibe coding is replacing thecoding process. It is an alternative tocoding. As we mentioned before, the termwas coined by Carpathy at the beginningof 2025, back in February. A lot ofpeople asked if T3 chat was vibe coded.Vibe coding wasn't a thing when T3 Chatwas built. T3 Chat came out a few weeksbefore the word vibe coding existed. AsCarpathy puts it, there's a new kind ofcoding that I call vibe coding, whereyou fully give into the vibes, embraceexponentials, and forget that the codeeven exists. It's possible because theLLMs like Cursor Composer with Sonnetare getting too good. Also, I just talkto Composer with Super Whisper, so Ibarely even touch the keyboard. I askfor the dumbest things, like decreasethe padding on the sidebar by halfbecause I'm too lazy to find it. Iaccept all always. I don't read thediffs anymore. When I get errormessages, I just copy paste them in withno comment. Usually that fixes it. Thecode grows beyond my usualcomprehension. I'd have to really readthrough it for a while. Sometimes theLMS can't fix a bug, so I just workaround it or ask for random changesuntil it goes away. It's not too bad fora throwaway weekend project, but stillquite amusing. I'm building a project ora web app, but I'm not really coding. Ijust see stuff, say stuff, run stuff,copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.There are a couple key points here thatI would argue are key for the definitionof vibe coding. Otherwise, the term isuseless. So, by Carpathy's definition,not reading diffs is key. Not too badfor throwaway weekend projects. Theexact quote I think is important to putin here is I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding. That isreally key here. And the general conceptof giving in to the vibes and giving upon the code.These are the key pieces in my mind towhat makes vibe coding. While he doesuse cursor for it, he emphasizes that hedoesn't look at any of the code. He evensays that he forgets the code exists. Alot of ways you can do that. You canhide it in the UI. You can refuse toread it when it comes up. You canintentionally glaze over it when you'rescrolling past it. but not readingdiffs, focusing on throwaway projectsand one-off things that don't have to bemaintained, having more code than youwould ever comprehend or care to gothrough, much less write yourself. Allof these things are what makes vibecoding vibe coding. And as Simon puts inthis other really good blog post, I'mconcerned the definition is alreadyescaping its original intent. I'm seeingpeople apply the term vibe coding to allforms of code written with theassistance of AI. I think that bothdilutes the term and gives a falseimpression of what's possible withresponsible AI assisted programming.Vibe coding is not the same thing aswriting code with the help of LLMs. Oh,look at that. He even bold the thingshere. Forget the code even exists. It'snot too bad for throwaway projects, butit is quite amusing. And similar to me,Simon thinks that this definition isreally good. It is very useful as a termto distinguish between the differenttypes of AI coding tools. We have thingslike tab complete, which used to be theco-pilot experience. But now co-pilot isthe most diluted term in the world, evenmore so than AI. So calling somethingco-pilot-like, means literally nothing.When you tell me something isco-pilotike, the immediate thought thatcomes to mind is the app that every timeI turn on the desktop I film thesevideos on automatically comes up inWindows with a new unique error codeevery time it opens. That's what I thinkof when I hear co-pilot like. So thatterm is gone. We can't use that anymore.Tab completeis enough. I guess it helps. And now I'mat the point where I refer to thesespecific key bindings when I try todescribe a flow. The inline prompting incursor I just call command K cuz that'sthe key combo you hit to do it. Andthere isn't a better like shorthand termfor it. I guess like inline promptediting maybe, but I've never heardanyone say that. Then there's command Iwhich has become the agentic AI codeediting. I just call it command I thoughand a lot of other people do too. Thesedifferent hotkeys might seem like asilly way to distinguish, but it's theeasiest way to explain what thing you'retalking about and what feature you'rethinking about. And vibe coding is avery different thought. It's a differentway of thinking about and framing thesethings. It's one where this isn't justfor people who know how to write code tomake their code writing more effective.This is for people who may or may notknow how to write code that are choosingto not bother reading it. As Simon says,Carpathy is an extremely talented andexperienced programmer. He has no needfor AI assistance at all. Anotherimportant thing, you don't need to be agood or bad or non-programmer to vibecode. A great programmer can vibe codeby not reading the code. And a badprogrammer or non-programmer can vibecode because they can't do anything withthe code part. Anyways, Kyper is usingLLMs like this because it's fun to tryout wild new ideas. and the speed atwhich an LLM can produce code is anorder of magnitude faster than even themost skilled human programmer. For lowstakes projects and prototypes, why notjust let it rip? When I talk about vibecoding, I mean building software with anLLM without reviewing the code itwrites. Huge really good key distinctionhere as well from Simon. We need termsto describe the different types of waysyou could integrate AI into your codingprocess. But as soon as you're talkingabout what percentage of your code baseis coded with AI, you're no longer vibecoding. Like if somebody says that theircode base is 70% vibecoded, I don't knowif I even believe them. I would say it'sprobably less because you look at thecode, you see it when you make otherchanges to the code, you are paying someattention. And even I when I I vibecoded the snitchbench ben benchmark, Idid not write a single line of code inone of the two giant files in thatcodebase. But I did read a decent bit ofit. Not a lot of it, but enough of it. Iwouldn't call it vibe coding because Iwas paying attention to the code itwrote. I wasn't just paying attention tothe outputs. I would argue that vibecoding is almost a ratio between howmuch are you paying attention to thecode versus how much are you payingattention to the output like productthat comes out of the thing that youbuilt. The ratio there specifically theratio on the code side being zero whereyou're not looking at the code at all.That's what defines vibe coding. Alsoimportant to note that using LMS forcode responsibly is not vibe coding atall. Things like using code rabbit orgraphites diamond to review your code isvery far from vibe coding. Things likeusing command I and reading the diffsand rejecting the changes and asking itto do something differently. That's notvibe coding. Anytime you're in the codeis not vibe coding. Somebody asked inchat, is this like saying you're notdoing test driven development if youdon't have 100% test coverage? No. Thisis like saying you're not doingtest-driven development if you'rewriting the code before you write thetests. This isn't about the percentage,but if the percentage is 100 or zero,it's usually a good indicator. The factthat people are calling any AIinvolvement in their code vibe codingmakes the term go from an actual usefulindicator of this specific thing toentirely useless to the point where itshould be thrown out. I think we mighteven be over that line now where I don'tuse the term often because everyonethinks of something different when I sayvibe coding. Some people think that whatI'm doing in cursor is vibe coding. Somepeople think lovable and bolt are theways that you vibe code. Some peoplethink tab complete is vibe coding. Ilike having terms to distinguish betweenthese things. Both because I liketalking about them and making contentabout them, but also because we need tounderstand these things with language.And the language we're using needs to beconcrete and with definitions we agreeon. And I'm doing my best to help us allagree on the definition here. Especiallybecause there are two books coming outthat are not vibe coding. This oneimmediately contradicts itself. Vibecoding building production gradesoftware with genai chat agents andbeyond. I'm not going to blame theauthors because the authors probablydidn't pick the title. The publisher didbecause they want to get on the hypebandwagon. They want to make somethingthat people will buy. The issue is thatthis book probably isn't useful topeople who are learning how to code andgetting into building via vibe coding.So if a non-dev buys this because vibecoding is the thing they're gettinginto, and this book is written for realexperienced programmers trying to use AImore, which is what it seems like withthis title and subtitle. That is a supermisleading thing. To use a testdevelopment example again, imagine if Imade a book titled test-drivendevelopment. How to build type- safeside projects effectively with tests.That's not what test-driven developmentis. The fact that you're saying sideprojects indicates that this isn'tactually about test-driven developmentat all. You just want to show me how toadd tests to a thing. Or even better,better example, test-driven development.How to strategically add tests toexisting projects. That's not what TDDis. It's the opposite of what TDD is.Adding tests after means you're notdriven by the tests. Test-drivendevelopment means that your developmentis driven by the tests. Vibe codingmeans that you are not reading the code.This frustrates me so much. Or vibecoding the future of programming.Leverage your experience in the age ofAI. Are you joking? And this one breaksme because I love Adi Osmani. He's oneof my favorite people in the space. Butwe all know O'Reilly Media picked thistitle. I love this point from Simon aswell. I wonder if this is a new recordfor the time that a term was coined tothe first published books using the termentirely incorrectly. That is kind ofcrazy that in February this term wascoined and 3 months later we now havebooks being published that use it wrong.It's kind of nuts. Job of a dev is notjust to churn out code and features. Weneed to create code that demonstrabablyworks and can be understood by otherhumans and machines that will supportcontinued development in the future.Again, like Simon's not some crazydiluted AI, bro. These are all going toget replaced with like random agents and He wants good engineering and AIassistance all happen because all ofthese things can be good and vibe codingcan be good too as a way to do thingsthat matter less. As he says, we alsoneed to read the code. My golden rulefor production quality AI systemprogramming is that I won't commit anycode to my repo if I couldn't explainexactly what it does to somebody else. Ilove this. Shout this from the mountaintops. Don't merge code that you don'tunderstand. An LLM wrote the code foryou and you then reviewed it, tested itthoroughly, and made sure you couldexplain how it works to someone else.That's not vibe coding. It's softwaredevelopment. The usage of an LLM tosupport that activity is immaterial.poof bars. And the reason that bothSimon and I are mad, as I've hinted at abunch, is that we shouldn't lose trackof what makes Vibe coding special. Bothbecause we need the term, but alsobecause it enables a new type ofbuilding that wasn't really a thingbefore. A big part of why I made the T3stack is it was too hard to glue all theparts together to make something simplequickly. And I used it to build a bunchof small, simple apps that solved realproblems that I had. That was a skillthat used to make me really unique. Thefact that I could build a product inunder a week that was actually useful topeople was one of the big selling pointsof why you would bring me into your teamor why you would listen to my takes onengineering. AI has made it so mostprogrammers can do that. And even somenon-programmers can too, depending onthe thing that they're building. That isawesome. I don't feel like I am at a bigloss now that everyone else can buildsomething from scratch as fast as I usedto do it 5 years ago. I think that'sawesome. I love the fact that morepeople can vibe out a project. Andhonestly, the vibecoded stuff thatthey're building is probably similarquality of code to the first twoversions of Pic thing that I threwtogether in a day or two because I justwanted to make the thing work. And nowmost people can make the thing workrelatively quickly. Going from themindset of like building enterpriseready everything to making a thinguseful as quickly as possible wassomething I was lucky enough to havehappen early in my career, but even forme it was a hard shift to like stopstuffing GraphQL into everything whereit's not needed. Vibe coding is helpingothers experience that of like lettinggo and knowing something is not idealbut not caring because you just want thething to work. I'm not saying that myway of coding 5 years ago was fivecoding at all. It's not. But vibe codingis a path to a similar outcome which Ithink is really cool. Another importantpoint is that we shouldn't let vibecoding become this negative termspecifically associated withirresponsible AI assisted programming.Like when people say, \"Oh, that outagewas probably because they vibecoded it.\"That's not right. It's both almostcertainly not true and even if it was isnot a good way to use the term becausethe point of it is that you're using iton low stakes things that you'rethrowing together. It's giving everyonethis ability to build something quickerand more effectively by not caring aboutthings they shouldn't care about. Thesame way that I love Versel becausespinning everything up serverless meansI get to stop thinking about a ton ofdifferent problems. Vibe coding lets youdo that for the entire codebase if itmakes sense for the thing you're doing.Versel doesn't make sense for everybackend. Vibe coding doesn't make sensefor every project, but where it does,it's really useful and powerful. Youshouldn't need a computer science degreeor programming boot camp in order to getcomputers to do extremely specific tasksfor you. If you need a calculator tokeep track of a specific grind you aredoing in World of Warcraft, or you needa dashboard to keep track of this weirdcollection of things that you have foryour small consignment shop, youshouldn't have to force another tool notbuilt for you to fit your needs,especially if you're not a developer.You should be able to make somethingthat might not be perfect. It might noteven be good, but it's good enough foryou and your bespoke needs. That shouldbe accessible to everybody. And that'swhat Vibe Coding is meant to do. Andit's really cool. Even if right nowmostly actual developers are doing it,more and more non-devs are and that isan awesome thing both because they cansolve real problems but also they canstart learning more about code andseeing that it's accessible to buildthese types of things. Bip coding is agateway to get people into creatingsoftware and as a way for people tosolve a problem without thinking aboutthe code. Those are two really powerfulthings that we will lose if we swap itout. So this term is used for all AIcoding or for bad AI coding. If vibecoding grants millions of new people theability to build their own custom tools,I could not be happier about it. That isSimon's quote. And I fully agree. Someof these people will get bitten by theprogramming bug and go on to becomeproficient software devs. One of thebiggest barriers to that profession isthe incredibly steep learning curve,especially at the start. Vibe codingshaves that initial barrier down toalmost flat. A thing I talk about a lotis time to smile. from the time somebodystarts doing the thing to the time theythey smile for the first time where itworked or it happened and they'reexcited about it. How long does it taketo get over that? I'm really lucky thatI learned how to skateboard when I wasyounger because it takes a long time togo from standing on a board for thefirst time to being proud of a thing youdid. It takes months, if not years, tolike land your first oie. It took me twoyears to go from the oie to the kickflip and I learned a tre flip like a dayor two later, which is a much hardertrick. But that feeling that that vibeso to speak of I want to do this thingto wow I'm making progress. This feelslike something I can do because it's sohard to land that first oie that thevast majority of people who try give upbefore they get there. It makes the endmuch more rewarding. But if you don'tsee the end, if you can't imagine whatit will be like to be there, you'llnever get there. It's the same reasonthere aren't many programmers because ittakes so long to go from reading thisesoteric language, all these weirdsymbols you don't know to it doing thething you want it to do. This is why Ilike tools like React and Next and StackBlitz and all the cool things that theReact docs have done because it letssomebody go from I want to figure outcode to I made this change and thisthing happened and I feel like I'mstarting to understand it and then theysmile because they're making progressand they can feel it. Vibe coding getsyou that first smile so much faster. Itmakes you feel like you can do it. Andif you then run into a bug that makeslife way harder and you have to go divein and fix it, at least you have a paththere. You don't have to rely on somesmarter person to hold your hand throughit like I and many other devs did. Youdon't have to go spend a bunch of moneyon a college that doesn't even teach youhow to do these things in the firstplace. You start by letting go and justtrying to make the thing happen and thenride the wave from there. I would expectthere to be a ton of incredibly talenteddevs that get in through this and I amexcited to see where they go. With allthat said, should probably talk aboutwhen is it okay to vibe code. If you'rean experienced engineer, this is likelyobvious to you already. So, I'm writingthis section for people who are justgetting started. Project should be lowstakes. Think about how much harm thecode you're writing could cause if ithas bugs or vulnerabilities. Couldsomeone be harmed, damaged reputation,lost money, or something worse?particularly important if you plan onbuilding software that will be used byother people. That's a big detail there.If you're building things that are justfor yourself, who cares? Like when Ibuilt the first two versions of P thing,they were just for me. They were poorlyarchitected, tons of bad decisions. Ididn't have to worry about otherengineers contributing, so I didn'tcare. I didn't have to worry about otherpeople using it, so I really didn'tcare. But then when it was time for meto put it out for others to use, Iliterally started a third repo andrewrote the whole thing from scratch sothat it was in a state that people couldactually use it and I would be confidentin the safety of the product. Code thatyou vibe code you should be more thanokay with throwing away entirely becauseit it's disposable. That's the point.It's also important to considersecurity. Watch out for secrets, thingslike passwords and API keys. There'salways been a problem people leakingtheir API keys and things, but it'sgetting worse now more than ever. If youdon't know what an API key is, I don'tknow how the hell you stumbled into thisvideo. Be careful about what you build,please. Data privacy is also a reallybig concern. It's also important to be agood network citizen. A makes requestsout to other platforms could increaseload as well as cost on those services.Plot artifacts apparently keep you frommaking requests out. That's a cool thingto see. It's very easy to accidentallyscrew over someone else if you'rebuilding a tool on top of their tool andyou hit some endpoint that the AI finds.I've definitely caused some damage toSoundCloud with hitting APIs. You're notsupposed to. So, I know that feeling.And of course, is your money on theline. Seen horror stories about peoplewho vibe coded a feature, get some APIwithout a billing limit, and racked upthousands of dollars in charges. Be verycareful about using vibe coding againstanything that's charged based on usage.Fully agree. Simon has a section on howdo we make vibe coding better. Links inthe description if you want to readthis. All of his posts are great, but Ihighly recommend these ones. Wrap it upwith go forth and vibe code. I agreewith the sentiment here too. Simon sayspeople should not feel discouraged and Itotally agree. Vibe coding is reallycool both for figuring out what thesetools are capable of and unlocking theability in your brain to throw togethersomething you wouldn't have botheredwith before. A project that might havetaken 3 to 4 days and not been thatuseful before can now be done in 1 totwo hours. It might be prettier lookingin some ways. It might be lessfunctional in others. It might be codeyou never want to touch again. It mightuse a framework you don't even like. Butyou can vibe code out something usefulto you hilariously quickly. And throughthat you get to see so much of thecapabilities of these tools, of thesemodels, of these agents and quotes andthe things that they call. You can learna lot about both how powerful AI is andmore importantly, you can rethink whenit makes sense to spin up a real projectwith developers versus a quick littlething on the side. There's a lot you canlearn from and a lot you can changeabout how you build regardless of howexperienced you are. Vibe coding is auseful thing to learn for most engineersand I have been very surprised at mywillingness to vibe code since I took asimilar stance. I wouldn't have donethings like the cloneon if it wasn't forvibe coding. Not because I think peopleshould vibe code their T3 chat clone,but because the clone submission portaland all of that was annoying to buildand I was able to vibe code out thestarting point very easily. And there'sa lot of these types of projects that Ipreviously would have put on the backlogand never gotten to that suddenly makemuch more sense. So if you are scared ofvibe coding, if you hate vibe coding, ifyou think the term should be used forall the other things, I'd recommendsitting down and actually trying it theway that Simon and Carpathy and nowmyself describe it. Because while it isnot the right way to build realproduction enterprise software, it iscertainly a good way to throw somethingtogether that otherwise might not existat all. Let me know what you guys think.Until next time, keep vibing.",
    "summary": "The video \"Vibe Coding\" Is A Stupid Trend argues that \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by Andrej Karpathy, is being misused and misunderstood. The speaker, \"Theo\" (soyv.link), clarifies that vibe coding is *not* simply using AI tools to assist in coding (like tab completion or inline prompting). Instead, it's a distinct approach where the developer relies heavily on AI to generate code, focusing on the output and functionality without scrutinizing or even understanding the code itself. Key elements of vibe coding include not reading diffs, accepting AI suggestions without review, working on throwaway projects, and accepting code beyond one's comprehension. The speaker emphasizes that \"coding\" and \"vibe coding\" are almost opposites; one involves understanding and control, the other involves trust and a \"let it rip\" attitude.\n\nTheo cautions against the dilution of the term, as it's becoming synonymous with any AI-assisted coding. This misuse undermines its original intent: enabling rapid prototyping and custom tool creation, especially for non-developers. He stresses that it's valuable for low-stakes projects where speed and immediate results are prioritized over maintainability or robustness. However, vibe coding is inappropriate for production-grade software, projects involving sensitive data, or any scenario where code quality and security are paramount. The speaker and Simon Willis are concerned that two books using \"Vibe Coding\" in the title are misusing the word and are not reflective of what vibe coding is.\n\nUltimately, the video defends the potential of true vibe coding as a gateway for newcomers to enter software development. By lowering the initial learning curve and making it easier to achieve quick results, vibe coding can empower individuals to build custom solutions and spark an interest in programming. The speaker encourages viewers to embrace vibe coding for appropriate use cases while emphasizing the importance of understanding the code for production-level applications. In short, vibe coding is not simply applying AI code generation tools, but an overall approach to development where understanding the code is not an objective."

    "transcript": "[Music]If you haven't been vi coding enough,you must have experienced problem whereyou ask cursor to implement a smallchange but just map up your wholeproject or cursor is not aware of allthe dependencies in your codebase andimplement something that leads to loadsof errors. This is a very common issueof AI coding agent in general no matterwhich platform you're using. But there'sone technique that show promisingimprovements that will make your cursormake way less errors, which is givingyour AI coding agent a task managementsystem. It helps it to understandoverall implementation plan and alsocontrol the amount of context goes intoeach step when it is implementingspecific tasks. I was able to build afully functional multiplayer onlinedrawing game where both players can drawimage of given work and we send theresult to GBD4 where it look at imageand give evaluation and pick up thewinner. And this whole game is actuallyimprinted by cursor with just one shotwithout much arrow which is absolutelyinsane. That's why today I want to showyou what my workflow is and how can youadopt it for your own project. Andbefore you use any of those tools I justintroduced people has been hackingtogether task management workflow toimprove performance for a while. At itscore it basically means you ask cursorto break down your complex PRD intosmall tasks and have a document wherecursor can have access to to track andmaintain what tasks are coming and whattasks already been done. And this is aquick example from Elle. The most basicimplementation is in your cursor projectyou will create a cursor rule and itlooks something like this. Basicallyrule where you tell cursor to alwaysrefer to task.md to keep track aboutwhat task they already been done andwhat task haven't. And with this one wecan just create a task.md file and givea prompt I want to build a x app help mebreaking down into small task of ourcore me feature and add to task.md. Socursor will create a list of task hereand after cursor finish every singletask it will just come back and marthose task as completed. So it has acontext of overall implementation plan.With this method it already help a tonfor executing complex task with cursor.But tools like cloud taskmaster andboomeran task from ruk code bring evenmore sophisticated task managementbehavior into the AI coding agents. Forexample, for task master AI, it is acommand line package that you can run incursor windsurf data where it utilizecloud 3.7 or more advanced model to lookat PRD you have and break that down intosmall subtasks by running a simplecommand line like taskmaster parse PRD.And what's really amazing about it isthat it will breaking down tasks inlogical order consider all thedependencies between different tasks. Soyou won't have situation where cursorimplements something but require otherdependencies that hasn't beenimplemented yet. It also has usefulcommand line like analyze complexitiesto use perplexity and cloud to analyzehow complicated each task is and ifcertain task complexity score is veryhigh it will allow you to expand onthose task further and by breaking downthose complex tasks into even smallerbits. The success rate of it deliveringa functional application just increasedramatically. And Roco's boomeran taskalso something similar. It gives AIagents tools like new tasks to breakingdown a complex project into small bitsand keep track about progress. Thosetools have completely changed myworkflow. So I'm going to quickly takeyou through what's my new best practicevibe coding workflow with those newtools. But before we dive into that, Iknow many of you are trying to build AIagents for business. But there are manypitfalls I saw people fell into atdelivering successful production agents.That's why I want to introduce you tothis research HubSpot did where theyinterviewed tons of business andstartups who have been launching AIagents for the past 12 months tounderstand which AI agent use caseactually drove huge amount of businessvalue and ROI versus ones that soundsfancy but actually very difficult todeliver value and which signal customersare deploying huge amount of budgets tobuy AI agent solution. They include lotsof real world success stories andarticulate those learnings intoframeworks that you can use to buildyour next agents from which use casesmore suitable for chatbot versus actualautopilot agents. How do you determinewhich task is best for AI agents versusmore traditional workflow automation aswell as list of common pitfalls thatmany other people encounter includingmyself when deploying production agentsand best practice of how other peopleresolve that like what's the bestpractice for you to build integrationinto existing systems. This helped bringa lot of clarities and many mistakes Ipersonally experienced. So if you'replanning to build agents, I highlyrecommend you go and have a read andthis is totally free. I have put a linkin the description below for you todownload. Now let's talk about my new AIcoding workflow with task managementsystems. Firstly, let's talk about rucode's boomer task feature. And if youdon't know ru code, ro code you canalmost consider as a open-source cursorthat live inside visual studio code. Itis totally free to use. All you need todo is just provide your own entropy keyand then it will just work like anyother AI coding agent that you've beenusing. But what's really cool about realcode is that unlike cursor where youonly have a few predefined agent mode,Ro allow you to create your own modeslike at default they will provide codingagent architect agent that will help youdo the planning debug agent that helpyou figure out where the arrow is. Butyou can also build custom modes likeboomer wrench mode where it will befocusing on planning and breaking downthe plan into smaller manageable pieces.Think of it like delegating your work tospecialized assistant. Each subtask runsin its own context. So I can choose aboomer range mode that I just customizedand then say help me build a to-do app.At top you can see that it will keeptrack about how many token consumptionis as well as total amount of API costand it will firstly delegate a planningtask to the architect agent and thisarchitect agent will have this systemprompt where it will continuouslyconfirm with me about the requirementsand then it will start planning out theproject breaking down into specificfeature figure out things like userstory key feature components projectstructure state management and manymore. So it has a full understandingabout all dependencies between differentfunctions. I can give feedback in themiddle and once the plan is finished andbreaking down to small tasks, it canswitch to the code mode to startgenerating the code and the code agentwill start executing different tasksbased on the plan and then complete theactual application for me. And you cansee the result here is very high qualityand it even have functionality built inwhere the agent will be able to run theapplication in the browser, see theresult to automate testing as well. Andwith this one, the result already feelsbetter than what I got out of box fromcursor. But on the other hand, cloudtaskmaster integrate much more deeplyinto cursor and wings surfer. First,let's install the taskmaster AI. You canopen terminal in any folder and do npminstall-gtaskmaster-ai. And once it's finished,you can run a few different commands.One will be taskmaster in it. This willset up the project inside the folder.So, you can just do taskmaster in itdirectly. But I would suggest you set upthe project first. Like if you'rebuilding a nextjs project with chessen,you can just do this command. And onceit's done, we can do cursor my app.Inside here, we can do taskmaster in it.This will ask for the pent name and I'lljust call it my app. Description doesn'treally matter. You can skip all thosestuff and then just let it set thingsup. And what will happen now is that onthe left side you firstly see it add afew cursor rule. Some of them aregeneric one like this cursor rulebasically teach cursor how can it addnew cursor rules. So as you go deep intothe implementation you can ask it toreflect and creating rules about themistake it make for example and it willfollow this rules to create the nextcursor rules and this self-improve isbasically the same thing it kind of tryto get cursor to do this proactively andthe step workflow is where it teachcursor about all the commands it willneed to actually check all the task inthe backlog and if you're usingwindserve there will be windserve roothere as well inside the scripts folderit provide a structure about what does aprd can look like but the most importantone is that it will have thisv.examexample file. What you need to do isswap out this entropic key as well asproplasticity key here. So entropy is amodel that will be used to break downyour PRD into small tasks and they alsouse perlastity to do some research. Soif part of task is using a new packagethat just released then it will actuallyuse perlasty to fetch the latestdeveloper documents and include thoseinto the task information. So Irecommend you add both API key here andonce you did that we can start creatingour PRD. There are many different waysyou can create PRDs. If you're in the AIbuilder climate building already, youwill have access to tools like tankscoder the dev where it will help yougenerate PRD automatically and fill inall the gaps for the features that youmight not think of. So if you're alreadyin the AI build club, you can use thistool to get the PRD here. But if youdon't have access, you can also justchat with cursor agent use that to helpyou generate PRD. For example, I canjust say help me build an online gamelike Scribble, but instead of a humanguess word, it will be large model guessa word. So each round all users will begiven a same word and they have 60seconds to draw the image. In the endall images will be sent to open 4 andlet it choose which image is closest tothe word. Now play the role as theengineer manager help me think throughwhat are the core features ofimplementing such game and then it willspit out the core functionalities.Obviously I can chat back and forth butonce I finish I can just say great nowlet's help me build the core MVPfeatures requirements into prd.txe usingthe example uh prd.txe tx as referencewhich is what we have uh showing hereand then you will see a prd has beencreated with good amount details and Iwill accept that. So now since we havethis prd generated the next step we canuse this command taskmaster parse drd tobreaking down this prd into small taskand this is where the power oftaskmaster begin. So I will do thistaskmaster parse prdscripts/prd.txt. Okay, so I had thisarrow uh just need making sure youremove this example and let's do itagain. So now it will start creatingtask files based on this prd and youwill see here where we have task folder.It has all the tasks that created fromtaskmaster. What we can do is we can dotaskmaster list and this will show youthe list of tasks that it has beencreated. What's really cool abouttaskmaster task list is on the rightside you can see here's a dependenciescolumn. So when breaking down tasks, itwill actually list out the task in alogical order and making sure there areclear dependencies mapped out. So whenit implement, it can implement in theright order. Meanwhile, there are alsosome pretty useful commands. You havethis command called analyze complexity.What this will do is that I can do taskmaster and analyze complexity. This wasbasically send all the task I created tocloud 3.7 as well as perplexity.Basically ask it to just evaluate howcomplicated or how difficult it is toimplement this feature. And once it isdone, I can do taskmaster complexityreport. It will show me the evaluationof each task and its complexity score.But what's really useful is for thosecomplex tasks, it also give you theprompt that you can copy. At the moment,you can't really copy this directly. Ifthe UI just break up, but you can justcopy the first one and go to complexityreport and find the specific ID which isthis one and we can copy the expansionprompt. So here it generate a promptdetailed technical implementation ofHTML 5 canva component including drawingtools input handling across all devices.So I can just do this and now itbreaking down that specific task intosmaller ones. And as we know once acomplex task breaking down to smallerone it is more likely to succeed withoutany error. And you can continue doingthat um by adding another one for thetask number five. So you get the drill.Um basically you can do this processback and forth for a few times untilyou're happy with the backlog here. Youcan also do things like update as well.So if later down the row you decide tolike change the plan, you can also dotaskmaster update ID equal to like fourand prompt equal to something like makesure we use three js. And what willhappen is that once you give thisprompt, it will actually update thewhole plan based on this new instructionwhich is really really helpful. But onceit's done, you can do taskmaster listwith subtasks. This will show allsubtask here directly. So it will makeit easier for you to review all the taskhere. So that's pretty much it. Once wedone this, you can just go to the cursoragent and say let's start implementingthe app based on task we created usingtaskmaster. Let's check the next mostimportant task first. So you might havethis arrow here that it is reusing thewrong command. Uh so I will just tell itdo not use script dev.js use taskmasterinstead. Just go list all task createdand follow the plan. Then it will seethe plan and decide to implement thefirst one first. And as it work on thetask, it will also set the status ofthis task to be in progress. And heresince I actually turn on the yolo modeof cursor, which means it didn't ask mefor permission for running any commandlines, I can basically just go drink acoffee and let it do the work. And as itcomplete, it will mark this task as doneand move on to the next one by doingtaskmaster next. But now when you're inEuro mode, uh I think cursor it willlimit to 25 coursees if you're using thecloud 3.7, but you can actually put onGemini 2.5 Pro Max. This will allow youto skip this limit and just do like 2002coursees without any pause here. Allright. So, it's actually pretty crazy.It just continue executing tasks one upanother and generate a whole bunch offiles, probably a few thousand lines ofcode. And let's just run that first. Um,so I'll do mpm run def. All right. So,if I try to open this, it has a lobbybuilding and authentication building.So, I can give a name, choose avatar,start playing, and my user has beencreated. I can set how much time we havefor drawing the difficulty and whetherit's public game or not. So it's prettygood. Uh I can create but okay lookslike the actual game inside hasn't beendone yet but it's pretty impressiveabout how much it is able to deliver injust one go. And I can come back to dotask master list with subtasks. So youcan see that it done the uh first fourtasks but it haven't fully finished thedevelopment game run logic into my UIcomponent. Maybe that's why the actualgame room is not showing up. So I canask it continue to implement but you sawthat I had this arrow here and then Ican prompt it now refract the errors youmade and creating new cursor rules tomaking sure you don't make thosemistakes again. Now you can see that itactually adding new cursor rules aboutnextjs app router. Uh though for somereason it didn't actually create contentwhich is bit weird and accept this one.So for now I just copy paste manually. Iprobably to update cursor rules tomaking sure it will be saved properly.But now I'm going to continue task. Nowlet's check what is the next task tocomplete to a point where we can do somequick testing of the drawing. Okay,after another 15 minutes of it justdoing the task by itself, I got thisgame that's kind of fully functionalwhere I can give it a name, choose myavatar, start playing and also create aroom called Jason's room. I can set atimer about how long people can draw aswell as number of runs, the difficultiesand if I create a room other people willbe able to see the room I created aswell. Click on join. We will seemultiple players in the room. And if Istart this, I will have this canva wherepeople can start drawing to describewhat this uh word is. And on the topright corner, there's also a timerdocument how much time is left. And onceit finish, it will send both result tochat GPT and GPT will look at the imageand give the description and evaluation,pick up the winner to get points andthen move on to the next one. So it'spretty amazing that it did a wholemultiplayers games like this by itselfin 20 minutes. So this how muchperformance gain you can get by equipcursor with the right task managementsystems and what's really exciting isthat this is just beginning. I canimagine those tools and system becameway better in a few months time. I alsointerviewed the creator of taskmasterproject where he gave more detailedbreakdown about the best practiceworkflow to fully unleash the power oftaskmaster and exciting things that theyare working on right now. If you'reinterested, you can join the AI builderclub where I put a full interview andworkflow inside the community for you tocheck out as well as bunch otherlearnings and tips from industry expertsfor both vibe coding and buildingproduction ready AI agents. And you willalso have access to tools like 10xcoderdev where it will help you generatebulletproof cursor PRD as well asnext.js boplay that already have allpayment backend database set up so youcan launch your SAS in just a weekend. Ipost a link in the description below foryou to join if you're interested. I hopeyou enjoyed this video. I continuesharing new tips and workflows Ilearned.",
    "summary": "This YouTube video discusses a technique to significantly reduce errors when using AI coding agents like Cursor: implementing a task management system. The speaker highlights the common problem of AI coding agents making mistakes due to a lack of overall understanding of project dependencies and a clear implementation plan.  The solution presented involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks and providing the AI agent with a centralized document (like a task.md file) to track progress and maintain context. The speaker showcases impressive results, having Cursor build a multiplayer online drawing game with minimal errors using this method.\n\nThe video then dives into specific tools and workflows that enhance this task management approach. Cloud Taskmaster, a command-line package, uses advanced models to parse Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into subtasks, considering dependencies and analyzing task complexity.  Rucode's Boomerang Task offers a similar function within VS Code, allowing users to create custom \"modes\" focused on planning and breaking down tasks. The speaker details their workflow using both tools, demonstrating how Taskmaster is integrated with Cursor to generate tasks, analyze complexity, and refine subtasks before Cursor begins implementation. They also highlight Rucode’s architecture agent that confirms the requirements and then plans the project out into features, user stories, components, state management, and project structure before switching to a code agent to execute the plan. The video ends with a demonstration of the multiplayer drawing game partially built by Cursor using the presented techniques, emphasizing the potential performance gains achieved by equipping AI coding agents with robust task management systems."

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl1r1XV0SLw",
    "addedAt": "06/26/2025",
    "transcript": "What is a vector database?Well, they say a picture is worth a thousand words.So let's start with one.Now in case you can't tell, this is a picture of a sunset on a mountain vista.Beautiful.Now let's say this is a digital image and we want to store it.We want to put it into a database and we're going to use a traditional database here called a relational database.Now what can we store in that relational database of this picture?Well we can put the actual picture binary data into our database to start with,so this is the actual image file but we can also store some other information as welllike some basic metadata about the picture so that would be.things like the file format and the date that it was created, stuff like that.And we can also add some manually added tags to this as well.So we could say, let's have tags for sunset and landscape and orange,and that sort of gives us a basic way to be able to retrieve this image,but it kind of largely misses the images overall semantic context.Like how would you query for images with similar color palettes for example using this informationor images with landscapes of mountains in the background for example.Those concepts aren't really represented very well in these structured fieldsand that disconnect between how computers store data how humans understand it has a name.It's called the semantic gap.Now traditional database queries like select star where color equals orange,it kind of falls short because it doesn't really capture the nuanced multi-dimensional nature of unstructured data.Well, that's where vector databases come in by representing data as mathematical vector embeddings.and what vector embeddings are,it's essentially an array of numbers.Now these vectors, they capture the semantic essence of the data wheresimilar items are positioned close together in vector space and dissimilar items are positioned far apart,and with vector databases, we can perform similarity searches as mathematical operations,looking for vector embeddings that are close to each other,and that kind of translates to finding semantically similar content.Now we can representall sorts of unstructured data in a vector database.What could we put in here?Well image files of course like our mountain sunset.We could put in a text file as well or we could even store audio files as well in here.Well this is unstructured data and these complex objects They are actually transformed into vector embeddings,and those vector embeddings are then stored in the vector database.So what do these vector embeddings look like?Well, I said there are arrays of numbersand there are arrays of numbers where each position represents some kind of learned feature.So let's take a simplified example.So remember our mountain picture here?Yep, we can represent that as a vector embedding.Now, let's say that the vector embedding for the mountain has a first dimension of say 0.91,then let's say the next one is 0.15, and then there's a third dimension of 0.83 and kind of so forth.What does all that mean?Well, the 0.91 in the first dimension, that indicates significant elevation changes because, hey, this is the mountains.Then 0.15 The second dimension here, that shows few urban elements,don't see many buildings here, so that's why that score is quite low.0.83 in the third dimension, that represents strong warm colors like a sunset and so on.All sorts of other dimensions can be added as well.Now we could compare that to a different picture.What about this one, which is a sunset at the beach?So let's have a look at the vector embeddings for the beach example.So this would also have a series of dimensions.Let's say the first one is 0.12, then we have a 0.08, and then finally we have a 0.89 and then more dimensions to follow.Now, notice how there are some similarities here.The third dimension, 0.83 and 0.89, pretty similar.That's because they both have warm colors.They're both pictures of sunsets,but the first dimension that differs quite a lot herebecause a beach has minimal elevation changes compared to the mountains.Now this is a very simplified example.In real machine learning systems vector embeddings typically contain hundreds or even thousands of dimensionsand I should also say that individual dimensions like this they rarely correspondto such clearly interpretable features, but you get the idea.And this all brings up the question of how are these vector embeddings actually created?Well, the answer is through embedding models that have been trained on massive data sets.So each type of data has its own specialized type of embedding model that we can use.So I'm gonna give you some examples of those.For example, Clip.You might use Clip for images.if you're working with text, you might use GloVe, and if you're working with audio, you might use Wav2vecThese processes are all kind of pretty similar.Basically, you have data that passes through multiple layers.And as it goes through the layers of the embedding model, each layer is extracting progressively more abstract features.So for images, the early layers might detect some pretty basic stuff, like let's say edges,and then as we get to deeper layers, we would recognize more complex stuff, like maybe entire objects.perhaps for text these early layers would figure out the words that we're looking at, individual words,but then later deeper layers would be able to figure out context and meaning,and how this essentially works is we take the high dimensional vectors from this deeper layer here,and those high dimensional vectors often have hundredsor maybe even thousands of dimensions that capture the essential characteristics of the input.Now we have vector embeddings created.We can perform all sorts of powerful operations that just weren't possible with those traditional relational databases,things like similarity search, where we can find itemsthat are similar to a query item by finding the closest vectors in the space.But when you have millions of vectors in your database and those vectors are made up of hundred or maybe eventhousands of dimensions,you can't effectively and efficiently compare your query vector to every single vector in the database.It would just be too slow.So there is a process to do that and it's called vector indexing.Now this is where vector indexing uses something called approximate nearest neighbor or ANN algorithmsand instead of finding the exact closest matchthese algorithms quickly find vectors that are very likely to be among the closest matches.Now there are a bunch of approaches for this.For example, HNSW, that is Hierarchical Navigable Small World that creates multi-layered graphs connecting similar vectors,and there's also IVF,that's Inverted File Index, which divides the vector space into clusters and only searches the most relevant of those clusters.These indexing methods, they basically are trading a small amount of accuracyfor pretty big improvements in search speed.Now, vector databases are a core feature of something called RAG, retrieval  augmented generation,where vector databases store chunks of documentsand articles and knowledge bases as embeddings andthen when a user asks a question, the system finds the relevant text chunks by comparing vector similarity?and feeds those to a large language model to generate responses using the retrieved information.So that's vector databases.They are both a place to store unstructured data and a place to retrieve it quickly and semantically.",
    "summary": "This video explains vector databases as a solution to the \"semantic gap\" that exists between how computers store data and how humans understand it. Traditional databases store data with metadata and tags, which is insufficient for complex queries like finding images with similar color palettes. Vector databases address this by representing data as mathematical vector embeddings, arrays of numbers that capture the semantic essence of the data. Similar items are positioned close together in \"vector space,\" allowing for similarity searches based on mathematical operations. The video illustrates this with a simplified example of mountain and beach sunset images, showing how dimensions in the vector embedding represent features like elevation and color.\n\nThe video explains that vector embeddings are created using embedding models trained on massive datasets. These models, like CLIP for images and GloVe for text, extract increasingly abstract features through multiple layers, eventually producing high-dimensional vectors that capture the essential characteristics of the input data. While this allows for powerful operations like similarity search, comparing a query vector to millions of others would be too slow. Therefore, vector indexing techniques using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms, like HNSW and IVF, are used to quickly find vectors that are very likely to be among the closest matches.\n\nThe video concludes by highlighting the core role of vector databases in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. In RAG, vector databases store chunks of documents and knowledge bases as embeddings, allowing the system to find relevant text chunks by comparing vector similarity. These retrieved chunks are then fed to a large language model (LLM) to generate responses, making vector databases both a storage and retrieval mechanism for unstructured data that prioritizes speed and semantic relevance."

    "transcript": "Another day, yet another CLI for doingAI code gen just dropped. I didn't thinkwe would see Google participate in thisrace. I really didn't, but it seems likethey're more and more scared of thethings that are happening on theanthropic side. They want to make surethey're ahead in every single possibleway. The Gemini CLI just dropped and itis really cool. I did not expect them togo full open source, but they did. Theywent so full on the full open sourcethat if we take a look at the license onGitHub, the Apache 2 license, theydidn't even fill out the copyright. Theyforgot to put in the year and thecompany name because this is clearlysome type of like semi-rogue effortinternally. They are going hard to makesure they get this out and they do itright. There's a lot to talk about here,both why they made this and how itworks, but more importantly, where theGemini CLI fits in the whole ecosystemof tools like it. There's a lot to diveinto here, but as you can guess,Google's not paying me anything to coverthis. In fact, using this is probablygoing to cost quite a bit of money. So,quick word from today's sponsor and thenwe'll dive right in. You might havenoticed that search got way better on T3Chat recently and it also supportspretty much every model. I wish I couldtake more credit for these improvements,but I really can't. Not just becauseJulius wrote the code, but because we'renot the ones doing the search. Exa is,and that's why I hit them up to sponsortoday's video. I am so pumped about theExa platform. It really is the searchtool that AI needs to succeed. And Ididn't realize how much we weresuffering trying to do this and all ofthe other ways you can do it. I couldtry and convince you by showing offtheir site, but I'd rather just show youthe code. Ignore the fact that we'reoverusing effect TS in here and try tojust focus on the simple parts. Wecreate an exa instance just by callingnew exa with the API key. And then wesearch exa.arch query. We get resultsand now we have these results as thesearch response. And then we can dowhatever we want to with that. In thiscase, we map it and flatten the data sothat we can send that as part of oursearch tool results and then send it toour AI in order to use it. You can alsogo through all of the content that itgives you and have Exa go to the pageand summarize the thing that it findsthere. You don't even need to do thesplit parts if you don't want to. We'redoing it because it's nice for the UI.You can literally just call await exasearch contents and get everything youneed like that. You don't even need touse it with AI. Obviously, it's reallynice to provide as a tool for your LLMsto use. But you don't have to. You canjust call it directly with whatever youwant. Like how compelling is this for astarting point? No more trying to workaround Google and captures and all theseother things. Just call their SDK. So,what's the catch? It's got to be superexpensive, right? Let's take a look. $5per 1,000 requests.Yes, really. I am floored at how cheapit is. For comparison, Google's searchgrounding for their models is $35 perthousand requests. That's insane. We'regoing to save so much money and get abetter experience for our users all bymoving to Exa. Don't make the mistakeswe did. Try out XA today atsoyv.link/exa.It seems really cool and like itfeatures most of the things you wouldwant it to do. I'm excited to digthrough the code and play with it withyou guys. But first, we should see whatthey have to say. It's free and opensource. Gemini CLI brings Geminidirectly into developers terminals withunmatched access for individuals. Fordevs, the command line interface CLIisn't just a tool, it's home. Theterminal's efficiency, ubiquity, andportability make it the go-to utilityfor getting work done. And as dev'sreliance on the terminal endures, sodoes the demand for integrated AIassistance. That's why we're introducingGemini CLI, an open- source AI agentthat brings the power of Gemini directlyinto your terminal. Provides lightweightaccess Gemini, giving you the mostdirect path from your prompt to ourmodel. While it excels at coding, webuilt Gemini CLI to do so much more.It's a versatile local utility you canuse for a wide range of tasks fromcontent generation and problem solvingto deep research and task management.Also integrating Gemini CLI withGoogle's AI coding assistant, the Geminicode assist, so that all devs on freestandard and enterprise code assistplans get promptdriven AI first codingin both VS Code and the Gemini CLI. Itis cool seeing them embrace VS Code. II've never seen Google acknowledge theexistence of competition as much as Ihave with the AI race. Like they're notin the old diluted Google bubble whereonly they exist. They're actuallyacknowledging that people prefer to useVS Code over the crappy Google web-basedinterfaces. It's nice for them toacknowledge the existing standardsinstead of trying to invent their ownthing. Even just them having an OpenAIcompatible API that's officiallydocumented shows how hard they areworking to get this all right. Unmatchedusage limits for individual devs. Thisis another one of those things thatGoogle can do that I think's underrated.Not only do they have massive benefitswith like their compute platform becausethey have their own CPUs andinfrastructure for inference and foractually training models. Not only dothey have the like platform everybodyneeds to host the models with and theapps and all these other parts and allthe data too, they have a ton of money.That's one of the most underrated thingsyou can have in the AI race because itlets you spend more money trainingmodels. It lets you buy more hardware tohave more provisioning so people don'tgo over limits. And it also means youcan just hand out for free. One ofthe biggest problems that we have nowwith T3 Chat is a lot of these providersare setting bad expectations where theyare giving somebody a $20 a month suband if they abuse it, they can costhundreds of dollars and OpenAI will justeat it or in this case, Google will justeat it. I can tell you confidently thata thousand requests per day costs Googlemoney, especially if you're using the 1million token context window. That'sinsane. That is absurd. So, let's justsay it's 200k tokens per requestaverage. It's probably more than that ifwe're doing like your whole codebaseprompting 1,000 requests per day. Let'sgo look at the Gemini costs. I know themoff the top of my head, but just so youguys know, I'm not bluffing. This isobviously with Pro. It's $2.50 forprompts over 200k tokens per milliontokens. It's a$125, so it's half ifwe're under 200k. There's a reason Ipicked 200k. You know what? We're goingto change it so we're using the highercost. So 200,1 tokens per request. Sowe're on the 250. That's $2.50 per 1 milinput. And it's 10, I believe, per millout. Oh, it's 15 when it's over 200.Good thing I checked. $15 per 1 mil out.And to be clear, there will be a lotmore input tokens than output tokens. Ithink they have a hard cap on how manyoutput tokens per request. We'll justcut it at a random limit. We'll sayinput tokens is 200,0001. We'll say8,000 output tokens per request. Thisends up being 200 million input tokensper day and 8 million output tokens.That is $500 a day of input tokens and$120 out. Do you see how hard they are the competition here? Googlesaid, \"You know what? We don't know howmuch people will use this. We're goingto put such insanely generous limitsthat they can do whatever they want to.We'll just eat the cost. That is $620plus dollars for a reasonable use case.If you're actually hitting the,000requests a day on it, that is insane. Ifthey squeeze that into like the $200tier or something, it would still bereally generous. This is free of chargeusing the free Gemini code assist.That's absurd. I see people sayingthat's not the price, that's the costthat they eat. Make sure you subtractthe profit. What do you think themultiplier is on something that's basedon like the GPU utilization? How muchprofit margin do you think Google has oninference? It's not much. These thingscost money to run. We know that becausewe have good open source models, too.And they're expensive as hell to run aswell. Best case, Google's profit marginis 50% on their traditional costs. Iwould guess it's lower. There's almostno way it's higher. So even if youfactor in Google's cut that they're nottaking here, 25060,that's still 300 bucks a day on a freetier account. It's insane to think thatthis just is magically erased becauseit's their costs. It's absurdly generousfor end users, but it's also absurdly Idon't want to say absurdly hostile, butit's quite hostile to competition. Wehad to change 2.5 Pro to be a premiummodel because we looked at the cost andit was our second most expensive modelper request. Not total, per request. Theaverage message to Gemini cost a lot ofmoney for 2.5 Pro. Enough that if youused even 300 requests on it, you're wayover the $8 a month you spend. In fact,doing a 100 requests with 2.5 Pro canget you pretty close to that $8 mark.So, we had to make it a premium model.And a bunch of people responded with,\"Why would I do that when I get a bunchof 2.5 pro requests for free from AIStudio? I get it. I understand. AIStudio is a terrible experience. And youdon't think they're going to keep thesedeals and prices around?\" No, this isthe embrace, extend, extinguishstrategy. This is the price yourcompetition out. And it's cool thatGoogle's aware enough of the competitionto do this, but this is a directresponse to what Claude did with the uhClaude Code $200 plan, which is 20x prousage. This plan allows you to useClaude code, as far as I know,effectively unlimited. You said 900messages with cloud every 5 hours orapproximately 200 to 800 prompts withclaude code every 5 hours. So if we takeeven like like the lower tier here, 200every 5 hours, that's 960 requests perday. Weird how close that is to athousand. It's almost like Anthropic'spaying close attention to this.That's 960 requests a day at the 200.Remember, it's 200 to 800. So it couldactually be more depending on where youend up falling in that. We're going toassume 200 because we're going to assumea large context size. Anthropics modelsare way lower context window size. So wehave to max it probably at like 100ktokens input. And we'll do the same8,000 tokens output. The $3 per 1 millin, 15 per one mil out. That's 960million input tokens a day. Wait, wheredid I do my math wrong that that'scoming out so different? Oh, it's 96million input tokens a day. 8 millionoutput tokens a day. Ends up being $288for the input. And it's the same outputpricing. So it's the same 120 for theoutput. This is the daily price.Remember, assuming you actually hitthese limits every day. And since it's a5 hour window, like you're not evensleeping, you're just prompting moreover and over. You can multiply thesetimes 30 days and you end up with areally scary number. That's $9,000 amonth that could theoretically cost ifyou were to just use the API directlyinstead. But you can get that for just$200 a month because Anthropic is bothgiving you more than you're paying forbecause they have the budget to eat thatand obviously they have the profitmargins too. The reason that they'redoing this is they want to get people sohooked on the anthropic models andproducts and everything that if theyhave to increase prices in the future orideally they can lower the cost ofrunning their models, they get peopleused to paying this much, they can winlong term. So, we went from cursorcosting 20 bucks a month with overagefees to Anthropic charging per tokenusage, which was the numbers people wereposting were insane, like thousands ofdollars a month dealing with Anthropicand Claude Code. And then they addedthis $200 a month plan. And then theyadded Cloud Code to it. And that's howwe get these crazy numbers, but they'rejust eating that at the 200 bucks amonth, which is crazy. They're justeating these costs. We can't do thatbecause we don't have billions ofdollars of funding and we also don'thave the ability to take over someoneelse's profit margin the way that theycan take over their own. So all of thiskind of sucks. Yeah, it's painful. Butalso good time to be a dev that wants touse these things. Being able to squeezeover $600 a day of value on a free tieron Gemini for as long as you possiblycan. Take advantage of that while youcan. And same deal with the anthropic.If you're using Cloud Code a lot, the200 bucks a month, if you're using it atthe limits they have, that's a reallygood value. The other bet they're makingis that of the people paying this, lessthan 1% will actually get close to thelimits. So, everyone else can just paythe 200 bucks a month, use $30 a monthof stuff, and make those margins work.That's enough about the pricing, though,because God, there's so much to thinkabout here. the the pricing wars aregoing to get crazier and crazier as wego, especially the like per token costwars, driving down the amount of GPUthat's necessary for all these things.Cost wars are going to get crazy. Thereare other wars I want to talk abouthere. Obviously, the experience wars,but the one I want to focus on first,the coding agents battle royale. Ithought this was a really cool concept.This is claude code versus a non-codeversus codeex, which is the OpenAI open-source cla code alternative. Open code,the one I previously covered and tookdown the video from from DAX amp codeand Gemini. I'm surprised that Aderdidn't make it in here, but pretty fun.All of them were told to find and killthe other processes. Last one standingwins. And in the first run, it lookslike open code won pretty hard. Yeah,open code immediately ran the process tofind all the other processes and thenstarted killing them before any of therest could figure it out and kill itback. Hilarious concept. I love this.Round two. They can only kill one at atime in Payne's close. Apparently, opencode thought it was Claude during thisone. System prompts are hard, man. Yeah,it thought it was Claude code, so itwouldn't kill Claude code, but it willkill the others. Open code's stillgoing.It declared victory because it thoughtit was Claude. So, when it saw theClaude code process, it didn't kill it.But Claude code is taking its time tofind the other process and kill it. Nowclaude code is catching up and is tryingto kill processes that have been deadfor a while cuz agentic back and forth.It doesn't have the current state. Thisis hilarious. I love this battle rail.Each gate the last one through getskicked. Run it 10k times to see whichone's the statistical winner. That wouldbe expensive as balls. If youwant to fund it prime, go nuts. Butyeah, I this is a great concept. Greatwork Sig Kitten on this. Genuinelyhilarious. Enough of that. Let's play alittle. Here's the repo. It's an actualopen source repo. I want to lurkcontributors. I am curious how much ofthis was inspired by slashcopied fromCodeex. Doesn't seem to have any of theCodex contributors. So I do think theystarted it from scratch themselves andthe codebase doesn't seem super familiarfrom the quick audit I did. It's beeninteresting seeing how much contributionit's been getting. Seems like TaylorMullen is the one really leading theeffort on it over at Google. They have adecent team on it. It's one of thebetter like varied contributor chartsthat I've seen for a tool like this.Usually it's like really heavy oneperson then nobody else contributingactively. They got a whole team here.Cool team. Lots of work. Seems likethey're still ramping up, not down.Those are all very good signs. The repojust went live today and it's alreadygot over 10k stars. Looking lively.Looks like they're being active. They'remerging changes. The real fun test isgoing to be, will they merge changesthat enable other models? Hunt forClaude.Does not seem anyone has spun up a PRfor other models. Understandable. Why norust npm? Really?I I hate devs. I really do. It's a CLI.It sits there and does nothing. Why doyou care about what language it'swritten in? I hate these people. Like IRust makes a lot of sense for a lot ofthings. It does not make sense forbuilding a userfacing product that isn'tlike CPU constrained at all. Like JS isobviously the better ecosystem oftooling and integrations for somethinglike this, especially with all of likethe web and stream parsing Goahead and rewrite it in Rust if you wantto. you'll see why it makes no sensebecause it won't feel any better for theusers. It really won't. Anyways, I willadmit that the biggest competition thatGoogle has with what they're buildingwith Gemini CLI is Codeex. And Codeex isplanning on rewriting in Rust. I did seethis a while back where they justrandomly put up a Rust package inside ofthe same repo. The TypeScript one isstill what you're installing and usingmost of the time, but they're tryingtheir best to maintain a 1:1 Rustrewrite. I've chatted with them a bunchabout this. Supposedly, there was acouple people internally that reallywanted it in Rust, as well as certaincustomers that don't want to have nodedependencies for anything. They justwant one single Rust binary. So, someonejust kind of went and rewrote it inRust. And Fued didn't have the balls tosay no. And now it is becoming a semi-blessed thing. The long-term plan is forthem to eventually have everything inRust, but they're still focusing on theTypeScript build for now because it'sway easier for them to set up, add newfeatures, try out things, and geteverything working. And the rest versionis kind of going to be like a line byline rewrite over. So for now, they'refocusing on iterating on the JS version,but getting the Rust one to a pointwhere it can become the default in thefuture. They're also hiring if you wantto work there. Cool. That said, I don'tthink it's necessary. I get that theyare convinced that they need to have away to do this with no dependencies.Cool. We'll see how that goes for them.I'm scared they're going to hurt theiriteration speed a ton if they fullycommit. Also, Apache 2 licensed also aton of stars. The one other bigdifference with the OpenAI version isthat they've already merged changes toallow non-openAI models. So you can useClaude and Gemini and everything elseyou want to here. Enough about thecompetition. I want to keep digging intohow this actually works. As shown, thisis a TypeScript project, which is reallycool they did it in Typescript and notlike JS or some weird They verywell could have, but they avoided itthankfully. Packages breaks down into acouple pieces. They also have av Codebecause again they're like actuallyembracing VS Code. This feels like itwas built by a modern team with modernproblems, which is very nice anddefinitely a change from the thing I'mused to seeing from Google. They got CLIand core as two separate pieces. Core isalmost certainly a lot of like pluggingwork to get attached to Google's off andeverything properly. You can see herefrom the depths that is the case. A tonof hotel stuff because of course is oneof the most annoying things to set up.They have websockets here for thecommunication layer and DC for fetch.Drip ANC for handling differentcharacter types almost certainly justWindows envfor rendering the diffs all this makessense so far I'm actually curious howthey are calling Google geni just tolike look at some of those calls hereare the partsjust a parser nothing too fun there howabout the tool section it's the tooldefinitionthey should confirm execute alwaysresolves else. That's fun. Interesting.Bunch of boilerplate TypeScript. It'swell documented though, so like workingwith this and using as a referenceshould be relatively easy.Non-interactive CLI.ts. Okay, now we'retalking. Get response text.[Music]All the pieces are so abstracted thatit's hard to track like the whole codeflow. I get it. Something like thisneeds to be relatively chaotic, butstill would have been cool to see moreof like how it's actually doing thework. You might also be noticing the tsxand confused like isn't this a CLI?Wouldn't this just be TypeScript.It is kind of weird that this file istsx because there is no JSX in it. Butthe reason all of the files in the CLIpackage are TSX is if you look at thepackage JSON, you'll see that they areusing ink. Ink is similar to like ReactNative but for CLI. It lets you useReact to write CLI which lets them moveway faster and build competently. Thatsaid, ink is not the fastest thing inthe world. And I often see people moveoff of their JS and TypeScript basedCLIs into Go and Rust. And it's notbecause JS is too slow. It's because Inkand React as a CLI experience is notnecessarily the fastest. And I wishwould explore moving off of Ink insteadof moving off of JS for their CLIs.Because Ink's a phenomenal startingpoint to build a good compelling userexperience in the CLI. It's notnecessarily the place you want to end uplong term. Shall I just try it? Let'sgive it a fun task. This is me workingon the branch where funny enough I'madding Gemini image genen to T3 chatwhich I haven't been able to ship notbecause it's not done or not workingbecause the rate limits for me on theAPI are awful.We are proceeding. Look at that. Theyhave themes. I wish to just use my CLItheme. We'll stick with that then. Loginwith Google. Gemini. Oh, that's funny.When I go up and down it CLIs are hard.Gemini code assistant. The Gemini CLIare now authorized to access yourterminal. Kind of funny that itredirects to a like docs page for thisbecause it's the only place they knowhow to throw you to. Left that in theUI. That's fun. Let me um rerun that.You can create a Gemini MD file tocustomize your interactions with Gemini.I already have an agents MD. I hope itcan use that. I'll give it a fun one. Soright now when we use the Gemini imagegen on T3 chat, it generates two images,but the preview is only one imagebecause OpenAI image gen has one imagewhen it generates. So the preview isjust one. It'd be nice if we couldrender two previews when it's going tobe two images.So let's ask it to do that and see howit does. I'm going to make a new branchbecause I don't trust any of thesetools. 100% of my context is still left.We'll see how this goes. Update themessage format UI for image generationduring generation. Right now it showsone preview placeholder when an image isgenerating but some models like imagegen 4 will generate two images. Itshould show two placeholdersin that case. Preparing a wittyresponse. Oh no. Let's see how it does.And like a real modern SF dev, I'lldrink my boba while we wait for this torun.Do I do allow once or allow always? Whatshould we do? I'll do allow once so wecan see the changes it makes. So it'sadding a new definition for how manyimages will be generated by thedifferent model. Here it doesn't show methe lines above that I actually careabout. First two lines hidden. What?What do you mean? I don't care. I want alot more than the first two lines. Thisfile is over a thousand lines. I want tosee more. I happen to know where this isin the codebase. So I happen to knowthat this is image and model and it'sgoing to generate two images becausethis is the Gemini one. We'll hit yesallow. Is it also going to add for GPTimage one that it's only generating one?Cool. Smart enough. Good start. is imagemodel image gen is image gen count.Sure. Control S to show more lines.We'll see why it's doing that. Just hitallow. Why not? You never know. Let'slet it run the PNPM lint. Let's see ifit worked.Retry. Oh, nope. It is stacking themvertical even though the actual previewis horizontal.So, let's get a follow-up. The previewsare stacking vertically, but the outputimages are shown horizontally onnonmobile displays. Make sure they matchbetter. Okay, there we go. We can seethe rest like this. I hate how the linesplits are happening when you need morespace. It's not the best UI I've seenfor this by a long shot. We'll allow it.Run lint. Rerun.And look at that. Good change. Now itwill generate placeholders that makesense for that. We should check and makesure it didn't break things for the GPTimage. Gen. Cool. Still the correctnumber of previews. Nice. My downloadbutton still work and name the fileproperly. It does. Awesome. Cool. Let'scompare with cloud code cuz that took abit of time and it didn't get it rightfirst try. And here's the numbers forhow much it took for tokens. That's400,000 input tokens for that. That'skind of nuts. and a minute 30 for APItime, too. Like, this cost actual money.If they were charging, this would havecost me like $8. I'd have spent $8 on achange that would have taken me like 25seconds to do myself. Benefits andnegatives. You get the idea. So, let'sstash this.Can I grab the exact prompt I submittedhere quick? Let's do that. Copy. Pastein same prompt this time with cloudcode. Let's see how it does. There's alot of little UX things I think ClaudeCode got really well. My favorite thingis the like hotkey experience where whenit's doing things, you can controlr toexpand, escape to interrupt, enter toaccept, command enter to let it justauto accept. A lot of little things itdoes there that I find really nice. It'sgoing pretty ham on the usage though. Ialso gave it a big hint with message-format UI because the the file thatmatters is message-format.tsx. tsx. So,it should know. I was not smart enoughto check my git stash and see the rightanswer there. We shall see. We're stillpretty far in this generating step. 19tool calls, 50,000 tokens, all for thefirst step of finding and examining thecurrent solution. To be fair, two of thefiles it has to touch are huge files,like massive files. People are saying ineach chat that Gemini felt faster. It'sbecause it was showing us diffs earlier.Claude code is much more focused on theplanning stage, finding things andmaking sure its plan is correct beforeit starts changing code at all. Findimage count logic. It's not going tofind that. It can feel free to hunt.It's going to go through 15 files andrealize that none of them have what it'slooking for. This will be fun. Ihonestly thus far I'm actually impressedwith the Gemini one. It solved thisproblem much quicker. We are over theamount of time it took for the Geminione to solve everything, including myfollowup by almost 2x. And we haven'tseen any diff yet at all. Interesting.Here it's asking us no. Tell Claude whatto do differently. The number of imagesis not currently encoded anywhere. Do Itell it to include it or just hardcodethe difference? Um, I'll tell it toinclude it. Add the number of images asan optional field in models.tsx.GPT image one should have one image andimage in 4 should have two. Told it whatto do. This is making me more temptedthan ever to do the like break down allof the CLIs video where I give all ofthem three different tasks in likedifferent sandboxes and see how theyperform. I've wanted to do that for awhile, but I'm more tempted than evernow. Number images. Uh, yep. And you canshift tab to tell it to not keepconfirming things. But I'm just going tohit enter so we can keep seeing thechanges it makes. Could it not havechanged the GPT image one thing at thesame time? It's literally four linesbelow. No, it has to use anotherthousand tokens instead. This will befunny. Looks like the code diff might beworse, too, because it should havechanged the is image model to use theflag. But let's see what this diff is. Ilike that it always puts out the actualdiff. I don't like that it breakshighlighting when it like line wraps.Small thing, but notable. And flex. Flexwrap. Gap three. That should be done.New gen 4. Look at that. It actually gotit right first try. That's cool. Did agood job. But how much did it use?Interesting. It used haiku a bunch forlike parsing things and then claudesonnet. A lot less tokens overall. Ashitload of cash read and write though.1.2 2 million tokens of cash read 126kcash right the total cost is only like adollar the duration was insane from 90seconds to almost 5 minutes and I alsohad to interrupt at some point and tellit that it was doing things wrong sotechnically it wasn't first try in thatregard but since it asked me if it couldrun the command and it gave me a way outI could stop it during gen instead ofhaving to correct it after gen both dida decent job if you do want to try opencode just make sure you're doing the onethat's SST/open code on GitHub There aretwo now and it's very confusing. Thehistory is dramatic and uh I'm choosingat this point to stay out of it. SSTopen code is the real one. This is theone to support. This is the one thatwill actually continue going forward.Other ones sketchy. We'll just leave itthere. Let's do it. Um I might need toset up the models. It might just use thekey I already have in this because Ihave environment variables for all thesethings already. Cool. Yeah, since Ialready have environment variablesbecause this codebase uses open AIandropic and all these other models, itwas smart enough to grab the key and useit already. Pretty useful. Yeah, this UIis the best by far. Open code isstunning. And like having the contextand things on the bottom here, it likefits my T-U setup properly. It looks thebest by far. I like the cost ticker inthe corner, too, so you can watch yourbank account empty itself because unlikethe Google one and the anthropic one,they can't do a subscription modelbecause they don't own the models or theproviders. They expect you to bring yourown API key and then eat the cost. So,Open Code's kind of screwed by thesethings because 200 bucks a month forliterally tens of thousands of dollarsof usage or on Gemini it's free for thesame levels of usage. Like that hurts.Apparently, they can get around theanthropic limits by using your ClaudeOOTH in order to use your max planthrough an API endpoint that's kind ofhidden, but that will almost certainlybe patched up in the future. We willsee. I did see a cool comment from chatthat I want to call out. Adam, who ifyou guys don't know is one of the leaddevs on Open Code, uses Open Codehimself. And anytime something bugssimmer doesn't look right, he fixes it.Stuff comes out nice when you build itfor yourself. I agree. Almost all ofthese CLIs have that as the case. I knowfor a fact that Cloud Code started cuzsomebody wanted it internally and usedit internally. They almost didn'trelease it because it was so popularinternally. They were scared it wastheir edge they were giving up. I knowCodex was the same deal that Fouedad hadbeen working on it for a while for hisown use and slowly infected other teamsat OpenAI with it until they eventuallygot permission to release it and that isalso the case with open code. All ofthese tools as far as I know are beingused by the people who are building themwhich is essential for their success.Okay, one annoying thing about OpenCode, since they're doing the custombackground color and I'm using T-Mox,when I go into manual scroll, it mightbe hard to see with YouTube compression,but you can clearly see the black linewhere their background starts becausethe terminal look back with T-Mux isn'tsmart enough to maintain their custombackground color. One small thing, justa thing that I noticed. Slash share tocreate a sharable link. What is ittalking about there? Added the number ofimages field. Cool. So, it figured outthat it needs to do that. shared modelstsx 180. Cool. Now, let's see if I canget the final piece right. I thought itadded the config. Did it really justwrite like hard-coded values afterknowing the right values? Okay, there'ssomething going on here where it'sscroll doesn't show me what I want. Theymust have their own custom scrollhotkeys. Do they? Can I just page up init? Oh, cool. You can page up inside ofit. Okay. Gen image count model string.Okay. Okay. Yeah, it is hard coding itthere even though it added itsupposedly. Updated to show the correctnumber of placeholders during imagegeneration. Changes include modelspecific image counts and messageformat. Uh let me see what it actuallychanged. Okay, it changed markdowncontent internal to have the hard-codedvalues there. Flex wrap gap 3. Okay, itdid the simplest change, but it shouldstill work. Look at that. It's the onlyone that with no additional promptingand no additional interruptions got itright first try. That's really cool. So,of the three that we tried, which areOpen Code by DAX and Atom at SST,Gemini's new CLI, and Claude Code, theyall behaved very differently, but ClaudeCode was really impressive. But OpenCode just kind of did the right thingand the rest didn't. It was also thecheapest by the looks of it. It was 5cents. Is that right? It doesn't give aa breakdown after, but it only cost 5cents. Everything else cost over adollar. I don't know how they managed toget the token costs way cheaper, but Ithink they just reduce how much stuff ithas to hit if it doesn't have to. That'sreally impressive. Maybe the likebilling difference doesn't matter somuch if they put that much work in. Itdoesn't say this anymore, but previouslythey said here like that they recommendanthropic models because it was cheaper.Well, evolve the gaps between them willclose and pricing will drop. So beingprovider agnostic is important. Yeah.Previously, this said something alongthe lines of the anthropic models arethe cheapest and also the most reliable,which was cool because they could useless. But it's very impressive that itwas as cheap as it was. Althoughanthropic models are more expensive pertoken, they can be cheaper if you giveit less context and you get a rightanswer sooner using less output tokens.So, it's possible. Just interesting tosee them being the cheapest option hereby far. I'm very impressed. Yeah, opencode is very good. They're winning meover fast here. Yeah, that one was byfar the fastest and the best. So,there's still a lot of room for theseother providers to grow, it seems. Butpretty cool that Open Code did thatwell. That's a huge, huge win for them.And I definitely need to do thisbreakdown comparing all of the solutionsmore in depth in the near future. Youhave my interest to say the absoluteleast. I'm excited. Simon did abreakdown of the Gemini CLI. I have tocover it cuz in particular, he managedto get the system prompts. I mean,they're available cuz it's all opensource, but it's really cool to take alook at. him and I are both surprised athow significant this category hasbecome. I had assumed that the terminaltools like this would always besomething of a niche interest, but giventhe number of people I've heard fromspending hundreds of dollars a month oncloud code, this niche is clearly largerand more important than I had thought. Ihad a few days of early access to theGemini one. It's very good, takesadvantage of Gemini's million tokencontext, and has good taste in thingslike when to read a file and when to runa command, like open codeex. And unlikecloud code, it's open source. Apache 2.Cloud code is the only big one that'snot open source, which is veryinteresting. Full source code is in theGemini CLI on GitHub. The courses andprops live in source core prompts tsextracted them out as a renderedmarkdown guest. Those imprompt doublesas extremely accurate and concisedocumentation of what the tool can do.Here's what it has to say aboutcomments, for example. Add code commentssparingly. Focus on why something isdone, especially for complex logic,rather than what is done. Only add highvvalue comments if necessary for clarityor if requested by the user. Do not editcomments that are separate from the codeyou are changing. Never talk to the useror describe your changes throughcomments. Seems like a lot of the systemprompt is getting around Gemini's, we'llcall them quirky behaviors. When keytechnologies aren't specified, preferthe following: React, JavaScript,TypeScript with Bootstrap CSS,incorporating material design principlesfor UIUX.On one hand, I am proud of them for notshilling Google stuff too hard here. Onthe other hand, I am disappointed theywon't embrace Tailwind. Funny though,back end is node with express or Pythonwith fast API. Fine. Full stack next.Very interesting to see. Using bootstrapCSS and material design principles forfront end or Python. Django/flask.Pick one, man. Come on. You could havehad such good bro points if you just putDjango here and didn't force Simon, thecreator of Django, to put Flask in hisblog post. Come on, guys. With React andView frontend style with booster up CSSand material design principles. Yep.CLI's Python or Go. They say with theirCLI that they wrote in Typescript.This is funny actually. Mobile app.Apparently, Cotlin multiplatform ispretty good, but Flutter is a choice toput in here. 3D games HTML CSSJS with3JS. 2D games HTML CSSJS. SpecifyPhaser. If you don't, you're going towish hell upon your users. It only has asmall set of tools though. It does haveweb search using grounding, which iscool. Other than that, it's not got toomany tools, which makes sense if you useGemini. One of the things that I'm mostexcited about with the CLI actually hasnothing to do with using it. It's thefact that the people building it areGoogle employees. So, they get todiscover firsthand how atrociously badGemini can be about tool calls.Sometimes it just says what it's goingto do and then doesn't do it. And nowthey have to deal with that. And I knowfor a fact they're working on it becausenot only have Logan and others repliedto my posts complaining about it,saying, \"We're on it. We're gonna fixthis.\" I've actually had a couple peoplesurprisingly high up at Google reach outto me looking for my tests where Ishowed Gemini just not doing the toolcalls so they could repro it and try toget it working. I'm assuming on theirown internal versions of the models.This is a great test bed for them tofigure out why 2.5 models are so muchworse at tool calling than the 2 modelswere. To this day, the tool call modelthat I find the best from Gemini forjust like calling tools in the rightplace reasonably is actually 20 flash ofall models. As smart as 25 Pro is and asfast and capable as it is at coding, itstool call reliability hasn't been greatfor me. And this shows that they areworking hard to fix it. They did give ita limited set of tools, which I think isboth to not overload Gemini with weirdthings it can do, but also to make sureit can do the right set of focusedthings and see how it performs. It fixthese problems. I would hope that theyby now have a benchmark internally wherethey can run Gemini CLI with new Geminimodels and make sure that it calls toolsproperly and performs as expected. Theyreally need help in this regard and Ihope that the Gemini CLI gives them theopportunity to fix some of those things.We do not specify if using the free tierwill allow them to train on your code,which means we can assume it probablydoes. I wish they would be really clearand upfront with that. You can also dropyour own paid API key, at which pointyour data won't be used forimprovements, but your build on thetoken usage, which as we saw is kind ofinsane. As always, Simon's killing it.Really appreciate him for writing thisfor us so that we have a betterreference point. Good stuff.This is a longass system prompt,actually.examples, illustrating tone workflow.Giving models examples helps a ton. So,I'm not surprised they did this. Itmakes a lot of sense that they did. Andthen a final reminder at the end. Veryinteresting.Very interesting. Good stuff. It'sgenuinely awesome to see more and moreof these model companies building CLIs.Not because I think we should all beusing different CLIs from thesedifferent providers, but it's actuallyone of the best ways to dog food all ofthese pieces and understand thecharacteristics of your models. Thecodec as well as the codec like websitefor background agent stuff might not bethe best thing OpenAI's ever released,but it's forcing them to spend way moretime working their hardest in order toget all the pieces together. likeunderstanding how they come together,what their models are good at, whattheir models are bad at, and how toorchestrate this whole world together.They become much better users of themodels by building tools like this. AndI think that the most exciting part ofall these CLIs is that their creationallows the models to improve at thethings that make this work so that wecan go do cool stuff with them, too. Ifthis results in Gemini becoming betterat tool calls, it was worth theinvestment and then some. And if it endsup being one of the better CLIs, that'sreally cool and awesome, too. If codeexgets fully sunset, but we got bettertool call behaviors in the open AImodels because of it. Awesome. And Idon't know if Anthropic can learnlessons, but it would be cool if theydid, too. Tried to do tailwind. So, youwanted to make tailwind the option.That's really cool. System promptsdynamic. A lot gets trimmed out.Depending on if it's a sandboxexecution, it will include differentrecommendations depending on theplatform.If it's in git, then it will includethat there. That's really cool.It includes a dynamic example if it's agit repo. Interesting. They even leftwhat what seems to me like a debug flag,but a really useful one where you canget it to write the system prompt to afile. So, you can look at it after therequest goes. If I'm understanding thiscorrect, that's really cool as a way forusers to to get this and play with it.This is like a really open open sourceproject in the traditional way. Frell,the lead contributor here. It's greatfor iteration. We thought folks wouldenjoy playing with it. That's reallycool. That is really cool that they'relike giving this stuff out for people toplay with and do what they want to.There's a ton of potential for a toollike this that is this flexible. Likehaving the system prompt all just be onefile with pretty simple like if elsestatements. Oh, also you can read acustom system prompt here if you wantto. So you can just write your own andreturn that instead. Huge. That's reallyreally cool. There's a lot of good stuffgoing on here. Yeah. Gemini/systemmd ifyou want to override. Dope. You canactually have it write to a path andthen read from the same path. Liveupdating to system. That's really cool.You can like hop in there and makechanges. That's there's a really coolpotential there. I like that. I haven'tseen any of the other tools do that yet.Good stuff. There's like actualinteresting innovation going on here.It's cool that every one of theseprojects has pushed the state-of-the-artforward some amount. OpenAI codeexreally broke new ground pushing for opensource. Open code's working really hardon like the UX and integrations. So youcan open up a web view to see thingsgoing on. Eventually you can command itfrom the mobile app. Gemini CLI isfocused on being really open andcustomizable. So you can include yourown system prompts. You can see theintrospection as it's going. These areall really cool. I'm pumped about thestate of this stuff. It's getting betterevery day and it's getting cooler andmore useful, too. This is great. I lovethe transparency. I love the fact thatone of the lead devs hopped in chat justto make sure that we're covering thisright and that we know all the coolestparts. I love that. Like whatever'sexciting to them is exciting to me, too.Apparently, there is an extensions.mmdin the docs. That is worth checking out,too. Looks in two locations, extensionsand on home. Extensions. So, you canconfigure for your whole computerextensions that Gemini can access withthe CLI. Good precedence behaviors.Gemini extension JSON MCP serversupport. So you can configure an MCPglobally on your computer by justputting it in that folder. That's reallycool. Or if it's in the workspace, youcan commit this via code. That's huge.Name version MCP server context filename. Name of the file that contains thecontext for the extension. That's reallycool actually. Ton of potential withthis. That's awesome. Thank you so muchfor showing up and giving thisadditional information, man. It's reallygood. And I'm happy I could cover allthe cool things about the Gemini CLI. Iwill make it a point to play with thisone more. I've been using cloud codemore recently, but after trying out opencode, I need to use that a lot more,too. There's also aer, which iseverything I've heard about has beenphenomenal and from my experience ispretty damn good, too. It was kind oflike the pioneer of these AI CLI codegentools. It's hard to go wrong now,though. All of these are really good andimpressive. And if you want to see mebreak down literally all of them andcompare the best and worst of them, letme know and I'll do my best to do thatin the near future. Seriously though,just go play with these. Especially nowthat the price is as cheap or free as itis for a ton of these things. Future'sbright. This stuff's really fun. Let meknow what you guys think. And until nexttime, peace nerds.",
    "summary": "The video discusses Google's newly released, open-source Gemini CLI (Command Line Interface), a tool for AI code generation. The creator is impressed with Google's aggressive entry into the market, directly challenging Anthropic's Claude Code. A key highlight is the extremely generous usage limits offered for free, which he calculates could cost Google hundreds of dollars per day per user. He compares this to Anthropic's Claude Code $200 plan, highlighting the pricing wars and potential \"embrace, extend, extinguish\" strategy at play. The video also features a sponsored segment about Exa, a search platform optimized for AI, touted as a cost-effective and superior alternative to Google's search grounding.\n\nThe video dives into a practical comparison between Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and SST's open-source Codeex, tasking them with a code modification challenge. Interestingly, Codeex (SST/open code on GitHub) emerges as the winner, delivering the correct solution most efficiently and at the lowest cost. This sparks further discussion about Codeex's superior UX, integrations, and provider-agnostic approach. The video highlights Gemini CLI's open-source nature and customizability, particularly its unique system prompt override feature. A key takeaway is how each of these tools pushes the state-of-the-art forward, dogfooding the models and improving their performance in the process.\n\nThe video concludes with the creator expressing excitement about the rapid advancements in AI-powered terminal tools and their growing importance. He reviews a blog post from Simon (creator of Django) about system prompts for Gemini CLI. He praises the transparency and open approach of the Gemini CLI team, fueled by community collaboration. He emphasizes the benefits of such tools, even if one doesn't actively use them, for the overall improvement of the underlying AI models, especially regarding tool call reliability. He encourages viewers to explore these tools, particularly given the current competitive pricing landscape."
